

Ezr 1:1 In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia — to fulfil the word of Yahweh spoken through Jeremiah -Yahweh
roused the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia to issue a proclamation and to have it publicly displayed throughout his
kingdom:

Ezr 1 :2 “Cyrus king of Persia says this, ‘Yahweh, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth
and has appointed me to build him a Temple in Jerusalem, in Judah.

Ezr 1 :3 Whoëver among you belongs to the full tally of his people, may his God be with him! Let him go up to
Jerusalem, in Judah, and build the Temple of Yahweh, God of Israel, who is the God in Jerusalem.

Ezr 1 :4 And let each survivor, wherever he lives, be helped by the people of his locality with silver, gold,
equipment and riding beasts, as well as voluntary offerings for the Temple of God which is in Jerusalem’”.

Ezr 1 :5 Then the heads of families of Judah and of Benjamin, the priests and the Levites, in fact all whose spirit
had been roused by God, prepared to go and rebuild the Temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem;

Ezr 1 :6 and all their neighbours gave them every kind of help: silver, gold, equipment, riding beasts and



valuable presents, in addition to their voluntary offerings.

Ezr 1 :7 Furthermore, King Cyrus handed over the articles belonging to the Temple of Yahweh which
Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem and put in the temple of his god.

Ezr 1 :8 Cyrus king of Persia handed them over to Mithredath the treasurer who checked them out to
Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah.

Ezr 1 :9 The inventory was as follows: thirty gold dishes; one thousand silver dishes, twenty-nine repaired;

Ezr 1:10 thirty gold bowls; a thousand silver bowls, four hundred and ten damaged; one thousand other articles.
Ezr 1:11 In all, five thousand four hundred articles of gold and silver. Sheshbazzar took all these with him when
he led the exiles back from Babylon to Jerusalem.

Ezr 2:1 These were the people of the province who returned from the captivity of the Exile, those whom
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had deported to Babylon, and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to
his own town.

Ezr 2:2 They were the ones who arrived with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Nahamani,
Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum and Baanah. The number of the men of the people of the country of

Ezr 2:56 sons of Jaalah, sons of Darkon, sons of Giddel,

Ezr 2:57 sons of Shephatiah, sons of Hattil, sons of Pochereth-ha-Zebaim, sons of Ami.

Ezr 2:58 The total of the temple slaves and the sons of Solomon’s slaves: three hundred and ninety-two.

Ezr 2:59 The following, who came from Tel-Melah, Tel-Harsha, Cherub, Addan and Immer, could not prove that
their families and ancestry were of Israelite origin:

Ezr 2:60 the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda: six hundred and fifty-two.

Ezr 2:61 And among the sons of the priests: the sons of Habaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, the sons of Barzillai —
who had married one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, whose name he adopted.

Ezr 2:62 These had looked for their entries in the official genealogies but were not to be found there, and were
hence disqualified from the priesthood.

Ezr 2:63 Consequently, His Excellency forbade them to eat any of the consecrated food until a priest appeared
who could consult urim and thummim.

Ezr 2:64 The whole assembly numbered forty-two thousand, three hundred and sixty people,

Ezr 2:65 not counting their male and female slaves to the number of seven thousand three hundred and thirty-
seven. They also had two hundred male and female singers.

Ezr 2:66 Their horses numbered seven hundred and thirty-six, their mules two hundred and forty-five,

Ezr 2:67 their camels four hundred and thirty-five and their donkeys six thousand seven hundred and twenty.

Ezr 2:68 When they arrived at the Temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem, a certain number of heads of families made
voluntary offerings for the Temple of God, for its rebuilding on its site.

Ezr 2:69 In accordance with their means they gave sixty-one thousand gold drachmas, five thousand silver
minas and one hundred priestly robes to the sacred treasury.

Ezr 2:70 The priests, the Levites and some of the people settled in Jerusalem; the singers, the gatekeepers and
the temple slaves in their appropriate towns; and all the other Israelites in their own towns.

Ezr 3:1 When the seventh month came after the Israelites had been resettled in their towns, the people
gathered as one person in Jerusalem.

Ezr 3:2 Then Jeshua son of Jozadak, with his brother priests, and Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, with his brothers,
set about rebuilding the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings on it as prescribed in the Law of Moses
man of God.

Ezr 3:3 They erected the altar on its old site, despite their fear of the people of the country, and on it they
presented burnt offerings to Yahweh, burnt offerings morning and evening;

Ezr 3:4 they celebrated the feast of Shelters as prescribed, offering daily the number of burnt offerings required
from day to day,

Ezr 3:5 and in addition presented the continual burnt offerings prescribed for the Sabbaths, for the New Moons
and for all the festivals sacred to Yahweh, as well as those voluntary offerings made by individuals to Yahweh.
Ezr 3:6 From the first day of the seventh month they began presenting burnt offerings to Yahweh, though the
foundations of the Temple of Yahweh had not yet been laid.

Ezr 3:7 They also contributed money for the masons and carpenters, and food, drink and oil for the Sidonians
and Tyrians for bringing cedar wood from Lebanon by sea to Jaffa, for which Cyrus king of Persia had given
permission.

Ezr 3:8 It was in the second month of the second year after their arrival at the Temple of God in Jerusalem that
Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak, with the rest of their brothers, the priests, the Levites
and all the people who had returned to Jerusalem from captivity, began the work by appointing some of the
Levites who were twenty years old or more to superintend the work on the Temple of Yahweh.

Ezr 3:9 The Levites, Jeshua, his sons and his brothers, with Kadmiel, Binnui and his sons, the sons of
Hodaviah, agreed to superintend the men working on the Temple of God.

Ezr 3:10 When the builders had laid the foundations of the Temple of Yahweh, the priests in their robes stood
forward with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise Yahweh according to the
ordinances of David king of Israel.



Ezr 3:1 1 They chanted praise and thanksgiving to Yahweh because for Israel, they said, “he is good, and
everlasting in his faithful love”. Then all the people raised a mighty shout of praise to Yahweh, since the
foundations of the Temple of Yahweh had now been laid.

Ezr 3:12 Many of the older priests, Levites and heads of families, who had seen the first temple, wept very
loudly when the foundations of this one were laid before their eyes, but many others shouted aloud for joy,

Ezr 3:13 so that nobody could distinguish the noise of the joyful shout from the noise of the people’s weeping;
for the people shouted so loudly that the noise could be heard far away.

Ezr 4:1 When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the exiles were building the Temple of Yahweh,
God of Israel,

Ezr 4:2 they came to Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the heads of families and said, “Let us help you build, for we
resort to your God as you do and we have been sacrificing to him since the time of Esarhaddon king of Assyria,
who brought us here”.

Ezr 4:3 Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the other heads of Israelite families replied, “It is out of the question that you
should join us in building a Temple for our God. We shall build for Yahweh, God of Israel, on our own, as King
Cyrus king of Persia has commanded us”.

Ezr 4:4 The people of the country then set about demoralising the people of Judah and deterring them from
building;

Ezr 4:5 they also bribed counsellors against them to frustrate their purpose throughout the lifetime of Cyrus king
of Persia right on into the reign of Darius king of Persia.

Ezr 4:6 In the reign of Xerxes, at the beginning of his reign, they drew up an accusation against the inhabitants
of Judah and Jerusalem.

Ezr 4:7 In the days of Artaxerxes, Mithredath, Tabeel and their other associates wrote to Artaxerxes king of
Persia against Jerusalem; the text of the letter was written in Aramaic writing and dialect.

Ezr 4:8 Then Rehum the governor and Shimshai the secretary wrote a letter to King Artaxerxes, denouncing
Jerusalem as follows:

Ezr 4:9 “From Rehum the governor and Shimshai the secretary and their other associates, the judges, the
legates, the Persian officials, the people of Uruk, Babylon and Susa — that is, the Elamites-
Ezr 4:10 and the other peoples whom the great and illustrious Ashurbanipal deported and settled in the towns of
Samaria and in the rest of Transeuphrates”.

Ezr 4:1 1 This is the text of the letter which they sent him: “To King Artaxerxes, from your servants the people of
Transeuphrates:

Ezr 4:12 “May the king now please be informed that the Jews, who have come up from you to us, have arrived
in Jerusalem and are rebuilding the rebellious and evil city; they have begun rebuilding the walls and are laying
the foundations;

Ezr 4:13 and now the king should be informed that once this city is rebuilt and the walls are restored, they will
refuse to pay tribute, tax or toll, thus the king will incur a loss;

Ezr 4:14 and now, because we eat the palace salt, it is not proper for us to see this affront offered to the king;
we therefore send this information to the king

Ezr 4:15 so that a search may be made in the archives of your ancestors: in which archives you will find and
learn that this city is a rebellious city, the bane of kings and provinces, and that sedition has been stirred up
there from ancient times; that is why this city was destroyed.

Ezr 4:16 We inform the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are restored, you will soon have no territories
left in Transeuphrates”.

Ezr 4:17 The king sent this reply: “To Rehum the governor, to Shimshai the secretary, and to their other
associates resident in Samaria and elsewhere in Transeuphrates: Greetings!

Ezr 4:18 “And now, the document which you sent us has been accurately translated for me,

Ezr 4:19 and by my orders search has been made, and it has been found that this city has rebelled against the
kings in the past and that revolt and sedition have been contrived in it;

Ezr 4:20 and that powerful kings have reigned in Jerusalem, governing the whole of Transeuphrates and
exacting tribute, tax and toll;

Ezr 4:21 now give orders for these men to cease work; this city is not to be rebuilt until I give the order.

Ezr 4:22 Beware of acting negligently in this matter. Why should the harm grow, to endanger the king?”.

Ezr 4:23 As soon as the text of King Artaxerxes’ document had been read to Rehum the governor, Shimshai the
secretary and their associates, they hurried to the Jews in Jerusalem and stopped their work by force of arms.
Ezr 4:24 Work on the Temple of God in Jerusalem then ceased, and was discontinued until the second year of
the reign of Darius King of Persia.

Ezr 5:1 When the prophets Haggai and Zechariah son of Iddo prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and
Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel who was over them,

Ezr 5:2 Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak began rebuilding the Temple of God in



Jerusalem; with them were the prophets of God, supporting them.

Ezr 5:3 It was then that Tattenai governor of Transeuphrates, Shethar-Bozenai and their associates came to
them and asked, “Who gave you the order to rebuild this Temple and complete this structure?

Ezr 5:4 What are the names of the men putting up this building?”.

Ezr 5:5 But the eyes of their God were watching over the elders of the Jews, so they were not forced to stop
until a report could reach Darius and an official reply about the matter could be received from him.

Ezr 5:6 A copy of the letter which Tattenai, governor of Transeuphrates, Shethar-Bozenai and his associates,
the officials in Transeuphrates, sent to King Darius.

Ezr 5:7 They sent him a report which ran as follows: “To King Darius, hearty greetings!

Ezr 5:8 “The king should be informed that we went to the province of Judah, to the Temple of the great God,
which is being rebuilt with large stones; beams are being embedded in the walls; the work is being carried out
energetically and is making good progress.

Ezr 5:9 Questioning these elders, we asked them, ‘Who gave you permission to rebuild this Temple and
complete this structure?’.

Ezr 5:10 We also asked them their names, to inform you, so that we could record the names of the men who
were their leaders.

Ezr 5:1 1 “They gave us the following answer, ‘We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth; we are
rebuilding the Temple built many years ago, which a great king of Israel had built and completed.

Ezr 5:12 But because our ancestors angered the God of heaven, he handed them over to Nebuchadnezzar the
Chaldaean king of Babylon who destroyed this Temple and deported the people to Babylon.

Ezr 5:13 In the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, however, King Cyrus issued an official order that this Temple
of God should be rebuilt;

Ezr 5:14 furthermore, those gold and silver articles belonging to the Temple of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had
removed from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to the temple of Babylon, King Cyrus in turn removed from
the temple of Babylon and handed back to a certain Sheshbazzar whom he had appointed governor.

Ezr 5:15 He said to him, “Take these articles; go and return them to the Temple which is in Jerusalem and let
the Temple of God be rebuilt on its original site;”

Ezr 5:16 this Sheshbazzar then came and laid the foundations of the Temple of God in Jerusalem, and it has
been under construction ever since, and is not yet finished’.

Ezr 5:17 “Hence, if it please the king, let search be made in the royal treasuries in Babylon, to find out if it is true
that an official order was issued by King Cyrus for this temple of God in Jerusalem to be rebuilt; and let the king’s
decision on this matter be sent to us”.

Ezr 6:1 Then, on the order of King Darius, search was made in the archives deposited in the treasuries in
Babylon

Ezr 6:2 and a scroll was found in the fortress of Ecbatana, which ran as follows: “Memorandum.

Ezr 6:3 “In the first year of King Cyrus, King Cyrus issued this order: ‘Temple of God in Jerusalem. ‘The Temple
is to be rebuilt as a place of offering sacrifice and its foundations retained. Its height is to be sixty cubits, its width
sixty cubits,

Ezr 6:4 with three layers of large stones and one layer of timber. The cost is to be met by the royal treasury.

Ezr 6:5 Furthermore, the gold and silver articles belonging to the Temple of God which Nebuchadnezzar took
from the Temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon are to be given back and returned to the temple in
Jerusalem, each to its proper place, and deposited in the Temple of God’.

Ezr 6:6 “Hence, Tattenai governor of Transeuphrates, Shethar-Bozenai and your associates, the officials of
Transeuphrates, keep away from there!

Ezr 6:7 Leave the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews alone, to get on with their work on that
Temple of God; they are permitted to rebuild that Temple of God on that site.

Ezr 6:8 And herewith are my instructions as to how you will assist these elders of the Jews in the rebuilding of
that Temple of God: the cost is to be paid in full to these men from the royal revenue, that is, from the taxes of
Transeuphrates, and without interruption.

Ezr 6:9 And whatever is required — young bulls, rams, lambs for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, wheat,
salt, wine, oil, as the priests in Jerusalem request — is to be given them day by day without fail,

Ezr 6:10 so that they may offer sacrifices acceptable to the God of heaven and pray for the life of the king and
his sons.

Ezr 6:1 1 Furthermore I have issued an instruction that if anyone disobeys this order, a beam is to be torn from
his house, he is to be impaled on it and his house is to be reduced to a rubbish-heap for his offence;

Ezr 6:12 and may the God who has caused his name to live there overthrow the king of any people who dares
to defy this and destroy that Temple of God in Jerusalem! I, Darius, have issued this order. Let it be punctiliously
obeyed!”.

Ezr 6:13 Tattenai governor of Transeuphrates, Shethar-Bozenai and their associates punctiliously obeyed the



instructions sent by King Darius;

Ezr 6:14 and the elders of the Jews made good progress over their building, thanks to the prophetic activity of
the prophet Haggai and Zechariah son of Iddo, completing the reconstruction in accordance with the command
of the God of Israel and the order of Cyrus and of Darius.

Ezr 6:15 This Temple was completed on the twenty-third day of the month of Adar, in the sixth year of the reign
of King Darius.

Ezr 6:16 The Israelites — the priests, the Levites and the remainder of the exiles - joyfully celebrated the
dedication of this Temple of God;

Ezr 6:17 for the dedication of this Temple of God they offered one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four
hundred lambs and, as a sin offering for all Israel, twelve he-goats, corresponding to the number of the tribes of
Israel.

Ezr 6:18 Then they installed the priests in their orders and the Levites in their positions for the ministry of the
Temple of God in Jerusalem, as prescribed in the Book of Moses.

Ezr 6:19 The exiles celebrated the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.

Ezr 6:20 The Levites, as one man, had purified themselves; all were pure, so they sacrificed the Passover for all
the exiles, for their brothers the priests and for themselves.

Ezr 6:21 So the Israelites who had returned from exile and all those who had renounced the filthy practices of
the people of the country to join them in resorting to Yahweh, God of Israel, ate the Passover.

Ezr 6:22 For seven days they joyfully celebrated the feast of Unleavened Bread, for Yahweh had given them
cause to rejoice, having moved the heart of the king of Assyria in their favour to support them in their work on the
Temple of God, the God of Israel.

Ezr 7:1 After these events, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra son of Seraiah, son of Azariah, son of
Hilkiah,

Ezr 7:2 son of Shallum, son of Zadok, son of Ahitub,

Ezr 7:3 son of Amariah, son of Azariah, son of Meraioth,

Ezr 7:4 son ofZerahiah, son of Uzzi, son of Bukki,

Ezr 7:5 son of Abishua, son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of the chief priest Aaron-

Ezr 7:6 this Ezra came up from Babylon. He was a scribe versed in the Law of Moses, which Yahweh, God of

Israel, had given. The king gave him everything that he asked for, since the hand of Yahweh his God was over

him.

Ezr 7:7 A number of Israelites, priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers and temple slaves went up to Jerusalem in
the seventh year of the reign of King Artaxerxes.

Ezr 7:8 Ezra arrived in Jerusalem in the fifth month, in the seventh year of the king’s reign;

Ezr 7:9 for he had ordered the departure from Babylon on the first day of the first month, and he arrived in
Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month, since the kindly hand of his God was over him.

Ezr 7:10 For Ezra had devoted himself to studying the Law of Yahweh so as to put into practice and teach its
statutes and rulings.

Ezr 7:1 1 This is the text of the document which King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra, the priest-scribe, a student of
matters pertaining to Yahweh’s commandments and statutes relating to Israel:

Ezr 7:12 “Artaxerxes, king of kings, to the priest Ezra, Secretary of the Law of the God of heaven: greetings!

Ezr 7:13 “Now here are my orders. All members of the people of Israel in my kingdom, including their priests and
Levites, who freely choose to go to Jerusalem, may go with you,

Ezr 7:14 for you are being sent by the king and his seven counsellors to investigate how the Law of your God, in
which you are expert, is being applied in Judah and Jerusalem,

Ezr 7:15 and to transport the silver and gold which the king and his counsellors have voluntarily offered to the
God of Israel who resides in Jerusalem,

Ezr 7:16 as well as all the silver and gold which you receive throughout the province of Babylon and the
voluntary offerings freely contributed by the people and the priests for the Temple of their God in Jerusalem.

Ezr 7:17 “This money you will punctiliously use for the purchase of bulls, rams, lambs and the materials for the
oblations and libations which go with them, offering these on the altar of the Temple of your God in Jerusalem,
Ezr 7:18 and using the remainder of the silver and gold in accordance with the will of your God as you and your
brothers may think fit.

Ezr 7:19 “You will deliver the articles which have been given you for the ministry of the Temple of your God, to
the God of Jerusalem,

Ezr 7:20 and whatever else is needed and you are obliged to supply for the Temple of your God, you will supply
from the royal treasury.

Ezr 7:21 “I, King Artaxerxes, have issued the following instruction to all the treasurers of Transeuphrates:
Whatever the priest Ezra, Secretary of the Law of the God of heaven, may request of you is to be punctiliously
complied with:



Ezr 7:22 up to one hundred talants of silver, one hundred <i>kor</i> of wheat, one hundred bat of wine, one hundred
bat of oil, and unlimited salt.

Ezr 7:23 Whatever the God of heaven demands for the Temple of the God of heaven must be diligently
provided; why should retribution come on the realm of the king and of his sons?

Ezr 7 :24 You are further informed that it is against the law to impose tribute, tax or toll on any of the priests,
Levites, singers, gatekeepers, temple slaves or other servants of this temple of God.

Ezr 7:25 “And you, Ezra, by virtue of the wisdom of your God, which you possess, are to appoint magistrates
and scribes to administer justice for the whole people of Transeuphrates, that is, for all who know the Law of
your God; and you are to teach it to those who do not know it.

Ezr 7 :26 And on anyone who will not comply with the Law of your God and the Law of the king let sentence be
swiftly executed, whether it be death, banishment, fine or imprisonment”.

Ezr 7:27 Blessed be Yahweh, God of our ancestors, who moved the king’s heart in this way to restore the
beauty of the Temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem,

Ezr 7:28 won for me the faithful love of the king, his counsellors and all the most powerful of the king’s officials!
Taking heart since the hand of Yahweh my God was over me, I assembled those Israelite heads of families who
were to go with me.

Ezr 8:1 These, with their genealogies, were the heads of families who set out from Babylon with me in the reign
of King Artaxerxes:

Ezr 8:2 Of the sons of Phinehas: Gershom; of the sons of Ithamar: Daniel; of the sons of David: Hattush

Ezr 8:3 son of Shechaniah; of the sons of Parosh: Zechariah, and with him a hundred and fifty males officially

registered;

Ezr 8:4 of the sons of Pahath-Moab: Elioenai son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred males;

Ezr 8:5 of the sons of Zattu: Shechaniah son of Jahaziel, and with him three hundred males;

Ezr 8:6 of the sons of Adin: Ebed son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males;

Ezr 8:7 of the sons of Elam: Jeshaiah son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males;

Ezr 8:8 of the sons of Shephatiah: Zebadiah son of Michael, and with him eighty males;

Ezr 8:9 of the sons of Joab: Obadiah son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen males;

Ezr 8:10 of the sons of Bani: Shelomith son of Josiphiah, and with him a hundred and sixty males;

Ezr 8:11 of the sons of Bebai: Zechariah son of Bebai, and with him twenty-eight males;

Ezr 8:12 of the sons of Azgad: Johanan son of Hakkatan, and with him a hundred and ten males;

Ezr 8:13 of the sons of Adonikam: the younger sons, whose names are: Eliphelet, Jeiel and Shemaiah, and with
them sixty males;

Ezr 8:14 and of the sons of Bigvai: Uthai son of Zabud, and with him seventy males.

Ezr 8:15 I assembled them near the canal which runs to Ahava, where we camped for three days. I noticed
laymen and priests, but I could not discover any Levites there.

Ezr 8:16 I then sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah and Meshullam,
judicious men,

Ezr 8:17 and sent them to Iddo, the leading man of a place called Casiphia; I told them what they were to say to
Iddo and his kinsmen, living at the place called Casiphia, that is, to provide us with people to serve the Temple of
our God.

Ezr 8:18 And because the hand of God was good to us, they sent us a wise man of the sons of Mahli son of
Levi, son of Israel, a certain Sherebiah with his sons and kinsmen: eighteen men;

Ezr 8:19 also Hashabiah and with him his brother Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari with his kinsmen and sons:
twenty men;

Ezr 8:20 and two hundred and twenty temple slaves — descendants of the temple slaves whom David and the
princes had assigned to serve the Levites — all of them designated by name.

Ezr 8:21 There, beside the Ahava Canal, I then proclaimed a fast, to humble ourselves before our God and to
pray to him for a successful journey for us, our dependants and all our belongings.

Ezr 8:22 For I should have been ashamed to ask the king for a company of cavalry to protect us from hostile
people on our road, as we had already said to the king, “The hand of our God is over all who seek him for their
protection, but his mighty retribution befalls all those who forsake him”.

Ezr 8:23 So we fasted and pleaded with our God about this, and he heard us.

Ezr 8:24 I next chose twelve of the leading priests, and also Sherebiah and Hashabiah with ten of their kinsmen.
Ezr 8:25 To them I weighed out the silver, the gold and the utensils, the contributions which the king, his
counsellors, his notables and all the Israelites there present had made for the Temple of our God.

Ezr 8:26 To them I weighed out and handed over six hundred and fifty talants of silver, one hundred utensils of
silver valued at two talants, one hundred talants of gold,

Ezr 8:27 twenty golden bowls valued at a thousand darics and two utensils of fine burnished copper as precious
as gold.



Ezr 8:28 I said to them, “You are consecrated to Yahweh; these utensils are consecrated too; the silver and gold
are a voluntary offering to Yahweh, God of your ancestors.

Ezr 8:29 Guard them carefully until you weigh them out to the leading priests, the Levites, and the heads of
families of Israel in Jerusalem in the rooms of the Temple of Yahweh”.

Ezr 8:30 The priests and Levites then took charge of the silver, the gold and the utensils thus weighed, to bring
them to Jerusalem to the Temple of our God.

Ezr 8:31 On the twelfth day of the first month we left the Ahava Canal to make our way to Jerusalem; the hand
of our God was over us and protected us from enemies and surprise attacks on our way.

Ezr 8:32 When we arrived in Jerusalem, we rested for three days.

Ezr 8:33 On the fourth day the silver, the gold and the utensils were weighed in the Temple of our God and
handed over to the priest Meremoth son of Uriah and, with him, Eleazar son of Phinehas; with them were the
Levites Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui.

Ezr 8:34 By number and weight all was there. The total weight was recorded at the same time.

Ezr 8:35 When the exiles arrived from their captivity, they offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel — twelve
bulls on behalf of all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-two lambs, and as a sin offering twelve he-goats: the whole
of this as a burnt offering to Yahweh.

Ezr 8:36 They also delivered the king’s instructions to the king’s satraps and the governors of Transeuphrates,
who then supported the people and the Temple of God.

Ezr 9:1 Once this was done, the officials approached me to say, “The people of Israel, the priests and the
Levites, have not renounced the disgusting practices of the people of the country — the Canaanites, the Hittites,
the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Moabites, the Egyptians and the Amorites-

Ezr 9:2 since they and their sons have married some of their women, as a result of which the holy race has
been contaminated by the people of the country. The officials and leaders have been the worst offenders in this
act of infidelity”.

Ezr 9:3 On hearing this, I tore my clothes and my cloak; I pulled hair from my head and beard and sat down in
horror.

Ezr 9:4 All who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered round me, when faced with the infidelity of
the exiles, while I went on sitting there in horror until the evening sacrifice.

Ezr 9:5 At the evening sacrifice I came out of my stupor and, falling on my knees in my torn clothes and cloak,
stretched out my hands to Yahweh my God,

Ezr 9:6 and said: “My God, I am ashamed, I blush to lift my face to you, my God. For our iniquities have
increased, until they are higher than our heads, and our guilt has risen as high as heaven.

Ezr 9:7 From the days of our ancestors until now we have been deeply guilty and, because of our iniquities, we,
our kings and our priests, have been handed over to the kings of other countries, to the sword, to captivity, to
pillage, to shame, as is the case today.

Ezr 9:8 And now, for a brief moment, the favour of Yahweh our God has allowed a remnant of us to escape and
given us a stable home in his holy place, so that our God can raise our spirits and revive us a little in our slavery.
Ezr 9:9 For we are slaves; but God has not forgotten us in our slavery; he has extended his faithful love to us
even under the kings of Persia and revived us to rebuild the Temple of our God, restore its ruins and provide us
with a refuge in Judah and in Jerusalem.

Ezr 9:10 But now, our God, what can we say after this? For we have abandoned your commandments,

Ezr 9:1 1 which you gave through your servants the prophets in these terms, ‘The country which you are about
to possess is a polluted country, polluted by the people of the country and their disgusting practices, which have
filled it with their filth from end to end.

Ezr 9:12 Hence you are not to give your daughters in marriage to their sons, or let their daughters marry your
sons, or ever concern yourselves about peace or good relations with them, if you want to grow stronger, to live
off the fat of the land and bequeath it to your sons for ever’.

Ezr 9:13 “After all that has befallen us because of our evil deeds and our deep guilt — though you, our God, have
punished us less than our iniquities deserved and have allowed us to escape like this-
Ezr 9:14 are we to break your commandments again and intermarry with people with these disgusting
practices? Would you not be enraged with us to the point of destroying us, leaving neither remnant nor survivor?
Ezr 9:15 Yahweh, God of Israel, you are upright. We survive only as the remnant we are today. We come before
you in our guilt; because of it we cannot stand in your presence”.

Ezr 10:1 While Ezra, weeping and prostrating himself in front of the Temple of God, was praying and making
confession, a very large crowd of men, women and children of Israel gathered round him, the people weeping
bitterly.

Ezr 1 0:2 Then Shechaniah son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, spoke up and said to Ezra, “We have been
unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the people of the country. But, in spite of this, there is still
some hope for Israel.



Ezr 10:3 We will make a covenant with our God to send away all the foreign wives and their children in
obedience to the advice of my lord and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God. Let us act in
accordance with the Law.

Ezr 10:4 Go ahead, do your duty; we support you. Be brave, take action!”.

Ezr 10:5 Then Ezra stood up and put the leading priests and Levites and all Israel on oath to do what had been
said. They took the oath.

Ezr 10:6 Ezra then left his place in front of the Temple of God and went to the room of Jehohanan son of
Eliashib, where he spent the night without eating food or drinking water, because he was still mourning over the
exiles’ infidelity.

Ezr 10:7 A proclamation was issued throughout Judah and Jerusalem that all the exiles were to assemble in
Jerusalem,

Ezr 1 0:8 and that anyone who failed within three days to answer the summons of the officials and elders was to
forfeit all his possessions and himself be excluded from the community of the exiles.

Ezr 10:9 As a result, all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled in Jerusalem within the three days; it was
the twentieth day of the ninth month. All the people sat down in the square in front of the Temple of God,
trembling because of the matter in hand and because of the heavy rain.

Ezr 10:10 The priest Ezra then stood up and said to them, “You have been unfaithful and have married foreign
wives, thus adding to Israel’s guilt.

Ezr 10:1 1 So now give thanks to Yahweh, God of your ancestors, and do his will by holding aloof from the
people of the country and from foreign wives”.

Ezr 10:12 In ringing tones, the whole assembly answered, “Yes, our duty is to do as you say.

Ezr 10:13 But there are many people here and it is the rainy season; we cannot stay out in the open; besides,
this is not something that can be dealt with in one or two days, since many of us have been unfaithful over this.
Ezr 10:14 Let our officials deputise for the whole community, and all the people in our towns who have married
foreign wives can come at stated times, accompanied by elders and judges from each town, until our God’s
fierce anger over this is turned away from us”.

Ezr 10:15 Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah, supported by Meshullam and Shabbethai
the Levite, were opposed to this.

Ezr 10:16 The exiles did as had been proposed. And the priest Ezra selected the family heads of the various
families, all of them by name, who began their sittings on the first day of the tenth month to look into the matter.
Ezr 10:17 And by the first day of the first month they had dealt with all the men who had married foreign women.
Ezr 10:18 Among the priests who were found to have married foreign wives were: of the sons of Jeshua son of
Jozadak and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib and Gedaliah,

Ezr 10:19 who agreed to send their wives away; their guilt offering was a ram from the flock for their guilt;

Ezr 10:20 of the sons of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah;

Ezr 1 0:21 of the sons of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel and Uzziah;

Ezr 1 0:22 of the sons of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad and Elasah;

Ezr 10:23 of the Levites: Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah — that is, Kelita-Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer;

Ezr 10:24 of the singers: Eliashib and Zaccur; of the gatekeepers: Shallum, Telem and Uri;

Ezr 10:25 and of the Israelites: of the sons of Parosh: Ramiah, Izziah, Malchijah, Mijamin, Eleazar, Malchijah
and Benaiah;

Ezr 1 0:26 of the sons of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth and Elijah;

Ezr 10:27 of the sons of Zattu: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad and Aziza;

Ezr 1 0:28 of the sons of Bebai: Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, Atlai;

Ezr 1 0:29 of the sons of Bigvai: Meshullam, Malluch, Jedaiah, Jashub, Sheal, Jeremoth;

Ezr 1 0:30 of the sons of Pahath-Moab: Adna, Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui and
Manasseh;

Ezr 1 0:31 of the sons of Harim: Eliezer, Isshijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,

Ezr 10:32 Benjamin, Malluch, Shemariah;

Ezr 1 0:33 of the sons of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, Shimei;

Ezr 1 0:34 of the sons of Bani: Maadai, Amram, Uel,

Ezr 10:35 Benaiah, Bediah, Jeluhi,

Ezr 10:36 Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,

Ezr 10:37 Mattaniah, Mattenai and Jaasau;

Ezr 1 0:38 of the sons of Binnui: Shimei,

Ezr 10:39 Shelemiah, Nathan and Adaiah;

Ezr 10:40 of the sons of Zaccai: Shashai, Sharai,

Ezr 10:41 Azarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah,

Ezr 10:42 Shallum, Amariah, Joseph;



Ezr 10:43 of the sons of Nebo: Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, Joel, Benaiah.

Ezr 10:44 All these had married foreign wives but sent them away with their children.

Neh 1:1 The words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah. It happened in the month of Chislev, in the twentieth year,
while I was in the citadel of Susa,

Neh 1 :2 that Hanani, one of my brothers, arrived with some men from Judah. I asked them about the Jews —
those who had escaped and those who survived from the captivity — and about Jerusalem.

Neh 1:3 They replied, The survivors remaining there in the province since the captivity are in a very bad and
demoralised condition: the walls of Jerusalem are in ruins and its gates have been burnt down”.

Neh 1 :4 On hearing this I sat down and wept; for some days I mourned, fasting and praying before the God of
heaven.

Neh 1:5 I said, “Yahweh, God of heaven — the great and awe-inspiring God who keeps a covenant of faithful
love with those who love him and obey his commandments-

Neh 1 :6 let your ear be attentive and your eyes open, to listen to your servant’s prayer, which I now offer to you
day and night on behalf of your servants the Israelites. I admit the sins of the Israelites, which we have
committed against you. Both I and my father’s House have sinned;

Neh 1:7 we have acted very wickedly towards you by not keeping the commandments, laws and rulings which
you enjoined on your servant Moses.

Neh 1 :8 Remember, I beg you, the promise which you solemnly made to your servant Moses, ‘If you are
unfaithful, I shall scatter you among the peoples;

Neh 1 :9 but if you come back to me and keep my commandments and practise them, even though those who
have been banished are at the very sky’s end, I shall gather them from there and bring them back to the place
which I have chosen as a dwelling-place for my name’.

Neh 1:10 Since they are your servants, your people, whom you have redeemed with your mighty power and
strong hand,

Neh 1:11 O Lord, let your ear now be attentive to your servant’s prayer and to the prayer of your servants who
want to revere your name. I beg you let your servant be successful today and win this man’s compassion”. At the
time I was cupbearer to the king.

Neh 2:1 In the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, since I was in charge of the wine, I took
the wine and offered it to the king. Now, he had never seen me looking depressed before.

Neh 2:2 So the king said to me, “Why are you looking depressed? You are not sick! This must be a sadness of
the heart”. Thoroughly alarmed by this,

Neh 2:3 I said to the king, “May the king live for ever! How can I not look depressed when the city where the
tombs of my ancestors are lies in ruins and its gates have been burnt down?”.

Neh 2:4 The king then said to me, “What would you like me to do?”. Praying to the God of heaven,

Neh 2:5 I said to the king, “If the king approves and your servant enjoys your favour, send me to Judah, to the
city of the tombs of my ancestors, so that I can rebuild it”.

Neh 2:6 The king — with the queen sitting beside him-said, “How long will your journey take, and when will you
come back?”. Once I had given him a definite time, the king approved my mission.

Neh 2:7 I then said to the king, “If the king approves, may I be given orders for the governors of Transeuphrates
to let me pass through on my way to Judah?

Neh 2:8 Also an order for Asaph, keeper of the king’s forest, to supply me with timber for the beams of the gates
of the citadel of the Temple, for the city walls and for the house which I am to occupy?”. These the king granted
me because the kindly hand of my God was over me.

Neh 2:9 When I reached the governors of Transeuphrates, I gave them the king’s orders. The king had sent an
escort of army officers and cavalry along with me.

Neh 2:10 When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the official of Ammon heard about this, they were
exceedingly displeased that someöne had come to promote the welfare of the Israelites.

Neh 2:1 1 And so I reached Jerusalem. After I had been there three days,

Neh 2:12 I got up during the night with a few other men — 1 had not told anyone what my God had inspired me to
do for Jerusalem — taking no animal with me other than my own mount.

Neh 2:13 Under cover of dark I went out through the Valley Gate towards the Dragon’s Fountain as far as the
Dung Gate, and examined the wall of Jerusalem where it was broken down and its gates burnt out.

Neh 2:14 I then crossed to the Fountain Gate and the King’s Pool, but it was impassable to my mount.

Neh 2:15 So I went up the Valley in the dark, examining the wall; I then went in again through the Valley Gate,
coming back

Neh 2:16 without the officials knowing where I had gone or what I had been doing. So far I had said nothing to
the Jews: neither to the priests, the nobles, the officials nor any other persons involved in the undertaking.

Neh 2:17 I then said to them, “You see what a sorry state we are in: Jerusalem is in ruins and its gates have
been burnt down. Come on, we must rebuild the walls of Jerusalem and put an end to our humiliating position!”.



Neh 2:18 And I told them how the kindly hand of my God had been over me, and the words which the king had
said to me. At this they said, “Let us start building at once!”. and they set their hands to the good work.

Neh 2:19 When Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the official of Ammon, and Geshem the Arab heard about this,
they laughed at us and jeered. They said, “What is this you are doing? Are you going to revolt against the king?”.
Neh 2:20 But I gave them this answer, “The God of heaven will grant us success and we, his servants, mean to
start building; as for you, you have neither share nor right nor memorial in Jerusalem”.

Neh 3:1 Eliashib the high priest with his brother priests then set to work and rebuilt the Sheep Gate; they made
the framework, hung its doors, fixed its bolts and bars and proceeded as far as the Tower of the Hundred and
the Tower of Hananel.

Neh 3:2 The men of Jericho built next to him; Zaccur son of Imri built next to them.

Neh 3:3 The sons of Ha-Senaah rebuilt the Fish Gate; they made the framework, hung its doors and fixed its
bolts and bars.

Neh 3:4 Meremoth son of Uriah, son of Hakkoz, carried out repairs next to them; Meshullam son of Berechiah,
son of Meshezabel, carried out repairs next to him; and Zadok son of Baana carried out repairs next to him.

Neh 3:5 The men of Tekoa carried out repairs next to him, though their nobles would not demean themselves to
help their masters.

Neh 3:6 Joiada son of Paseah and Meshullam son of Besodeiah repaired the gate of the New Quarter; they
made the framework, hung its doors and fixed its bolts and bars.

Neh 3:7 Next to them repairs were carried out by Melatiah of Gibeon, Jadon of Meronoth, and the men of
Gibeon and Mizpah, for the sake of the governor of Transeuphrates.

Neh 3:8 Next to them repairs were carried out by Uzziel son of Harhaiah, a member of the metal-workers’ guild,
and next to him repairs were carried out by Hananiah of the perfumers’ guild. These renovated the wall of
Jerusalem as far as the Broad Wall.

Neh 3:9 Next to them repairs were carried out by Rephaiah son of Hur, who was head of one half of the district
of Jerusalem.

Neh 3:10 Next to them Jedaiah son of Harumaph carried out repairs opposite his own house; next to him repairs
were carried out by Hattush son of Hashabneiah.

Neh 3:1 1 Malchijah son of Harim and Hasshub son of Pahath-Moab repaired another section as far as the
Furnace Tower.

Neh 3:12 Next to them repairs were carried out by Shallum son of Hallohesh, head of the other half of the
district of Jerusalem, by him and his sons.

Neh 3:13 Hanun and the inhabitants of Zanoah repaired the Valley Gate: they rebuilt it, hung its doors and fixed
its bolts and bars; they also repaired a thousand cubits of wall up to the Dung Gate.

Neh 3:14 Malchijah son of Rechab, head of the district of Beth-ha-Cherem, repaired the Dung Gate; he rebuilt it,
hung its doors and fixed its bolts and bars.

Neh 3:15 Shallum son of Col-Hozeh, head of the district of Mizpah, repaired the Fountain Gate; he rebuilt it,
roofed it, hung its doors and fixed its bolts and bars. He also rebuilt the wall of the Pool of Siloah, adjoining the
king’s garden, as far as the steps going down from the City of David.

Neh 3:16 After him, Nehemiah son of Azbuk, head of half the district of Beth-Zur, carried out repairs from a point
opposite the Davidic Tombs to the artificial pool and the House of the Champions.

Neh 3:17 After him, repairs were carried out by the Levites: Rehum son of Bani; and next to him Hashabiah,
head of one half of the district of Keilah, carried out repairs for his own district.

Neh 3:18 After him, repairs were carried out by their brothers: Binnui son of Henadad, head of the other half of
the district of Keilah.

Neh 3:19 Next to him, Ezer son of Jeshua, headman of Mizpah, repaired another section in front of the ascent
to the armoury at the Angle.

Neh 3:20 After him, Baruch son of Zabbai repaired another section from the Angle to the door of the house of
Eliashib the high priest.

Neh 3:21 After him, Meremoth son of Uriah, son of Hakkoz, repaired another section from the door of Eliashib’s
house as far as the end of Eliashib’s house.

Neh 3:22 And after him repairs were carried out by the priests who lived in the district.

Neh 3:23 After them repairs were carried out by Benjamin and Hasshub, opposite their own house. After them
repairs were carried out by Azariah son of Maaseiah, son of Ananiah, beside his own house.

Neh 3:24 After him, Binnui son of Henadad repaired another section from Azariah’s house as far as the Angle at
the corner.

Neh 3:25 After him, Palal son of Uzai carried out repairs in front of the Angle and the tower projecting from the
king’s Upper Palace by the Court of the Guard; and after him, Pedaiah son of Parosh carried out the repairs
Neh 3:26 to a point by the Water Gate to the east and the projecting tower.

Neh 3:27 After him, the men of Tekoa repaired another section from in front of the great projecting tower as far



as the wall of Ophel.

Neh 3:28 From the Horse Gate onwards repairs were carried out by the priests, each in front of his own house.
Neh 3:29 After them repairs were carried out by Zadok son of Immer in front of his house, and after him repairs
were carried out by Shemaiah son of Shechaniah, keeper of the East Gate.

Neh 3:30 After him Hananiah son of Shelemiah and Hanun sixth son of Zalaph repaired another section, after
whom repairs were carried out by Meshullam son of Berechiah in front of his room.

Neh 3:31 After him Malchijah, of the metal-workers’ guild, repaired as far as the Hall of the temple slaves and
merchants, in front of the Muster Gate, as far as the upper room at the corner.

Neh 3:32 And between the upper room at the corner and the Sheep Gate repairs were carried out by the
goldsmiths and the merchants.

Neh 3:33 When Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became furiously angry.

Neh 3:34 He ridiculed the Jews and in front of his kinsmen and the aristocracy of Samaria he exclaimed, “What
are these pathetic Jews doing … ? Are they going to give up? Or offer sacrifices? Or complete the work in a
day? Can they put new life into stones taken from rubbish heaps and even charred?”.

Neh 3:35 And beside him Tobiah of Ammon remarked, “If a jackal were to jump on what they are building, it

would knock their stone wall down!”.

Neh 3:36 Listen, our God, for we are despised! Make their sneers fall back on their own heads! Send them as
booty to a land of captivity!

Neh 3:37 Do not pardon their wickedness, may their sin never be erased before you, for they have insulted the
builders to their face!

Neh 3:38 Meanwhile we were rebuilding the wall, which was soon joined up all the way round to mid-height; the
people put their hearts into the work.

Neh 4:1 When Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites and the Ashdodites heard that repairs to the walls
of Jerusalem were going forward — that the gaps were beginning to fill up — they became very angry,

Neh 4:2 and they all plotted to come and attack Jerusalem and upset my plans.

Neh 4:3 We, however, prayed to our God and organised a guard day and night to protect the city from them.

Neh 4:4 But in Judah the saying went, “The strength of the carrier falters, the rubbish heap is so vast that by
ourselves we cannot rebuild the wall!”.

Neh 4:5 And our opponents said, “They will never know or see a thing, until we are in there among them, and
then we shall massacre them and put a stop to the work”.

Neh 4:6 Now when the Jews who lived near them had warned us ten times over, “They are coming up against
us from every place they live in”,

Neh 4:7 men took up position in the space behind the wall at those points where it was lowest, and I organised
the people by families with their swords, spears and bows.

Neh 4:8 Aware of their anxiety, I then addressed the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, “Do not be
afraid of them. Remember the great and awe-inspiring Lord and fight for your kinsmen, your sons, your
daughters, your wives and your homes”.

Neh 4:9 Once our enemies heard that we were forewarned and that God had thwarted their plan, they withdrew
and we all went back to the wall, each one to his work.

Neh 4:10 From then on, half my own retainers went on working, while the other half stood by, armed with
spears, shields, bows and armour to protect the whole House of Judah as they rebuilt the wall.

Neh 4:1 1 The carriers were armed, working with one hand and holding a spear in the other.

Neh 4:12 Each builder had his sword strapped to his side as he built. Beside me stood a trumpeter.

Neh 4:13 I then said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, “The work is great and widely spread
out, and we are deployed along the wall some way from one another.

Neh 4:14 Rally to us wherever you hear the trumpet sounding; our God will fight for us”.

Neh 4:15 And so we went on with the work from break of day until the stars came out.

Neh 4:16 At the same time I also told the people, “Let every man, with his attendant, spend the night inside
Jerusalem; we shall spend the night on guard and the day at work”.

Neh 4:17 Neither I, nor my brothers, nor my attendants, nor my bodyguards, ever took off our clothes; each one
kept his spear in his right hand.

Neh 5:1 There was a great outcry from the people, and from their wives, against their brother Jews.

Neh 5:2 Some said, “We are having to pledge our sons and daughters to get enough grain to eat and keep us
alive”.

Neh 5:3 Others said, “We are having to mortgage our fields, our vineyards and our houses to get grain because
of the shortage”.

Neh 5:4 Still others said, “We have had to borrow money on our fields and our vineyards to pay the royal tax;
Neh 5:5 and though we belong to the same race as our brothers, and our children are as good as theirs, we
shall have to sell our sons and our daughters into slavery; some of our daughters have been sold into slavery



already. We can do nothing about it, since our fields and our vineyards now belong to others”.

Neh 5:6 When I heard their complaints and these words I was very angry.

Neh 5:7 Having turned the matter over in my mind, I reprimanded the nobles and the officials as follows, “Each
of you is imposing a burden on his brother”. Summoning a great assembly to deal with them,

Neh 5:8 I said to them, “To the best of our power, we have redeemed our brother Jews who were forced to sell
themselves to foreigners, and now you in turn are selling your brothers, for them to be bought back by us!”. They
were silent and could find nothing to say.

Neh 5:9 “What you are doing”, I went on, “is wrong. Do you not want to walk in the fear of our God and escape
the sneers of the nations, our enemies?

Neh 5:10 I too, with my brothers and retainers, have lent them money and grain. Let us cancel these pledges.
Neh 5:1 1 This very day return them their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves and their houses, and cancel
the claim on the money, grain, new wine and olive oil, which you have lent them”.

Neh 5:12 “We shall make restitution”, they replied, “we shall claim nothing more from them; we shall do as you
say”. Summoning the priests, I then made them swear to do as they had promised.

Neh 5:13 Then, shaking out the fold of my garment, I said, “May God thus shake out of house and possessions
anyone who does not make good this promise; may he be shaken out thus and left empty!”. And the whole
assembly answered, “Amen” and praised Yahweh. And the people kept this promise.

Neh 5:14 What is more, from the time when the king appointed me to be their governor in Judah, from the
twentieth to the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, for twelve years, neither I nor my brothers ever levied the
governor’s subsistence allowance,

Neh 5:15 whereäs the former governors, my predecessors, had been a burden on the people, from whom they
took forty silver shekels a day for food and wine, while their attendants oppressed the people too. But I, fearing
God, never did this.

Neh 5:16 Also, not acquiring any land, I concentrated on the work of this wall and all my attendants joined in the
work together, too.

Neh 5:17 Furthermore, magistrates and officials to the number of a hundred and fifty ate at my table, not to
mention those who came to us from the surrounding nations.

Neh 5:18 Every day, one ox, six fine sheep, as well as poultry, were prepared for me; every ten days, skins of
wine were brought in bulk. But even so, I never claimed the governor’s subsistence allowance, since the people
already had burden enough to bear.

Neh 5:19 To my credit, my God, remember all I have done for this people.

Neh 6:1 When Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab and our other enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall and
that not a single gap was left — though at that time I had not fixed the doors to the gates-

Neh 6:2 Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message, “Come and meet us at Ha-Chephirim in the Vale of Ono”.
But they had evil designs on me.

Neh 6:3 So I sent messengers to them to say, “I am engaged in a great undertaking, so I cannot come down.
Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?”.

Neh 6:4 Four times they sent me the same invitation and I made them the same reply.

Neh 6:5 The fifth time, with the same purpose in mind, Sanballat sent me his servant bearing an open letter.

Neh 6:6 It ran, “There is a rumour among the nations — and Gashmu confirms it — that you and the Jews are
thinking of rebelling, which is why you are rebuilding the wall, and you intend to become their king;

Neh 6:7 and that you have even briefed prophets to acclaim you in Jerusalem with the cry, ‘There is a king in
Judah!’. Now, these rumours are going to reach the king; so you had better come and discuss them with us”.

Neh 6:8 To this I sent him the following reply, “As regards what you say, nothing of the sort has occurred; it is a
figment of your own imagination”.

Neh 6:9 For they were all trying to terrorise us, thinking, “They will become demoralised over the work and it will
not get finished”. But my morale rose even higher.

Neh 6:10 Then, when I went to visit Shemaiah son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, since he was prevented from
coming to me, he said: We must gather at the Temple of God, inside the sanctuary itself; we must shut the
sanctuary doors, for they are coming to kill you, they are coming to kill you tonight!

Neh 6:1 1 But I retorted, “Should a man like me run away? Would a man like me go into the Temple to save his
life? I shall not go in!”.

Neh 6:12 I realised that God had not sent him to say this, but that he had produced this prophecy for me
because Tobiah was paying him

Neh 6:13 to terrorise me into doing as he said and committing a sin, so that they would have grounds for
blackening my reputation and blaming me.

Neh 6:14 Remember Tobiah, my God, for what he did; and Noadiah the prophetess, and the other prophets
who tried to terrorise me.

Neh 6:15 The wall was finished within fifty-two days, on the twenty-fifth of Elul.



Neh 6:16 When all our enemies heard about it and all the surrounding nations saw it, they thought it a wonderful
thing, because they realised that this work had been accomplished by the power of our God.

Neh 6:17 During this same period, the nobles of Judah kept sending letter after letter to Tobiah, and letters from
Tobiah kept arriving for them;

Neh 6:18 for he had many sworn to his interest in Judah, since he was son-in-law to Shecaniah son of Arah,
and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah.

Neh 6:19 They even cried up his good deeds in my presence, and they reported what I said back to him. And
Tobiah kept sending letters to terrorise me.

Neh 7:1 Now, when the wall had been rebuilt and I had hung the doors, the gatekeepers (the singers and the
Levites) were then appointed.

Neh 7:2 I entrusted the administration of Jerusalem to my brother Hanani, and to Hananiah the commander of
the citadel, for he was a more trustworthy, God-fearing man than many others.

Neh 7:3 I said to them, “The gates of Jerusalem must not be opened until the sun gets hot; and the doors must
be shut and barred before it begins to go down. Detail guards from the residents of Jerusalem, each to his post,
in front of his own house”.

Neh 7:4 The city was large and spacious but the population was small, and the houses had not been rebuilt.

Neh 7:5 My God then inspired me to assemble the nobles, the officials and the people for the purpose of taking
a census by families. I discovered the genealogical register of those who had returned in the first group, and
there I found entered:

Neh 7:6 These are the people of the province who returned from the captivity of the Exile, those whom
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had deported, and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own
town.

Neh 7:7 They were the ones who arrived with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani,
Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:

Neh 7:8 sons of Parosh, two thousand one hundred and seventy-two;

Neh 7:9 sons of Shephatiah, three hundred and seventy-two;

Neh 7:10 sons of Arah, six hundred and fifty-two;

Neh 7:25 sons of Gibeon, ninety-five;

Neh 7:26 men of Bethlehem and Netophah, one hundred and eighty-eight;

Neh 7:27 men of Anathoth, one hundred and twenty-eight;

Neh 7:28 men of Beth-Azmaveth, forty-two;

Neh 7:29 men of Kiriath-Jearim, Chephirah and Beeroth, seven hundred and forty-three;

Neh 7:30 men of Ramah and Geba, six hundred and twenty-one;

Neh 7:31 men of Michmas, one hundred and twenty-two;

Neh 7:32 men of Bethel and Ai, one hundred and twenty-three;

Neh 7:33 men of the other Nebo, fifty-two;

Neh 7:34 sons of the other Elam, one thousand two hundred and fifty-four;

Neh 7:35 sons of Harim, three hundred and twenty;

Neh 7:36 sons of Jericho, three hundred and forty-five;

Neh 7:37 sons of Lod, Hadid and Ono, seven hundred and twenty-one;

Neh 7:38 sons of Senaah, three thousand nine hundred and thirty.

Neh 7:39 The priests: sons of Jedaiah, of the House of Jeshua, nine hundred and seventy-three;

Neh 7:40 sons of Immer, one thousand and fifty-two;

Neh 7:41 sons of Pashhur, one thousand two hundred and forty-seven;



Neh 7:42 sons of Harim, one thousand and seventeen.

Neh 7:43 The Levites: sons of Jeshua, of Kadmiel, of the sons of Hodiah, seventy-four.

Neh 7:44 The singers: sons of Asaph, one hundred and forty-eight.

Neh 7:45 The gatekeepers: sons of Shallum, sons of Ater, sons of Talmon, sons of Akkub, sons of Hatita, sons
of Shobai, one hundred and thirty-eight.

Neh 7:46 The temple slaves: sons of Ziha, sons of Hasupha, sons of Tabbaoth,

Neh 7:47 sons of Keros, sons of Sia, sons of Padon,

Neh 7:48 sons of Lebana, sons of Hagaba, sons of Shalmai,

Neh 7:49 sons of Hanan, sons of Giddel, sons of Gahar,

Neh 7:50 sons of Reaiah, sons of Rezin, sons of Nekoda,

Neh 7:51 sons of Gazzam, sons of Uzza, sons of Paseah,

Neh 7:52 sons of Besai, sons of the Meunites, sons of the Nephusites,

Neh 7:53 sons of Bakbuk, sons of Hakupha, sons of Harhur,

Neh 7:54 sons of Bazlith, sons of Mehida, sons of Harsha,

Neh 7:55 sons of Barkos, sons of Sisera, sons of Temah,

Neh 7:56 sons of Nezaiah, sons of Hatipha.

Neh 7:57 The sons of Solomon’s slaves: sons of Sotai, sons of Sophereth, sons of Perida,

Neh 7:58 sons of Jaala, sons of Darkon, sons of Giddel,

Neh 7:59 sons of Shephatiah, sons of Hattil, sons of Pochereth-ha-Zebaim, sons of Amon.

Neh 7:60 The total of the temple slaves and the sons of Solomon’s slaves: three hundred and ninety-two.

Neh 7:61 The following, who came from Tel-Melah, Tel-Harsha, Cherub, Addon and Immer, could not prove that
their families and ancestry were of Israelite origin:

Neh 7:62 the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda: six hundred and forty-two.

Neh 7:63 And among the priests: the sons of Hobaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, the sons of Barzillai — who had
married one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, whose name he adopted.

Neh 7:64 These had looked for their entries in the official genealogies but were not to be found there, and were
hence disqualified from the priesthood.

Neh 7:65 Consequently, His Excellency forbade them to eat any of the consecrated food until a priest appeared
who could consult urim and thummim.

Neh 7:66 The whole assembly numbered forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty people,

Neh 7:67 not counting their slaves and maidservants to the number of seven thousand three hundred and thirty-
seven. They also had two hundred and forty-five male and female singers.

Neh 7:68 They had four hundred and thirty-five camels and six thousand seven hundred and twenty donkeys.
Neh 7:69 A certain number of heads of families contributed to the work. His Excellency contributed one
thousand gold drachmas, fifty bowls, and thirty priestly robes to the fund.

Neh 7:70 And heads of families gave twenty thousand gold drachmas and two thousand two hundred silver
minas to the work fund.

Neh 7:71 The gifts made by the rest of the people amounted to twenty thousand gold drachmas, two thousand
silver minas, and sixty-seven priestly robes.

Neh 7:72 The priests, the Levites and some of the people lived in Jerusalem and thereabouts; the singers, the
gatekeepers, and the temple slaves in their appropriate towns; and all the other Israelites, in their own towns.
Now when the seventh month came round — the Israelites being in their towns-

Neh 8:1 all the people gathered as one man in the square in front of the Water Gate, and asked the scribe Ezra
to bring the Book of the Law of Moses which Yahweh had prescribed for Israel.

Neh 8:2 Accordingly, on the first day of the seventh month, the priest Ezra brought the Law before the
assembly, consisting of men, women and all those old enough to understand.

Neh 8:3 In the square in front of the Water Gate, in the presence of the men and women, and of those old
enough to understand, he read from the book from dawn till noon; all the people listened attentively to the Book
of the Law.

Neh 8:4 The scribe Ezra stood on a wooden dais erected for the purpose; beside him stood, on his right,
Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah and Maaseiah; on his left, Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum,
Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam.

Neh 8:5 In full view of all the people — since he stood higher than them all — Ezra opened the book; and when
he opened it, all the people stood up.

Neh 8:6 Then Ezra blessed Yahweh, the great God, and all the people raised their hands and answered, “Amen!
Amen!”; then they bowed down and, face to the ground, prostrated themselves before Yahweh.

Neh 8:7 And Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabab,
Hanan, Pelaiah, who were Levites, explained the Law to the people, while the people all kept their places.

Neh 8:8 Ezra read from the book of the Law of God, translating and giving the sense; so the reading was



understood,

Neh 8:9 Then His Excellency Nehemiah and the priest-scribe Ezra and the Levites who were instructing the
people said to all the people, “Today is sacred to Yahweh your God. Do not be mournful, do not weep”. For the
people were all in tears as they listened to the words of the Law.

Neh 8:10 He then said, “You may go; eat what is rich, drink what is sweet and send a helping to the man who
has nothing prepared. For today is sacred to our Lord. Do not be sad: the joy of Yahweh is your stronghold”.

Neh 8:1 1 And the Levites calmed all the people down, saying, “Keep quiet; this is a sacred day. Do not be sad”.
Neh 8:12 Then all the people went off to eat and drink and give helpings away and enjoy themselves to the full,
since they had understood the meaning of what had been proclaimed to them.

Neh 8:13 On the second day, the heads of families of the whole people, and the priests and Levites, gathered
round the scribe Ezra to study the words of the Law.

Neh 8:14 And written in the Law that Yahweh had prescribed through Moses they found that the Israelites were
to live in shelters during the feast of the seventh month.

Neh 8:15 So they issued a proclamation and had it circulated in all their towns and in Jerusalem: “Go into the
hills and bring branches of olive, pine, myrtle, palm and other leafy trees to make shelters, as it says in the book”.
Neh 8:16 The people went out; they brought branches and made shelters for themselves, each man on his roof,
in their courtyards, in the precincts of the Temple of God, in the square of the Water Gate and in the square of
the Ephraim Gate.

Neh 8:17 The whole assembly, all who had returned from the captivity, put up shelters and lived in them; this
the Israelites had not done from the days of Joshua son of Nun till that day, and there was very great
merrymaking.

Neh 8:18 Each day, from the first day to the last one, Ezra read from the Book of the Law of God. They
celebrated the feast for seven days; on the eighth day, as prescribed, they held a solemn assembly.

Neh 9:1 On the twenty-fourth day of this month the Israelites, in sackcloth and with dust on their heads,
assembled for a fast.

Neh 9:2 Then those of Israelite stock who had severed relations with all foreigners stood up and confessed their
sins and the iniquities of their ancestors.

Neh 9:3 Standing, each man in his place, they read from the Book of the Law of Yahweh their God for one
quarter of the day; for another quarter they confessed their sins and worshipped Yahweh their God.

Neh 9:4 On the Levites’ platform stood Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani and
Chenani, calling to Yahweh their God in ringing tones.

Neh 9:5 The Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah and Pethahiah said,
“Stand up and bless Yahweh your God! “Blessed are you, Yahweh our God from everlasting to everlasting, and
blessed be your glorious name, surpassing all blessing and praise!

Neh 9:6 “You, Yahweh, are the one, only Yahweh, you have created the heavens, the heaven of heavens and
all their array, the earth and all it bears, the seas and all they hold. To all of them you give life, and the array of
heaven worships you.

Neh 9:7 “You are Yahweh God, who chose Abram, brought him out of Ur in Chaldaea and changed his name to
Abraham.

Neh 9:8 Finding his heart was faithful to you, you made a covenant with him, to give the country of the
Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites and the Girgashites to him and his
descendants. And you have made good your promises, for you are upright.

Neh 9:9 “You saw the distress of our ancestors in Egypt, you heard their cry by the Sea of Reeds.

Neh 9:10 You displayed signs and wonders against Pharaoh, against all his servants and all the people of his
land; for you knew how arrogantly they treated them. You won a reputation which you keep to this day.

Neh 9:1 1 You opened up the sea in front of them: they walked on dry ground right through the sea. Into the
depths you hurled their pursuers like a stone into the raging waters.

Neh 9:12 With a pillar of cloud you led them by day, with a pillar of fire by night: to light the way ahead of them
by which they were to go.

Neh 9:13 You came down on Mount Sinai and spoke with them from heaven; you gave them right rules, reliable
laws, good statutes and commandments;

Neh 9:14 you revealed your holy Sabbath to them; you laid down commandments, statutes and law for them
through your servant Moses.

Neh 9:15 For their hunger you gave them bread from heaven, for their thirst you brought them water out of a
rock, and you told them to go in and take possession of the country which you had sworn to give them.

Neh 9:16 “But they and our ancestors acted arrogantly, grew obstinate and flouted your commands.

Neh 9:17 They refused to obey, forgetful of the wonders which you had worked for them; they grew obstinate
and made up their minds to return to their slavery in Egypt. But because you are a forgiving God, gracious and
compassionate, patient and rich in faithful love, you did not abandon them!



Neh 9:18 “Even when they cast themselves a calf out of molten metal and said, ‘This is your God who brought
you up from Egypt!’. and committed monstrous impieties,

Neh 9:19 you, in your great compassion, did not abandon them in the desert: the pillar of cloud did not leave
them, leading them on their path by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, lighting the way ahead of them by which
they were to go.

Neh 9:20 You gave them your good spirit to instruct them, you did not withhold your manna from their mouths,
you gave them water for their thirst.

Neh 9:21 For forty years you cared for them in the desert, so that they went short of nothing, their clothes did
not wear out, nor were their feet swollen.

Neh 9:22 “You gave them kingdoms and peoples, allotting them these as frontier lands; they occupied the
country of Sihon king of Heshbon, and the country of Og king of Bashan.

Neh 9:23 You gave them as many children as there are stars in the sky, and brought them into the country
which you had promised their ancestors that they would enter and possess.

Neh 9:24 The children entered and took possession of the country and before them you subdued the country’s
inhabitants, the Canaanites, whom you put at their mercy, with their kings and the peoples of the country, for
them to treat as they pleased;

Neh 9:25 they captured fortified towns and a fertile countryside, they took possession of houses stocked with all
kinds of goods, of storage-wells ready-hewn, of vineyards, olive groves and fruit trees in profusion; so they ate,
were full, grew fat and revelled in your great goodness.

Neh 9:26 “But they grew disobedient, rebelled against you and thrust your law behind their backs; they
slaughtered your prophets who had reproved them to bring them back to you, and committed monstrous
impieties.

Neh 9:27 So you put them at the mercy of their enemies who oppressed them. But when they were being
oppressed and called to you, you heard them from heaven and because of your great compassion you gave
them deliverers who rescued them from their oppressors’ clutches.

Neh 9:28 But once at peace again, again they did what was wrong before you; so you put them at the mercy of
their enemies who then became their rulers. When they called to you again, you heard them from heaven and,
because of your compassion, rescued them many times.

Neh 9:29 You warned them, to bring them back to your law, but they became arrogant, did not obey your
commandments and sinned against your rules, in whose observance is life; they turned a stubborn shoulder,
were obstinate, and disobeyed.

Neh 9:30 You were patient with them for many years and warned them by your spirit through your prophets, but
they would not listen; so you put them at the mercy of the people of the country.

Neh 9:31 But, because of your great compassion, you did not destroy them completely nor abandon them, for
you are a gracious, compassionate God.

Neh 9:32 Now, our God — the great God, the Mighty and Awe-inspiring One, maintaining the covenant and your
faithful love- count as no small thing this misery which has befallen us, our kings, our princes, our priests, our
prophets, and all your people from the times of the Assyrian kings to the present day.

Neh 9:33 You have been upright in all that has happened to us, for you acted faithfully, while we did wrong.

Neh 9:34 Our kings, our princes, our priests and our ancestors did not keep your law or pay attention to your
commandments and obligations which you imposed upon them.

Neh 9:35 Even in their own kingdom, despite your great goodness which you bestowed on them, despite the
wide and fertile country which you had lavished on them, they did not serve you or renounce their evil deeds.
Neh 9:36 See, we are slaves today, slaves in the country which you gave to our ancestors for them to eat the
good things it produces.

Neh 9:37 Its abundant produce goes to the kings whom, for our sins, you have set over us, who rule over our
persons and over our cattle as they please. We are in great distress”.

Neh 10:1 In view of all this we make a firm agreement, in writing. Our princes, our Levites, our priests and the
rest of the people have put their names to the document under seal.

Neh 10:2 On the sealed document were the names of: Nehemiah, son of Hacaliah, and Zedekiah;

Neh 10:3 Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah,

Neh 10:4 Pashhur, Amariah, Malchijah,

Neh 10:5 Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch,

Neh 10:6 Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah,

Neh 10:7 Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch,

Neh 10:8 Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin,

Neh 10:9 Maaziah, Bilgai, Shemaiah: these were the priests.

Neh 10:10 The Levites were: Jeshua son of Azaniah, Binnui of the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel,

Neh 10:1 1 and their kinsmen Shebaniah, Hodaviah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan,



Neh 10:12 Mica, Rehob, Hashabiah,

Neh 10:13 Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah,

Neh 10:14 Hodiah, Bani, Chenani.

Neh 10:15 The leaders of the people were: Parosh, Pahath-Moab, Elam, Zattu, Bani,

Neh 10:16 Bunni, Azgad, Bebai,

Neh 10:17 Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin,

Neh 10:18 Ater, Hezekiah, Azzur,

Neh 10:19 Hodiah, Hashum, Bezai,

Neh 10:29 And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the temple slaves
and all those who had severed relations with the people of the country to adhere to the law of God, as also their
wives, their sons, their daughters, that is, all those who had reached the age of discretion,

Neh 1 0:30 have joined their esteemed brothers in a solemn oath to follow the law of God given through Moses,
servant of God, and to observe and practise all the commandments of Yahweh our Lord, with his rules and his
statutes.

Neh 1 0:31 We will not give our daughters in marriage to the peoples of the country, nor allow their daughters to
marry our sons.

Neh 1 0:32 If the people of the country bring goods or foodstuff of any kind to sell on the Sabbath day, we will
buy nothing from them on Sabbath or holy day. In the seventh year, we will forgo the produce of the soil and the
exaction of all debts.

Neh 10:33 We recognise the following obligations: to give one-third of a shekel yearly for the service of the
Temple of our God:

Neh 10:34 for the loaves of permanent offering, for the perpetual oblation, for the perpetual burnt offering, for
the sacrifices on Sabbaths, on New Moons and on festivals, for the consecrated gifts, the sin offerings to expiate
for Israel, in short, for the whole work of the Temple of our God;

Neh 1 0:35 Furthermore, as regards deliveries of wood for burning on the altar of our God as the law prescribes,
we have arranged, by drawing lots, how these deliveries are to be made at the Temple of our God by the priests,
the Levites and the people by families, at stated times every year. We will no longer neglect the Temple of our
God.

Neh 10:36 and further, to bring yearly to the Temple of our God the first-fruits of our soil and the first-fruits of all
our orchards,

Neh 10:37 also the first-born of our sons and of our cattle, as the law prescribes, the first-born of our herds and
flocks should be taken to the Temple of our God for the priests officiating in the Temple of our God.

Neh 1 0:38 Furthermore, we shall bring the best of our dough, of every kind of fruit, of the new wine and of the oil
to the priests, to the storerooms of the Temple of our God, and the tithe on our soil to the Levites — the Levites
will themselves collect the tithes from all the towns of our religion.

Neh 10:39 An Aaronite priest will accompany the Levites when they collect the tithes, and the Levites will bring
a tenth part

Neh 10:40 a, b of the tithes to the Temple of our God, into the treasury storerooms; for these rooms are where
the Israelites and the Levites are to bring the contributions of corn, wine and oil, and where the vessels of the
sanctuary are, and the officiating priests, the gatekeepers and the singers.

Neh 11:1 Now the leaders of the people took up residence in Jerusalem; so the rest of the people drew lots: one
man in ten was to come and live in Jerusalem, the holy city, while the other nine were to stay in the towns
outside.

Neh 1 1 :2 The people praised all those who volunteered to live in Jerusalem.

Neh 11:3 In the towns of Judah each man lived on his own property, but these are the provincial leaders, the
Israelites, the priests, the Levites, the temple slaves and the descendants of Solomon’s slaves, who made their
homes in Jerusalem:

Neh 1 1 :4 Of the sons of Judah and the sons of Benjamin who made their homes in Jerusalem there were: Of
the sons of Judah: Athaiah son of Uzziah, son of Zechariah, son of Amariah, son of Shephatiah, son of
Mehalalel, of the descendants of Perez;



Neh 1 1 :5 and Maaseiah son of Baruch, son of Col-Hozeh, son of Hazaiah, son of Adaiah, son of Joiarib, son of
Zechariah, descendant of Shelah.

Neh 1 1 :6 The total number of the descendants of Perez living in Jerusalem was four hundred and sixty-eight
outstanding people.

Neh 1 1 :7 These are the sons of Benjamin: Sallu son of Meshullam, son of Joed, son of Pedaiah, son of Kolaiah,
son of Maaseiah, son of Ithiel, son of Jeshaiah,

Neh 1 1 :8 and his brothers Gabbai and Sallai; nine hundred and twenty-eight.

Neh 1 1 :9 Joel son of Zichri was their chief, and Judah son of Hassenuah was second in command of the city.
Neh 11:10 Of the priests there were Jedaiah son of Joiakim, son of

Neh 11:11 Seraiah, son of Hilkiah, son of Meshullam, son ofZadok, son of Meraioth, son of Ahitub, the chief of
the Temple of God,

Neh 11:12 and their kinsmen who performed the Temple liturgy: eight hundred and twenty-two; Adaiah son of
Jeroham, son of Pelaliah, son of Amzi, son of Zechariah, son of Pashhur, son of Malchijah,

Neh 11:13 and his kinsfolk, heads of families: two hundred and forty-two; and Amashai son of Azarel, son of
Ahzai, son of Meshillemoth, son of Immer,

Neh 1 1:14 and his kinsfolk, outstanding people: one hundred and twenty-eight. Their chief was Zabdiel son of
Haggadol.

Neh 11:15 Of the Levites there were Shemaiah son of Hasshub, son of Azrikam, son of Hashabiah, son of
Bunni;

Neh 11:16 Shabbethai and Jozabad, the levitical leaders responsible for work outside the Temple of God;

Neh 11:17 Mattaniah son of Mica, son of Zabdi, son of Asaph, who led the praises and intoned the thanksgiving
associated with the prayer, Bakbukiah being his junior colleague; and Obadiah son of Shammua, son of Galal,
son of Jeduthun.

Neh 11:18 The total number of Levites in the holy city was two hundred and eighty-four.

Neh 11:19 The gatekeepers: Akkub, Talmon and their kinsmen, who kept watch at the gates: one hundred and
seventy-two.

Neh 1 1 :20 The rest of Israel, including the priests and Levites, made their homes throughout the towns of
Judah, each man on his own inheritance,

Neh 1 1 :21 The temple slaves lived on Ophel; Ziha and Gishpa were in charge of the temple slaves.

Neh 1 1 :22 The official in charge of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi son of Bani, son of Hashabiah, son of
Mattaniah, son of Mica, of the sons of Asaph, who led the singing in the liturgy of the Temple of God;

Neh 1 1 :23 for the singers were under royal orders, with regulations laying down what was required of them day
by day.

Neh 1 1 :24 Petahiah son of Meshezabel, of the sons of Zerah son of Judah, was the king’s minister for all
matters connected with the people.

Neh 1 1 :25 and in the villages near their lands. Some of the sons of Judah made their homes in Kiriath-Arba and
its dependencies, Dibon and its dependencies, Jekabzeel and its dependencies,

Neh 11:26 Jeshua, Moladah, Beth-Pelet,

Neh 1 1 .21 Hazar-Shual, Beersheba and its dependencies,

Neh 11:28 Ziklag, Meconah and its dependencies,

Neh 1 1 :29 En-Rimmon, Zorah, Jarmuth,

Neh 1 1 :30 Zanoah, Adullam and their villages, Lachish and its lands, and Azekah and its dependencies; thus,
they settled from Beersheba as far as the Valley of Hinnom.

Neh 1 1 :31 And some Benjaminites made their homes in Geba, Michmash, Aija, Bethel and its dependencies,
Neh 11:32 Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah,

Neh 11:33 Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim,

Neh 11:34 Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat,

Neh 1 1 :35 Lod, Ono and the Valley of Craftsmen.

Neh 1 1 :36 Some levitical groups lived in Judah, some in Benjamin.

Neh 12:1 These are the priests and the Levites who came back with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua:
Neh 12:2 Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,

Neh 12:3 Amariah, Malluch, Hattush, Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,

Neh 12:4 Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah,

Neh 12:5 Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,

Neh 12:6 Shemaiah, and Joiarib, Jedaiah,

Neh 1 2:7 Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah — these were the heads of the priests and their kinsmen in the days of
Jeshua.

Neh 12:8 The Levites were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, Mattaniah — this last, with his brothers,
was in charge of the songs of praise,



Neh 12:9 while Bakbukiah and Unno, their colleagues, formed the alternate choir to theirs.

Neh 12:10 Jeshua fathered Joiakim, Joiakim fathered Eliashib, Eliashib fathered Joiada,

Neh 12:1 1 Joiada fathered Johanan, and Johanan fathered Jaddua.

Neh 12:12 In the days of Joiakim the heads of the priestly families were: family of Seraiah, Meraiah; of
Jeremiah, Hananiah;

Neh 12:13 of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;

Neh 12:14 of Malluch, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;

Neh 12:15 of Harim, Adna; of Meremoth, Helkai;

Neh 12:16 of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;

Neh 12:17 of Abijah, Zichri; of Minjamin, . . of Moadiah, Piltai;

Neh 12:18 ofBilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan;

Neh 12:19 and of Jojarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;

Neh 12:20 of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;

Neh 12:21 of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel.

Neh 12:22 In the time of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan and Jaddua, the heads of the families of priests were
registered in the Book of Chronicles, up to the reign of Darius the Persian.

Neh 12:23 The Levites who were heads of families were registered in the Book of Chronicles up to the time of
Johanan, grandson of Eliashib.

Neh 12:24 The heads of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, while their brothers
who formed an alternate choir for the hymns of praise and thanksgiving, as David, man of God, had prescribed,
section corresponding to section,

Neh 12:25 were Mattaniah, Bakbukiah and Obadiah. Meshullam, Talmon and Akkub were the gatekeepers
guarding the stores at the gates.

Neh 1 2:26 These lived in the days of Joiakim son of Jeshua, son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the
governor and of Ezra the priest-scribe.

Neh 1 2:27 At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem the Levites were sent for, wherever they lived, to come to
Jerusalem and joyfully perform the dedication with hymns of thanksgiving and songs to the accompaniment of
cymbals, lyres and harps.

Neh 12:28 Accordingly, the levitical singers assembled from the district round Jerusalem, from the villages of
the Netophathites,

Neh 1 2:29 from Beth-Gilgal and from their farms at Geba and Azmaveth — for the singers had built themselves
villages all round Jerusalem.

Neh 12:30 When the priests and Levites had purified themselves, they then purified the people, the gates and
the wall.

Neh 1 2:31 I then made the leaders of Judah come on to the top of the wall and appointed two large choirs. One
made its way along the top of the wall, to the right, towards the Dung Gate;

Neh 1 2:32 bringing up the rear were Hoshaiah and half the leaders of Judah,

Neh 12:33 and also Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,

Neh 12:34 Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah and Jeremiah,

Neh 12:35 of the priests, with trumpets; then Zechariah son of Jonathan, son of Shemaiah, son of Mattaniah,
son of Micaiah, son of Zaccur, son of Asaph,

Neh 12:36 with his kinsmen, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Juda, Hanani, with the musical
instruments of David, man of God. The scribe Ezra walked at their head.

Neh 12:37 At the Fountain Gate they went straight on up the steps of the City of David, along the top of the
rampart by the stairway of the wall, above the Palace of David as far as the Water Gate, on the east.

Neh 12:38 The other choir made its way to the left; I and half the leaders of the people followed them along the
top of the wall from the Tower of the Furnaces to the Broad Wall,

Neh 12:39 from the Ephraim Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred as far as
the Sheep Gate, and they came to a halt at the Prison Gate.

Neh 12:40 The two choirs then took their places in the Temple of God. But I had half the magistrates with me
Neh 12:41 as well as the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, Hananiah with the
trumpets,

Neh 12:42 and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam and Ezer. The singers sang
loudly under the direction of Jezrahiah.

Neh 12:43 There were great sacrifices offered that day and the people rejoiced, God having given them good
cause for rejoicing; the women and children rejoiced too, and the joy of Jerusalem could be heard from far away.
Neh 12:44 For the rooms intended for the treasures, contributions, first-fruits and tithes, supervisors were then
appointed whose business it was to collect in them those portions from the town lands awarded by the Law to
the priests and Levites. For Judah rejoiced in the officiating priests and Levites,



Neh 12:45 since they — with the singers and gatekeepers — performed the liturgy of their God and the rites of
purification as ordained by David and his son Solomon.

Neh 1 2:46 For from ancient times, from the days of David and Asaph, they had been the leaders in rendering
hymns of praise and thanksgiving to God.

Neh 1 2:47 In the days of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah, all Israel supplied regular daily portions for the singers and
gatekeepers, and gave the dedicated contributions to the Levites; and the Levites gave the dedicated
contributions to the Aaronites.

Neh 13:1 At that time they were reading to the people from the Book of Moses, when they found this written in it,
“No Ammonite or Moabite is to be admitted to the assembly of God, and this is for all time,

Neh 13:2 since they did not come to meet the Israelites with bread and water, and even hired Balaam to oppose
them by cursing them; but our God turned the curse into a blessing”.

Neh 13:3 Having heard the Law, they excluded all foreigners from Israel.

Neh 13:4 Earlier, Eliashib the priest, who was in charge of the rooms of the Temple of our God, and who was
close to Tobiah,

Neh 13:5 had provided him with a large room where they previously used to store the meal offerings, incense,
utensils, tithes of corn, wine and oil, that is, the part of the Levites, singers and gatekeepers, and the
contributions for the priests.

Neh 13:6 While all this was going on I was away from Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king
of Babylon I had gone to see the king. But after some time I asked the king for permission to leave,

Neh 13:7 and returned to Jerusalem, where I learned about the crime which Eliashib had committed for Tobiah’s
benefit, by providing him with a room in the courts of the Temple of God.

Neh 13:8 I was extremely displeased and threw all Tobiah’s household goods out of the room and into the
street.

Neh 13:9 I then gave orders for the room to be purified, and had the utensils of the Temple of God, the meal
offerings and the incense, all replaced.

Neh 13:10 I also learned that the Levites had not been receiving their allocations, as a result of which the
Levites and singers who performed the liturgy had all withdrawn to their farms.

Neh 13:1 1 I then reprimanded the officials. “Why is the Temple of God deserted?”. I asked. And I collected them
together again and brought them back to their posts;

Neh 13:12 and all Judah then delivered the tithe of corn, wine and oil to the storehouses.

Neh 13:13 As supervisors of the storehouses I appointed Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, Pedaiah one
of the Levites and, as their assistant, Hanan son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah, since they were considered
reliable people; their duty was to make the distributions to their kinsmen.

Neh 13:14 Remember me for this, my God, and do not blot out the good deeds which I have done for the
Temple of my God and its observances!

Neh 13:15 At the same time I saw people in Judah treading the winepress, bringing in sacks of grain and
loading donkeys on the Sabbath; they were also bringing wine, grapes, figs and every kind of merchandise into
Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. So I forbade them to sell the food.

Neh 13:16 Tyrians living there were bringing in fish and every kind of merchandise which they were selling to
the Judaeans on the Sabbath in Jerusalem itself.

Neh 13:17 So I also reprimanded the leading men of Judah, saying to them, “What a wicked way to behave,
profaning the Sabbath day!

Neh 13:18 Was this not exactly what your ancestors did, with the result that our God brought all this misery
down on us and on this city? And now you are adding to the wrath hanging over Israel by profaning the Sabbath
yourselves!”.

Neh 13:19 So when the gates of Jerusalem were getting dark at the approach of the Sabbath, I gave orders for
the doors to be shut and directed that they were not to be opened again until the Sabbath was over. I stationed
some of my attendants at the gates to make sure that no merchandise was brought in on the Sabbath day.

Neh 13:20 So the traders and dealers in goods of all kinds spent the night outside Jerusalem once or twice,

Neh 13:21 until I reprimanded them. I said to them, “Why are you spending the night in front of the wall? Do it
again, and I shall use force on you”. After this, they did not come on the Sabbath.

Neh 13:22 I then ordered the Levites to purify themselves and act as guards at the gates, so that the Sabbath
day might be kept holy. Remember this also to my credit, have pity on me in the greatness of your faithful love.
Neh 13:23 At that time too, I saw Jews who had married wives from Ashdod, Ammon and Moab;

Neh 1 3:24 as regards their children, half of them spoke the language of Ashdod or the language of one of the
other peoples, but could no longer speak the language of Judah.

Neh 13:25 I reprimanded them, I cursed them, I struck several of them and tore out their hair and adjured them
by God, “You are not to give your daughters in marriage to their sons or let their daughters marry your sons, or
marry them yourselves!



Neh 13:26 Was it not because of women like these that Solomon king of Israel sinned? Although among many
nations there was no king like him and he was loved by his God, and God made him king of all Israel, even then
foreign women led him into sinning!

Neh 13:27 Were you obedient when you committed this very grave crime: breaking faith with our God by
marrying foreign wives?”.

Neh 1 3:28 One of the sons of Jehoiada, son of Eliashib the high priest, was a son-in-law of Sanballat the
Horonite; I drove him from my presence.

Neh 1 3:29 Remember them, my God, for having defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priests and
Levites!

Neh 13:30 And so I purged them of everything foreign; I drew up regulations for the priests and Levites, defining
each man’s duty,

Neh 1 3:31 as well as for the deliveries of wood at the proper times, and for the first-fruits. Remember this, my
God, to my credit!

Tob 1:1 The tale of Tobit son of Tobiel, son of Ananiel, son of Aduel, son of Gabael, of the lineage of Asiel and
tribe of Naphtali.

Tob 1 :2 In the days of Shalmaneser king of Assyria, he was exiled from Thisbe, which is south of Kedesh-
Naphtali in Upper Galilee, above Hazor, some distance to the west, north of Shephat.

Tob 1 :3 I, Tobit, have walked in paths of truth and in good works all the days of my life. I have given much in
alms to my brothers and fellow country-folk, exiled like me to Nineveh in the country of Assyria.

Tob 1 :4 In my young days, when I was still at home in the land of Israel, the whole tribe of Naphtali my ancestor
broke away from the House of David and from Jerusalem, though this was the city chosen out of all the tribes of
Israel for their sacrifices; here, the Temple — God’s dwelling-place — had been built and hallowed for all
generations to come.

Tob 1 :5 All my brothers and the House of Naphtali sacrificed on every hill-top in Galilee to the calf that
Jeroboam king of Israel had made at Dan.

Tob 1 :6 Often I was quite alone in making the pilgrimage to Jerusalem, fulfilling the Law that binds all Israel
perpetually. I would hurry to Jerusalem with the first yield of fruits and beasts, the tithe of cattle and the sheep’s
first shearings.

Tob 1 :7 I would give these to the priests, the sons of Aaron, for the altar. To the Levites ministering at
Jerusalem I would give my tithe of wine and corn, olives, pomegranates and other fruits. Six years in succession
I took the second tithe in money and went and paid it annually at Jerusalem.

Tob 1 :8 I gave the third to orphans and widows and to the strangers who live among the Israelites; I brought it
them as a gift every three years. When we ate, we obeyed both the ordinances of the law of Moses and the
exhortations of Deborah the mother of our ancestor Ananiel; for my father had died and left me an orphan.

Tob 1 :9 When I came to man’s estate, I married a woman from our kinsfolk whose name was Anna; she bore
me a son whom I called Tobias.

Tob 1:10 When the banishment into Assyria came, I was taken away and went to Nineveh. All my brothers and
the people of my race ate the food of the heathen,

Tob 1:11 but for my part I was careful not to eat the food of the heathen.

Tob 1:12 And because I had kept faith with my God with my whole heart,

Tob 1:13 the Most High granted me the favour of Shalmaneser, and I became the king’s purveyor.

Tob 1:14 Until his death I used to travel to Media, where I transacted business on his behalf, and I deposited
sacks of silver worth ten talants with Gabael the brother of Gabrias at Rhages in Media.

Tob 1:15 On the death of Shalmaneser his son Sennacherib succeeded; the roads into Media were barred, and
I could no longer go there.

Tob 1:16 In the days of Shalmaneser I had often given alms to the people of my race;

Tob 1:17 I gave my bread to the hungry and clothes to those who lacked them; and I buried, when I saw them,
the bodies of my country-folk thrown over the walls of Nineveh.

Tob 1:18 I also buried those who were killed by Sennacherib. When Sennacherib was beating a disorderly
retreat from Judaea after the King of heaven had punished his blasphemies, he killed a great number of
Israelites in his rage. So I stole their bodies to bury them; Sennacherib looked for them and could not find them.
Tob 1:19 A Ninevite went and told the king it was I who had buried them secretly. When I knew that the king had
been told about me and saw myself being hunted by men who would put me to death, I was afraid and fled.

Tob 1 :20 All my goods were seized; they were all confiscated by the treasury; nothing was left me but my wife
Anna and my son Tobias.

Tob 1 :21 Less than forty days after this, the king was murdered by his two sons, who then fled to the mountains
of Ararat. His son Esarhaddon succeeded. Ahikar the son of my brother Anael, was appointed chancellor of the
exchequer for the kingdom and given the main ordering of affairs.

Tob 1 :22 Ahikar then interceded for me and I was allowed to return to Nineveh, since Ahikar had been chief



cupbearer, keeper of the signet, administrator and treasurer under Sennacherib king of Assyria, and Esarhaddon
had kept him in office. He was a relation of mine; he was my nephew.

Tob 2:1 In the reign of Esarhaddon, therefore, I returned home, and my wife Anna was restored to me with my
son Tobias. At our feast of Pentecost (the feast of Weeks) there was a good dinner. I took my place for the meal;
Tob 2:2 the table was brought to me and various dishes were brought. I then said to my son Tobias, “Go, my
child, and seek out some poor, loyal-hearted man among our brothers exiled in Nineveh, and bring him to share
my meal. I will wait until you come back, my child”.

Tob 2:3 So Tobias went out to look for some poor man among our brothers, but he came back again and said,
“Father!”. I replied, “What is it, my child?”. He went on, “Father, one of our nation has just been murdered; he has
been strangled and then thrown down in the market place; he is there still”.

Tob 2:4 I sprang up at once, left my meal untouched, took the man from the market place and laid him in one of
my rooms, waiting until sunset to bury him.

Tob 2:5 I came in again and washed myself and ate my bread in sorrow,

Tob 2:6 remembering the words of the prophet Amos concerning Bethel: I shall turn your festivals into mourning
and all your singing into lamentation.

Tob 2:7 And I wept. When the sun was down, I went and dug a grave and buried him.

Tob 2:8 My neighbours laughed and said, “See! He is not afraid any more”. (You must remember that a price
had been set on my head earlier for this very thing.) “Once before he had to flee, yet here he is, beginning to
bury the dead again”.

Tob 2:9 That night I took a bath; then I went into the courtyard and lay down by the courtyard wall. Since it was
hot I left my face uncovered.

Tob 2:10 I did not know that there were sparrows in the wall above my head; their hot droppings fell into my
eyes. This caused white spots to form, which I went to have treated by the doctors. But the more ointments they
tried me with, the more the spots blinded me, and in the end, I became completely blind. I remained without sight
four years; all my brothers were distressed on my behalf; and Ahikar provided for my upkeep for two years, until
he left for Elymais.

Tob 2:11 My wife Anna then undertook woman’s work; she would spin wool and take cloth to weave;

Tob 2:12 she used to deliver whatever had been ordered from her and then receive payment. Now on the
seventh day of the month of Dystros, she finished a piece of work and delivered it to her customers. They paid
her all that was due, and into the bargain presented her with a kid for a meal.

Tob 2:13 When the kid came into my house, it began to bleat. I called to my wife and said, “Where does this
creature come from? Suppose it has been stolen! Let the owners have it back; we have no right to eat stolen
goods”.

Tob 2:14 She said, “No, it was a present given me over and above my wages”. I did not believe her, and told her
to give it back to the owners (I felt deeply ashamed of her). To which, she replied, “What about your own alms?
What about your own good works? Everyone knows what return you have had for them”.

Tob 3:1 Then, sad at heart, I sighed and wept, and began this prayer of lamentation:

Tob 3:2 You are just, O Lord, and just are all your works. All your ways are grace and truth, and you are the
Judge of the world.

Tob 3:3 Therefore, Lord, remember me, look on me. Do not punish me for my sins or for my needless faults or
those of my ancestors.

Tob 3:4 For we have sinned against you and broken your commandments; and you have given us over to be
plundered, to captivity and death, to be the talk, the laughing-stock and scorn of all the nations among whom you
have dispersed us.

Tob 3:5 And now all your decrees are true when you deal with me as my faults deserve, and those of my
ancestors. For we have neither kept your commandments nor walked in truth before you.

Tob 3:6 So now, do with me as you will; be pleased to take my life from me; so that I may be delivered from
earth and become earth again. Better death than life for me, for I have endured groundless insult and am in
deepest sorrow. Lord, be pleased to deliver me from this affliction. Let me go away to my everlasting home; do
not turn your face from me, O Lord. Better death for me than life prolonged in the face of unrelenting misery: I
can no longer bear to listen to insults.

Tob 3:7 It chanced on the same day that Sarah the daughter of Raguel, who lived in Media at Ecbatana, also
heard insults from one of her father’s maids.

Tob 3:8 For she had been given in marriage seven times, and Asmodeus, the worst of demons, had killed her
bridegrooms one after another before ever they had slept with her as man with wife. The servant-girl said, “Yes,
you kill your bridegrooms yourself. That makes seven already to whom you have been given, and you have not
once been in luck yet.

Tob 3:9 Just because your bridegrooms have died, that is no reason for punishing us. Go and join them, and
may we be spared the sight of any child of yours!”.



Tob 3:10 That day, she grieved, she sobbed, and she went up to her father’s room intending to hang herself.

But then she thought, “Suppose they were to blame my father! They would say, ‘You had an only daughter
whom you loved, and now she has hanged herself for grief’. I cannot cause my father a sorrow which would
bring down his old age to the dwelling of the dead. I should do better not to hang myself, but to beg the Lord to
let me die and not live to hear any more insults”.

Tob 3:1 1 And at this, by the window, with outstretched arms she said this prayer: You are blessed, O God of
mercy! May your name be blessed for ever, and may all things you have made bless you everlastingly.

Tob 3:12 And now I turn my face and I raise my eyes to you.

Tob 3:13 Let your word deliver me from earth; I can hear myself insulted no longer.

Tob 3:14 O Lord, you know that I have remained pure; no man has touched me;

Tob 3:15 I have not dishonoured your name or my father’s name in this land of exile. I am my father’s only
daughter, he has no other child as heir; he has no brother at his side, nor has he any kinsman left for whom I
ought to keep myself. I have lost seven husbands already; why should I live any longer? If it does not please you
to take my life, then look on me with pity; I can no longer bear to hear myself defamed.

Tob 3:16 This time the prayer of each of them found favour before the glory of God,

Tob 3:17 and Raphael was sent to bring remedy to them both. He was to take the white spots from the eyes of
Tobit, so that he might see God’s light with his own eyes; and he was to give Sarah the daughter of Raguel as
bride to Tobias son of Tobit, and to rid her of Asmodeus, that worst of demons. For it was to Tobias before all
other suitors that she belonged by right. Tobit was coming back from the courtyard into the house at the same
moment as Sarah the daughter of Raguel was coming down from the upper room.

Tob 4:1 The same day Tobit remembered the silver that he had left with Gabael at Rhages in Media

Tob 4:2 and thought, “I have come to the point of praying for death; I should do well to call my son Tobias and

tell him about the money before I die”.

Tob 4:3 He summoned his son Tobias and told him, “When I die, give me an honourable burial. Honour your
mother, and never abandon her all the days of your life. Do all that she wants, and give her no reason for sorrow.
Tob 4:4 Remember, my child, all the risks she ran for your sake when you were in her womb. And when she
dies, bury her at my side in the same grave.

Tob 4:5 “My child, be faithful to the Lord all your days. Never entertain the will to sin or to transgress his laws.

Do good works all the days of your life, never follow ways that are not upright;

Tob 4:6 for if you act in truthfulness, you will be successful in all your actions, as everyone is who practises what
is upright.

Tob 4:7 “Set aside part of your goods for almsgiving. Never turn your face from the poor and God will never turn
his from you.

Tob 4:8 Measure your alms by what you have; if you have much, give more; if you have little, do not be afraid to
give less in alms.

Tob 4:9 So doing, you will lay up for yourself a great treasure for the day of necessity.

Tob 4:10 For almsgiving delivers from death and saves people from passing down to darkness.

Tob 4:11 Almsgiving is a most effective offering for all those who do it in the presence of the Most High.

Tob 4:12 “My child, avoid all loose conduct. Choose a wife of your father’s stock. Do not take a foreign wife
outside your father’s tribe, because we are the children of the prophets. Remember Noah, Abraham, Isaac and
Jacob, our ancestors from the beginning. All of them took wives from their own kindred, and they were blessed in
their children, and their race will inherit the earth.

Tob 4:13 You, too, my child, must love your own brothers; never presume to despise your brothers, the sons
and daughters of your people; choose your wife from among them. For pride brings ruin and much worry;
idleness causes need and poverty, for the mother of famine is idleness.

Tob 4:14 “Do not keep back until next day the wages of those who work for you; pay them at once. If you serve
God you will be rewarded. Be careful, my child, in all you do, well-disciplined in all your behaviour.

Tob 4:15 Do to no one what you would not want done to you. Do not drink wine to the point of drunkenness; do
not let excess be your travelling companion.

Tob 4:16 “Give your bread to those who are hungry, and your clothes to those who lack clothing. Of whatever
you own in plenty, devote a proportion to almsgiving; and when you give alms, do it ungrudgingly.

Tob 4:17 Be generous with bread and wine on the graves of upright people, but not for the sinner.

Tob 4:18 “Ask advice of every wise person; never scorn any profitable advice.

Tob 4:19 Bless the Lord God in everything; beg him to guide your ways and bring your paths and purposes to
their end. For wisdom is not the property of every nation; their desire for what is good is conferred by the Lord. At
his will he lifts up or he casts down to the depths of the dwelling of the dead. So now, my child, remember these
precepts and never let them fade from your heart.

Tob 4:20 “Now, my child, I must tell you I have left ten talants of silver with Gabael son of Gabrias, at Rhages in
Media.



Tob 4:21 Do not be afraid, my child, if we have grown poor. You have great wealth if you fear God, if you shun
every kind of sin and if you do what is pleasing to the Lord your God”.

Tob 5:1 Tobias then replied to his father Tobit, “Father, I shall do everything you have told me.

Tob 5:2 But how am I to recover the silver from him? He does not know me, nor I him. What token am I to give
him for him to believe me and hand the silver over to me? And besides, I do not know what roads to take for this
journey into Media”.

Tob 5:3 Then Tobit answered his son Tobias, “Each of us set his signature to a note which I cut in two, so that
each could keep half of it. I took one piece, and put the other with the silver. To think it was twenty years ago I
left this silver in his keeping! And now, my child, find a trustworthy travelling companion — we shall pay him for
his time until you arrive back — and then go and collect the silver from Gabael”.

Tob 5:4 Tobias went out to look for a man who knew the way to go with him to Media. Outside he found
Raphael the angel standing facing him, though he did not guess he was an angel of God.

Tob 5:5 He said, “Where do you come from, friend?”. The angel replied, “I am one of your brother Israelites; I
have come to these parts to look for work”. Tobias asked, “Do you know the road to Media?”.

Tob 5:6 The other replied, “Certainly I do, I have been there many times; I have knowledge and experience of all
the ways. I have often been to Media and stayed with Gabael one of our kinsmen who lives at Rhages in Media.
It usually takes two full days to get from Ecbatana to Rhages; Rhages lies in the mountains, and Ecbatana is in
the middle of the plain”.

Tob 5:7 Tobias said, “Wait for me, friend, while I go and tell my father; I need you to come with me; I shall pay
you for your time”.

Tob 5:8 The other replied, “Good, I shall wait; but do not be long”.

Tob 5:9 Tobias went in and told his father that he had found one of their brother Israelites. And the father said,
“Fetch him in; I want to find out about his family and tribe. I must see if he is going to be a reliable companion for
you, my child”. So Tobias went out and called him, “Friend”, he said, “my father wants you”.

Tob 5:10 The angel came into the house; Tobit greeted him, and the other answered, wishing him happiness in
plenty. Tobit replied, “Can I ever be happy again? I am a blind man; I no longer see the light of heaven; I am
sunk in darkness like the dead who see the light no more. I am a man buried alive; I hear people speak but
cannot see them”. The angel said, “Take comfort; before long God will heal you. Take comfort”. Tobit said, “My
son Tobias wishes to go to Media. Will you join him as his guide? Brother, I will pay you”. He replied, “I am willing
to go with him; I know all the ways; I have often been to Media, I have crossed all its plains and mountains, and I
know all its roads”.

Tob 5:1 1 Tobit said, “Brother, what family and what tribe do you belong to? Will you tell me, brother?”.

Tob 5:12 “What does my tribe matter to you?”. the angel said. Tobit said, “I want to be quite sure whose son you
are and what your name is”.

Tob 5:13 The angel said, “I am Azarias, son of the great Ananias, one of your kinsmen”.

Tob 5:14 “Welcome and greetings, brother! Do not be offended at my wanting to know the name of your family; I
find you are my kinsman of a good and honourable line. I know Ananias and Nathan, the two sons of the great
Shemaiah. They used to go to Jerusalem with me; we have worshipped together there and they have never
strayed from the right path. Your brothers are worthy men; you come of good stock; welcome”.

Tob 5:15 He went on, “I engage you at a drachma a day, with the same expenses as my own son’s. Complete
the journey with my son

Tob 5:16 and I shall go beyond the agreed wage”. The angel replied, “I shall complete the journey with him. Do
not be afraid. On the journey outward all will be well; on the journey back all will be well; the road is safe”.

Tob 5:17 Tobit said, “Blessings on you, brother!”. Then he turned to his son. “My child”, he said, “prepare what you
need for the journey, and set off with your brother. May God in heaven protect you abroad and bring you both
back to me safe and sound! May his angel go with you and protect you, my child!”. Tobias left the house to set
out and kissed his father and mother. Tobit said, “A happy journey!”.

Tob 5:18 His mother burst into tears and said to Tobit, “Why must you send my child away? Is he not the staff of
our hands, as he goes about before us?

Tob 5:19 Surely money is not the only thing that matters? Surely it is not as precious as our child?

Tob 5:20 The way of life God had already given us was good enough”.

Tob 5:21 He said, “Do not think such thoughts. Going away and coming back, all will be well with our child. You
will see for yourself when he comes back safe and sound! Do not think such thoughts; do not worry on their
account, my sister.

Tob 5:22 A good angel will go with him; he will have a good journey and come back to us well and happy”.

Tob 6:1 And she dried her tears.

Tob 6:2 The boy left with the angel, and the dog followed behind. The two walked on, and when the first evening
came they camped beside the Tigris.

Tob 6:3 The boy had gone down to the river to wash his feet, when a great fish leapt out of the water and tried



to swallow his foot. The boy gave a shout

Tob 6:4 and the angel said, “Catch the fish; do not let it go”. The boy mastered the fish and pulled it onto the
bank.

Tob 6:5 The angel said, “Cut it open; take out gall, heart and liver; set these aside and throw the entrails away,
for gall and heart and liver have curative properties”.

Tob 6:6 The boy cut the fish open and took out gall and heart and liver. He fried part of the fish for his meal and
kept some for salting. Then they walked on again together until they were nearly in Media.

Tob 6:7 Then the boy asked the angel this question, “Brother Azarias, what can the fish’s heart, liver and gall
cure?”.

Tob 6:8 He replied, “You burn the fish’s heart and liver, and their smoke is used in the case of a man or woman
plagued by a demon or evil spirit; any such affliction disappears for good, leaving no trace.

Tob 6:9 As regards the gall, this is used as an eye ointment for anyone having white spots on his eyes; after
using it, you have only to blow on the spots to cure them”.

Tob 6:10 They entered Media and had nearly reached Ecbatana

Tob 6:1 1 when Raphael said to the boy, “Brother Tobias”. “Yes?”. he replied. The angel went on, “Tonight we are
to stay with Raguel, who is a kinsman of yours. He has a daughter called Sarah,

Tob 6:12 but apart from Sarah he has no other son or daughter. Now you are her next of kin; she belongs to you
before anyone else and you may claim her father’s inheritance. She is a thoughtful, courageous and very lovely
girl, and her father loves her dearly.

Tob 6:13 You have the right to marry her. Listen, brother; this very evening I shall speak about the girl to her
father and arrange for her to be betrothed to you, and when we come back from Rhages we can celebrate the
marriage. I assure you, Raguel has no right whatever to refuse you or to betroth her to anyone else. That would
be asking for death, as prescribed in the Book of Moses, once he is aware that kinship gives you the preëminent right to marry his daughter. So listen, brother. This very evening we shall speak about the girl and ask
for her hand in marriage. When we come back from Rhages we shall fetch her and take her home with us”.

Tob 6:14 Tobias replied to Raphael, “Brother Azarias, I have been told that she has already been given in
marriage seven times and that each time her bridegroom has died in the bridal room. He died the same night as
he entered her room; and I have heard people say it was a demon that killed them,

Tob 6:15 and this makes me afraid. To her the demon does no harm because he loves her, but as soon as a
man tries to approach her, he kills him. I am my father’s only son, and I have no wish to die. I do not want my
father and mother to grieve over me for the rest of their lives; they have no other son to bury them”.

Tob 6:16 The angel said, “Have you forgotten your father’s advice? After all, he urged you to choose a wife from
your father’s family. Listen then, brother. Do not worry about the demon; take her. This very evening, I promise,
she will be given you as your wife.

Tob 6:17 Then once you are in the bridal room, take the heart and liver of the fish and lay a little of it on the
burning incense. The reek will rise,

Tob 6:18 the demon will smell it and flee, and there is no danger that he will ever be found near the girl again.
Then, before you sleep together, first stand up, both of you, and pray. Ask the Lord of heaven to grant you his
grace and protection. Do not be afraid; she was destined for you from the beginning, and you are the one to
save her. She will follow you, and I pledge my word she will give you children who will be like brothers to you. Do
not worry”. And when Tobias heard Raphael say this, when he understood that Sarah was his sister, a
kinswoman of his father’s family, he fell so deeply in love with her that he could no longer call his heart his own.
Tob 7:1 As they entered Ecbatana, Tobias said, “Brother Azarias, take me at once to our brother Raguel’s”. And
he showed him the way to the house of Raguel, whom they found sitting beside his courtyard door. They greeted
him first, and he replied, “Welcome and greetings, brothers”. And he took them into his house.

Tob 7:2 He said to his wife Edna, “How like my brother Tobit this young man is!”.

Tob 7:3 Edna asked them where they came from; they said, “We are sons of Naphtali exiled in Nineveh”.

Tob 7:4 “Do you know our brother Tobit?”. “Yes”. “How is he?”.

Tob 7:5 “He is alive and well”. And Tobias added, “He is my father”.

Tob 7:6 Raguel leapt to his feet and kissed him and wept.

Tob 7:7 Then, finding words, he said, “Blessings on you, child! You are the son of a noble father. How sad it is
that someöne so bright and full of good deeds should have gone blind!”. He fell on the neck of his kinsman Tobias
and wept.

Tob 7:8 And his wife Edna wept for him, and so did his daughter Sarah.

Tob 7:9 Raguel killed a ram from the flock, and they gave them a warm welcome. They washed and bathed and
sat down to table. Then Tobias said to Raphael, “Brother Azarias, will you ask Raguel to give me my sister
Sarah?”.

Tob 7:10 Raguel overheard the words, and said to the young man, “Eat and drink, and make the most of your
evening; no one else has the right to take my daughter Sarah — no one but you, my brother. In any case even I



am not at liberty to give her to anyone else, since you are her next of kin. However, my boy, I must be frank with
you:

Tob 7:1 1 I have tried to find a husband for her seven times among our kinsmen, and all of them have died the
first evening, on going to her room. But for the present, my boy, eat and drink; the Lord will grant you his grace
and peace”. Tobias spoke out, “I will not hear of eating and drinking till you have come to a decision about me”.
Raguel answered, “Very well. Since, by the prescription of the Book of Moses she is given to you, Heaven itself
decrees she shall be yours. I therefore entrust your sister to you. From now on you are her brother and she is
your sister. She is given to you from today for ever. The Lord of heaven favour you tonight, my child, and grant
you his grace and peace”.

Tob 7:12 Raguel called for his daughter Sarah, took her by the hand and gave her to Tobias with these words, “I
entrust her to you; the law and the ruling recorded in the Book of Moses assign her to you as your wife. Take
her; bring her home safe and sound to your father’s house. The God of heaven grant you a good journey in
peace”.

Tob 7:13 Then he turned to her mother and asked her to fetch him writing paper. He drew up the marriage
contract, and so he gave his daughter as bride to Tobias according to the ordinance of the Law of Moses.

Tob 7:14 After this they began to eat and drink.

Tob 7:15 Raguel called his wife Edna and said, “My sister, prepare the second room and take her there”.

Tob 7:16 She went and made the bed in this room as he had ordered, and took her daughter to it. She wept
over her, then wiped away her tears and said, “Courage, daughter! May the Lord of heaven turn your grief to joy!
Courage, daughter!”. And she went out.

Tob 8:1 When they had finished eating and drinking and it seemed time to go to bed, the young man was taken
from the dining room to the bedroom.

Tob 8:2 Tobias remembered Raphael’s advice; he went to his bag, took the fish’s heart and liver out of it and put
some on the burning incense.

Tob 8:3 The reek of the fish distressed the demon, who fled through the air to Egypt. Raphael pursued him
there, shackled him and strangled him forthwith.

Tob 8:4 The parents meanwhile had gone out and shut the door behind them. Tobias rose from the bed, and
said to Sarah, “Get up, my sister! You and I must pray and petition our Lord to win his grace and his protection”.
Tob 8:5 She stood up, and they began praying for protection, and this was how he began: You are blessed, O
God of our fathers; blessed too is your name for ever and ever. Let the heavens bless you and all things you
have made for evermore.

Tob 8:6 You it was who created Adam, you who created Eve his wife to be his help and support; and from these
two the human race was born. You it was who said, “It is not right that the man should be alone; let us make him
a helper like him”.

Tob 8:7 And so I take my sister not for any lustful motive, but I do it in singleness of heart. Be kind enough to
have pity on her and on me and bring us to old age together.

Tob 8:8 And together they said, “Amen, Amen”,

Tob 8:9 and lay down for the night. But Raguel rose and called his servants, who came and helped him dig a
grave.

Tob 8:10 He had thought, “Heaven grant he does not die! We should be overwhelmed with ridicule and shame”.
Tob 8:1 1 When the grave was ready, Raguel went back to the house, called his wife

Tob 8:12 and said, “Will you send a maid to the room to see if Tobias is still alive? For if he is dead, we may be
able to bury him without anyone else knowing”.

Tob 8:13 They sent the maid, lit the lamp, opened the door and the maid went in. She found the two fast asleep
together;

Tob 8:14 she came out again and whispered, “He is not dead; all is well”.

Tob 8:15 Then Raguel blessed the God of heaven with these words: You are blessed, my God, with every
blessing that is pure; may you be blessed for evermore!

Tob 8:16 You are blessed for having made me glad. What I feared has not happened, instead you have shown
us your boundless mercy.

Tob 8:17 You are blessed for taking pity on this only son, this only daughter. Grant them, Master, your mercy
and your protection; let them live out their lives in happiness and in mercy.

Tob 8:18 And he made his servants fill the grave in before dawn broke.

Tob 8:19 He told his wife to make an ovenful of bread; he went to his flock, brought back two oxen and four
sheep and gave orders for them to be cooked; and preparations began.

Tob 8:20 He called Tobias and said, “I will not hear of your leaving here for a fortnight. You are to stay where
you are, eating and drinking, with me. You will make my daughter happy again after all her troubles.

Tob 8:21 After that, take away a half of all I have, and take her safe and sound back to your father. When my
wife and I are dead you shall have the other half. Courage, my boy! I am your father, and Edna is your mother.



We are your parents in future, as we are your sister’s. Courage, my son!”.

Tob 9:1 Then Tobias turned to Raphael.

Tob 9:2 “Brother Azarias”, he said, “take four servants and two camels and leave for Rhages.

Tob 9:3 Go to Gabael’s house, give him the receipt and see about the money; then invite him to come with you
to my wedding feast.

Tob 9:4 You know that my father must be counting the days and that I cannot lose a single one without worrying
him.

Tob 9:5 You see what Raguel has pledged himself to do; I am bound by his oath”. So Raphael left for Rhages in
Media with the four servants and two camels. They stayed with Gabael, and Raphael showed him the receipt.

He told him about the marriage of Tobias son of Tobit and gave him his invitation to the wedding feast. Gabael
started counting out the sacks to him — the seals were intact — and they loaded them on to the camels.

Tob 9:6 Early in the morning they set off together for the feast, and reached Raguel’s house where they found
Tobias dining. He rose to greet Gabael, who burst into tears and blessed him with the words, “Excellent son of a
father beyond reproach, just and generous in his dealings! The Lord give heaven’s blessing to you, to your wife,
to your wife’s father and mother! Blessed be God for granting me the sight of this living image of my cousin
Tobit!”.

Tob 10:1 Every day, meanwhile, Tobit kept reckoning the days required for the journey there and the journey
back. The full number went by, and still his son had not come.

Tob 10:2 Then he thought, “I hope he has not been delayed there! I hope Gabael is not dead, so that no one will
give him the silver”.

Tob 10:3 And he began to worry.

Tob 10:4 His wife Anna kept saying, “My son is dead! He is no longer among the living!”. And she began to weep
and mourn over her son. She kept saying,

Tob 10:5 “Alas! I should never have let you leave me, my child, you, the light of my eyes”.

Tob 10:6 And Tobit would reply, “Hush, my sister! Do not worry. All is well with him. Something has happened
there to delay them. His companion is someöne we can trust, one of our kinsmen at that. Do not lose heart, my
sister.

Tob 10:7 He will soon be here”. But all she would say was, “Leave me alone; do not try to deceive me. My child
is dead”. And every day she would go abruptly out to watch the road by which her son had left. She trusted no
eyes but her own. Once the sun had set she would come home again, only to weep and moan all night, unable
to sleep. After the fourteen days of feasting that Raguel had sworn to keep for his daughter’s marriage, Tobias
came to him and said, “Let me go now; my father and mother must have lost all hope of seeing me again. So I
beg you, father, to let me return to my father’s house; I have told you the plight he was in when I left him”.

Tob 10:8 Raguel said to Tobias, “Stay, my son, stay with me. I shall send messengers to your father Tobit to
give him news of you”.

Tob 10:9 But Tobias pressed him, “No, I beg you to let me go back to my father’s house”.

Tob 10:10 Without more ado, Raguel committed Sarah his bride into his keeping. He gave Tobias half his
wealth, slaves, men and women, oxen and sheep, donkeys and camels, clothes and money and household
things.

Tob 10:1 1 And so he let them leave happily. To Tobias he said these parting words, “Good health, my son, and
a happy journey! May the Lord of heaven be gracious to you and to your wife Sarah! I hope to see your children
before I die”.

Tob 10:12 To his daughter Sarah he said, “Go now to your father-in-law’s house, since henceforward they are
as much your parents as those who gave you life. Go in peace, my daughter, I hope to hear nothing but good of
you, as long as I live”. He said goodbye to them and let them go. Edna in her turn said to Tobias, “Dear son and
brother, may it please the Lord to bring you back again! I hope to live long enough to see the children of you and
my daughter Sarah before I die. In the sight of the Lord I give my daughter into your keeping. Never make her
unhappy as long as you live. Go in peace, my son. Henceforward I am your mother and Sarah is your sister.

May we all live happily for the rest of our lives!”. And she kissed them both and saw them set out happily.

Tob 10:13 Tobias left Raguel’s house with his mind at ease. In his gladness he blessed the Lord of heaven and
earth, the King of all that is, for the happy issue of his travels. He gave this blessing to Raguel and his wife Edna,
“May it be my happiness to honour you for the rest of my life!”.

Tob 1 1:1 They were nearly at Kaserin, opposite Nineveh,

Tob 1 1 :2 when Raphael said, “You know the plight in which we left your father;

Tob 1 1 :3 let us go on ahead of your wife and prepare the house ourselves while she travels behind with the
others”.

Tob 1 1 :4 They went on together (Raphael warned Tobias to take the gall with him) and the dog followed them.
Tob 1 1 :5 Anna was sitting, watching the road by which her son would come.

Tob 1 1 :6 She was sure at once it must be he and said to the father, “Here comes your son, with his companion”.



Tob 1 1 :7 Raphael said to Tobias before he reached his father, “I give you my word that your father’s eyes will
open.

Tob 1 1 :8 You must put the fish’s gall to his eyes; the medicine will smart and will draw a filmy white skin off his
eyes. And your father will no more be blind but will be able to see the light”.

Tob 1 1 :9 The mother ran forward and threw her arms round her son’s neck. “Now I can die”, she said, “I have
seen you again”. And she wept.

Tob 11:10 Tobit rose to his feet and stumbled across the courtyard through the door. Tobias came on towards
him

Tob 11:11 (he had the fish’s gall in his hand). He blew into his eyes and said, steadying him, “Take courage,
father!”. With this he applied the medicine, left it there a while,

Tob 11:12 then with both hands peeled away a filmy skin from the corners of his eyes.

Tob 11:13 Then his father fell on his neck

Tob 11:14 and wept. He exclaimed, “I can see you, my son, the light of my eyes!”. And he said: Blessed be God!
Blessed be his great name! Blessed be all his holy angels! Blessed be his great name for evermore!

Tob 11:15 For, having afflicted me, he has had pity on me and now I see my son Tobias! Tobias went indoors,
joyfully blessing God at the top of his voice. Then he told his father everything; how his journey had been
successful and he had brought the silver back; how he had married Sarah the daughter of Raguel; how she was
following him now, close behind, and could not be far from the gates of Nineveh.

Tob 11:16 Tobit set off to the gates of Nineveh to meet his daughter-in-law, giving joyful praise to God as he
went. When the people of Nineveh saw him walking without a guide and stepping forward as briskly as of old,
they were astonished.

Tob 11:17 Tobit described to them how God had taken pity on him and had opened his eyes. Then Tobit met
Sarah the bride of his son Tobias, and blessed her in these words. “Welcome, daughter! Blessed be your God for
sending you to us, my daughter. Blessings on your father, blessings on my son Tobias, blessings on yourself,
my daughter. Welcome now to your own house in joyfulness and in blessedness. Come in, my daughter”. That
day brought joy to the Jews of Nineveh,

Tob 11:18 and his cousins Ahikar and Nadab came to share in Tobit’s happiness.

Tob 12:1 When the wedding feast was over, Tobit called his son Tobias and said, “My son, you ought to think
about paying the amount due to your fellow traveller; give him more than the figure agreed on”.

Tob 12:2 “Father”, he replied, “how much am I to give him for his help? Even if I give him half the goods he
brought back with me, I shall not be the loser.

Tob 12:3 He has brought me back safe and sound, he has cured my wife, he has brought the money back too,
and now he has cured you as well. How much am I to give him for all this?”.

Tob 12:4 Tobit said, “He has richly earned half what he brought back”.

Tob 12:5 So Tobias called his companion and said, “Take half of what you brought back, in payment for all you
have done, and go in peace”.

Tob 12:6 Then Raphael took them both aside and said, “Bless God, utter his praise before all the living for the
favour he has shown you. Bless and extol his name. Proclaim before all people the deeds of God as they
deserve, and never tire of giving him thanks.

Tob 12:7 It is right to keep the secret of a king, yet right to reveal and publish the works of God as they deserve.
Do what is good, and no evil can befall you.

Tob 12:8 “Prayer with fasting and alms with uprightness are better than riches with iniquity. Better to practise
almsgiving than to hoard up gold.

Tob 12:9 Almsgiving saves from death and purges every kind of sin. Those who give alms have their fill of days;
Tob 12:10 those who commit sin and do evil bring harm on themselves.

Tob 12:1 1 “I am going to tell you the whole truth, hiding nothing from you. I have already told you that it is right
to keep the secret of a king, yet right too to reveal in a worthy way the words of God.

Tob 12:12 So you must know that when you and Sarah were at prayer, it was I who offered your supplications
before the glory of the Lord and who read them; so too when you were burying the dead.

Tob 12:13 When you did not hesitate to get up and leave the table to go and bury a dead man, I was sent to test
your faith,

Tob 12:14 and at the same time God sent me to heal you and your daughter-in-law Sarah.

Tob 12:15 I am Raphael, one of the seven angels who stand ever ready to enter the presence of the glory of the
Lord”.

Tob 12:16 They were both overwhelmed with awe; they fell on their faces in terror.

Tob 12:17 But the angel said, “Do not be afraid; peace be with you. Bless God for ever.

Tob 12:18 As far as I was concerned, when I was with you, my presence was not by any decision of mine, but
by the will of God; he is the one whom you must bless as long as you live, he the one that you must praise.

Tob 12:19 You thought you saw me eating, but that was appearance and no more.



Tob 12:20 Now bless the Lord on earth and give thanks to God. I am about to return to him who sent me from
above. Write down all that has happened”. And he rose in the air.

Tob 12:21 When they stood up again, he was no longer visible. They praised God with hymns; they thanked him
for having performed such wonders; had not an angel of God appeared to them?

Tob 13:1 And he said: Blessed be God who lives for ever, for his reign endures throughout all ages!

Tob 13:2 For he both punishes and pardons; he sends people down to the depths of the underworld and draws
them up from utter Destruction; no one can escape his hand.

Tob 13:3 Declare his praise before the nations, you who are the children of Israel! For if he has scattered you
among them,

Tob 13:4 there too he has shown you his greatness. Extol him before all the living; he is our Lord and he is our
God; he is our Father, and he is God for ever and ever.

Tob 1 3:5 Though he punishes you for your iniquities, he will take pity on you all; he will gather you from every
nation wherever you have been scattered.

Tob 1 3:6 If you return to him with all your heart and all your soul, behaving honestly towards him, then he will
return to you and hide his face from you no longer. Consider how well he has treated you; loudly give him
thanks. Bless the Lord of justice and extol the King of the ages. I for my part sing his praise in the country of my
exile; I make his power and greatness known to a nation that has sinned. Sinners, return to him; let your conduct
be upright before him; perhaps he will be gracious to you and take pity on you.

Tob 13:7 I for my part extol God and my soul rejoices in the King of heaven. Let his greatness
Tob 13:8 be on every tongue, his praises be sung in Jerusalem.

Tob 1 3:9 Jerusalem, Holy City, God has scourged you for what you have done but will still take pity on the
children of the upright.

Tob 13:10 Thank the Lord as he deserves and bless the King of the ages, that your Temple may be rebuilt with
joy within you; within you he may comfort every exile, and within you he may love all those who are distressed,
for all generations to come.

Tob 13:1 1 A bright light will shine over all the regions of the earth; many nations will come from far away, from
all the ends of the earth, to dwell close to the holy name of the Lord God, with gifts in their hands for the King of
heaven. Within you, generation after generation will proclaim their joy, and the name of her who is Elect will
endure through the generations to come.

Tob 13:12 Cursed be any who affront you, cursed be any who destroy you, who throw down your walls, who
rase your towers, who burn your houses! Eternally blessed be he who rebuilds you!

Tob 13:13 Then you will exult, and rejoice over the children of the upright, for they will all have been gathered in
and will bless the Lord of the ages.

Tob 13:14 Blessed are those who love you, blessed those who rejoice over your peace, blessed those who
have mourned over all your punishment! For they will soon rejoice within you, witness all your blessedness in
days to come.

Tob 13:15 My soul blesses the Lord, the great King

Tob 13:16 because Jerusalem will be built anew and his house for ever and ever. What bliss, if one of my family
be left to see your glory and praise the King of heaven! The gates of Jerusalem will be built of sapphire and of
emerald, and all your walls of precious stone, the towers of Jerusalem will be built of gold and their battlements
of pure gold.

Tob 13:17 The streets of Jerusalem will be paved with ruby and with stones from Ophir; the gates of Jerusalem
will resound with songs of exultation; and all her houses will say, “Alleluia! Blessed be the God of Israel”. Within
you they will bless the holy name for ever and ever.

Tob 14:1 The end of the hymns of Tobit. Tobit died when he was a hundred and twelve years old and received
an honourable burial in Nineveh.

Tob 14:2 He had been sixty-two when he went blind; and after his cure, he lived in comfort, practising
almsgiving and continually praising God and extolling his greatness.

Tob 14:3 When he was at the point of death he summoned his son Tobias and gave him these instructions,

Tob 14:4 “My son, take your children and hurry away to Media, since I believe the word of God pronounced over
Nineveh by Nahum. Everything will come true, everything happen that the emissaries of God, the prophets of
Israel, have predicted against Assyria and Nineveh; not one of their words will prove empty. It will all take place
in due time. You will be safer in Media than in Assyria or in Babylonia. Since I for my part know and believe that
everything God has said will come true; so it will be, and not a word of the prophecies will fail. “A census will be
taken of our brothers living in the land of Israel and they will be exiled far from their own fair country. The entire
territory of Israel will become a desert, and Samaria and Jerusalem will become a desert, and the house of God,
for a time, will be laid waste and burnt.

Tob 14:5 Then once again God will take pity on them and bring them back to the land of Israel. They will rebuild
his house, although it will be less beautiful than the first, until the time is fulfilled. But after this, all will return from



captivity and rebuild Jerusalem in all her glory, and the house of God will be rebuilt within her as the prophets of
Israel have foretold.

Tob 14:6 And all the people of the whole earth will be converted and will reverence God with all sincerity. All will
renounce their false gods who have led them astray into error,

Tob 14:7 and will bless the God of ages in uprightness. All the Israelites spared in those days will remember
God in sincerity of heart. They will come and gather in Jerusalem and thereäfter dwell securely in the land of
Abraham, which will be theirs. And those who sincerely love God will rejoice. And those who commit sin and
wickedness will vanish from the earth.

Tob 14:8 “And now, my children, I lay this duty on you; serve God sincerely, and do what is pleasing to him. And
lay on your children the obligation to behave uprightly, to give alms, to keep God in mind and to bless his name
always, sincerely and with all their might.

Tob 14:9 “So then, my son, leave Nineveh, do not stay here.

Tob 14:10 As soon as you have buried your mother next to me, go the same day, whenever it may be, and do
not linger in this country where I see wickedness and perfidy unashamedly triumphant. Consider, my child, all
the things done by Nadab to his foster-father Ahikar. Was not Ahikar forced to go underground, though still a
living man? But God made the criminal pay for his outrage before his victim’s eyes, since Ahikar came back to
the light of day, while Nadab went down to everlasting darkness in punishment for plotting against Ahikar’s life.
Because of his good works Ahikar escaped the deadly snare Nadab had laid for him, and Nadab fell into it to his
own ruin.

Tob 14:1 1 So, my children, you see what comes of almsgiving, and what wickedness leads to, I mean to death.
But now breath fails me”. They laid him back on his bed; he died and was buried with honour.

Tob 14:12 When his mother died, Tobias buried her beside his father. Then he left for Media with his wife and
children. He lived in Ecbatana with Raguel, his father-in-law.

Tob 14:13 He treated the ageing parents of his wife with every care and respect, and later buried them in
Ecbatana in Media. Tobias inherited the patrimony of Raguel besides that of his father Tobit.

Tob 14:14 Much honoured, he lived to the age of a hundred and seventeen years.

Tob 14:15 Before he died he witnessed the ruin of Nineveh. He saw the Ninevites taken prisoner and deported
to Media by Cyaxares king of Media. He blessed God for everything he inflicted on the Ninevites and Assyrians.
Before his death he had the opportunity of rejoicing over the fate of Nineveh, and he blessed the Lord God for
ever and ever. Amen.

Jdt 1 :1 It was the twelfth year of Nebuchadnezzar who reigned over the Assyrians in the great city of Nineveh.
Arphaxad was then reigning over the Medes in Ecbatana.

Jdt 1 :2 He surrounded this city with walls of dressed stones three cubits thick and six cubits long, making the
rampart seventy cubits high and fifty cubits wide.

Jdt 1 :3 At the gates he placed towers one hundred cubits high and, at the foundations, sixty cubits wide,

Jdt 1 :4 the gates themselves being seventy cubits high and forty wide to allow his forces to march out in a body
and his infantry to parade freely.

Jdt 1 :5 About this time King Nebuchadnezzar gave battle to King Arphaxad in the great plain lying in the territory
of Ragae.

Jdt 1:6 Supporting him were all the peoples from the highlands, all from the Euphrates and Tigris and
Hydaspes, and those from the plains who were subject to Arioch, king of the Elymaeans. Thus many nations had
mustered to take part in the battle of the Cheleoudites.

Jdt 1 :7 Nebuchadnezzar king of the Assyrians sent a message to all the inhabitants of Persia, to all the
inhabitants of the western countries, Cilicia, Damascus, Lebanon, Anti-Lebanon, to all those along the coast,

Jdt 1 :8 to the peoples of Carmel, Gilead, Upper Galilee, the great plain of Esdraelon,

Jdt 1 :9 to the people of Samaria and its outlying towns, to those beyond Jordan, as far away as Jerusalem,
Bethany, Chelous, Kadesh, the river of Egypt, Tahpanhes, Rameses and the whole territory of Goshen,

Jdt 1:10 beyond Tanis too and Memphis, and to all the inhabitants of Egypt as far as the frontiers of Ethiopia.

Jdt 1 : 1 1 But the inhabitants of these countries ignored the summons of Nebuchadnezzar king of the Assyrians
and did not rally to him to make war. They were not afraid of him, since in their view he appeared isolated.

Hence they sent his ambassadors back with nothing achieved and in disgrace.

Jdt 1:12 Nebuchadnezzar was furious with all these countries. He swore by his throne and kingdom to take
revenge on all the territories of Cilicia, Damascus and Syria, of the Moabites and of the Ammonites, of Judaea
and Egypt as far as the limits of the two seas, and to ravage them with the sword.

Jdt 1:13 In the seventeenth year, he gave battle with his whole army to King Arphaxad and in this battle
defeated him. He routed Arphaxad’s entire army and all his cavalry and chariots;

Jdt 1 : 14 he occupied his towns and advanced on Ecbatana; he seized its towers and plundered its market
places, reducing its former magnificence to a mockery.

Jdt 1:15 He later captured Arphaxad in the mountains of Ragae and, thrusting him through with his spears,



destroyed him once and for all.

Jdt 1:16 He then retired with his troops and all who had joined forces with him: a vast horde of armed men.

Then he and his army gave themselves up to carefree feasting for a hundred and twenty days.

Jdt 2:1 In the eighteenth year, on the twenty-second day of the first month, a rumour ran through the palace that
Nebuchadnezzar king of the Assyrians was to have his revenge on all the countries, as he had threatened.

Jdt 2:2 Summoning his general staff and senior officers, he held a secret conference with them, and with his
own lips pronounced utter destruction on the entire area.

Jdt 2:3 It was then decreed that everyone should be put to death who had not answered the king’s appeal.

Jdt 2:4 When the council was over, Nebuchadnezzar king of the Assyrians sent for Holofernes, general-in-chief
of his armies and subordinate only to himself. He said to him,

Jdt 2:5 Thus speaks the Great King, lord of the whole world, ‘Go; take men of proven valour, about a hundred
and twenty thousand foot soldiers and a strong company of horse with twelve thousand cavalrymen;

Jdt 2:6 then advance against all the western lands, since these people have disregarded my call.

Jdt 2:7 Bid them have earth and water ready, because in my rage I am about to march on them; the feet of my
soldiers will cover the whole face of the earth, and I shall plunder it.

Jdt 2:8 Their wounded will fill the valleys and the torrents, and rivers, blocked with their dead, will overflow.

Jdt 2:9 I shall lead them captive to the ends of the earth.

Jdt 2:10 Now go! Begin by conquering this whole region for me. If they surrender to you, hold them for me until
the time comes to punish them.

Jdt 2:11 But if they resist, look on no one with clemency, hand them over to slaughter and plunder throughout
the territory entrusted to you.

Jdt 2:12 For by my life and by the living power of my kingdom I have spoken. All this I shall do by my power.

Jdt 2:13 And you, neglect none of your master’s commands, act strictly according to my orders without further
delay’”.

Jdt 2:14 Leaving the presence of his sovereign, Holofernes immediately summoned all the marshals, generals
and officers of the Assyrian army

Jdt 2:15 and detailed the picked troops as his master had ordered, about a hundred and twenty thousand men
and a further twelve thousand mounted archers.

Jdt 2:16 He organised these in the normal battle formation.

Jdt 2:17 He then secured vast numbers of camels, donkeys and mules to carry the baggage, and innumerable
sheep, oxen and goats for food supplies.

Jdt 2:18 Every man received full rations and a generous sum of gold and silver from the king’s purse.

Jdt 2:19 He then set out for the campaign with his whole army, in advance of King Nebuchadnezzar, to
overwhelm the whole western region with his chariots, his horsemen and his picked body of foot.

Jdt 2:20 A motley gathering followed in his rear, as numerous as locusts or the grains of sand on the ground;
there was no counting their multitude.

Jdt 2:21 Thus they set out from Nineveh and marched for three days towards the Plain of Bectileth. From
Bectileth they went on to pitch camp near the mountains that lie to the north of Upper Cilicia.

Jdt 2:22 From there Holofernes advanced into the highlands with his whole army, infantry, horsemen, chariots.
Jdt 2:23 He cut his way through Put and Lud, carried away captive all the sons of Rassis and sons of Ishmael
living on the verge of the desert south of Cheleon,

Jdt 2:24 marched along the Euphrates, crossed Mesopotamia, razed all the fortified towns controlling the Wadi
Abron and reached the sea.

Jdt 2:25 Next he attacked the territories of Cilicia, butchering all who offered him resistance, advanced on the
southern frontiers of Japheth, facing Arabia,

Jdt 2:26 completely encircled the Midianites, burned their tents and plundered their sheep-folds,

Jdt 2:27 made his way down to the Damascus plain at the time of the wheat harvest, set fire to the fields,
destroyed the flocks and herds, sacked the towns, laid the countryside waste and put all the young men to the
sword.

Jdt 2:28 Fear and trembling seized all the coastal peoples; those of Sidon and Tyre, those of Sur, Ocina and
Jamnia. The populations of Azotos and Ascalon were panic-stricken.

Jdt 3:1 They therefore sent envoys to him to sue for peace, to say,

Jdt 3:2 “We are servants of the great King Nebuchadnezzar; we lie prostrate before you. Treat us as you think
fit.

Jdt 3:3 Our cattle-farms, all our land, all our wheat fields, our flocks and herds, all the sheep-folds in our
encampments are at your disposal. Do with them as you please.

Jdt 3:4 Our towns and their inhabitants too are at your service; go and treat them as you think fit”.

Jdt 3:5 These men came to Holofernes and delivered the message as above.

Jdt 3:6 He then made his way down to the coast with his army and stationed garrisons in all the fortified towns,



levying outstanding men there as auxiliaries.

Jdt 3:7 The people of these cities and of all the other towns in the neighbourhood welcomed him, wearing
garlands and dancing to the sound of tambourines.

Jdt 3:8 But he demolished their shrines and cut down their sacred trees, carrying out his commission to destroy
all local gods so that the nations should worship Nebuchadnezzar alone and people of every language and
nationality should hail him as a god.

Jdt 3:9 Thus he reached the edge of Esdraelon, in the neighbourhood of Dothan, a village facing the great ridge
of Judaea.

Jdt 3:10 He pitched camp between Geba and Scythopolis and stayed there a full month to re-provision his
forces.

Jdt 4:1 When the Israelites living in Judaea heard how Holofernes, general-in-chief of Nebuchadnezzar king of
the Assyrians, had treated the various nations, plundering their temples and destroying them,

Jdt 4:2 they were thoroughly alarmed at his approach and trembled for Jerusalem and the Temple of the Lord
their God.

Jdt 4:3 They had returned from captivity only a short time before, and the resettlement of the people in Judaea
and the reconsecration of the sacred furnishings, of the altar, and of the Temple, which had been profaned, were
of recent date.

Jdt 4:4 They therefore alerted the whole of Samaria, Kona, Beth-Horon, Belmain, Jericho, Choba, Aesora and
the Salem valley.

Jdt 4:5 They occupied the summits of the highest mountains and fortified the villages on them; they laid in
supplies for the coming war, as the fields had just been harvested.

Jdt 4:6 Joakim the high priest, resident in Jerusalem at the time, wrote to the inhabitants of Bethulia and of
Betomesthaim, two towns facing Esdraelon, towards the plain of Dothan.

Jdt 4:7 He ordered them to occupy the mountain passes, the only means of access to Judaea, for there it would
be easy for them to halt an attacking force, the narrowness of the approach not allowing men to advance more
than two abreast.

Jdt 4:8 The Israelites carried out the orders of Joakim the high priest and of the people’s Council of Elders in
session at Jerusalem.

Jdt 4:9 All the men of Israel cried most fervently to God and humbled themselves before him.

Jdt 4:10 They, their wives, their children, their cattle, all their resident aliens, hired or slave, wrapped sackcloth
round their loins.

Jdt 4:1 1 All the Israelites in Jerusalem, including women and children, lay prostrate in front of the Temple, and
with ashes on their heads stretched out their hands before the Lord.

Jdt 4:12 They draped the altar itself in sackcloth and fervently joined together in begging the God of Israel not to
let their children be carried off, their wives distributed as booty, the towns of their heritage destroyed, the Temple
profaned and desecrated for the heathen to gloat over.

Jdt 4:13 The Lord heard them and looked kindly on their distress. The people fasted for many days throughout
Judaea as well as in Jerusalem before the sanctuary of the Lord Almighty.

Jdt 4:14 Joakim the high priest and all who stood before the Lord, the Lord’s priests and ministers, wore
sackcloth round their loins as they offered the perpetual burnt offering and the votive and voluntary offerings of
the people.

Jdt 4:15 With ashes on their turbans they earnestly called on the Lord to look kindly on the House of Israel.

Jdt 5: 1 Holofernes, general-in-chief of the Assyrian army, received the intelligence that the Israelites were
preparing for war, that they had closed the mountain passes, fortified all the high peaks and laid obstructions in
the plains.

Jdt 5:2 Holofernes was furious. He summoned all the princes of Moab, all the generals of Ammon and all the
satraps of the coastal regions.

Jdt 5:3 “Men of Canaan”, he said, “tell me: what people is this that occupies the hill-country? What towns does it
inhabit? How large is its army? What are the sources of its power and strength? Who is the king who rules it and
commands its army?

Jdt 5:4 Why have they disdained to wait on me, as all the western peoples have?”.

Jdt 5:5 Achior, leader of all the Ammonites, replied, “May my lord be pleased to listen to what your servant is
going to say. I shall give you the facts about these mountain folk whose home lies close to you. You will hear no
lie from the mouth of your servant.

Jdt 5:6 These people are descended from the Chaldaeans.

Jdt 5:7 They once came to live in Mesopotamia, because they did not want to follow the gods of their ancestors
who lived in Chaldaea.

Jdt 5:8 They abandoned the way of their ancestors to worship the God of heaven, the God they learnt to
acknowledge. Banished from the presence of their own gods, they fled to Mesopotamia where they lived for a



long time.

Jdt 5:9 When God told them to leave their home and set out for Canaan, they settled there and accumulated
gold and silver and great herds of cattle.

Jdt 5:10 Next, famine having overwhelmed the land of Canaan, they went down to Egypt where they stayed till
they were well nourished. There they became a great multitude, a race beyond counting.

Jdt 5:1 1 But the king of Egypt turned against them and exploited them by forcing them to make bricks; he
degraded them, reducing them to slavery.

Jdt 5:12 They cried to their God, who struck the entire land of Egypt with incurable plagues, and the Egyptians
expelled them.

Jdt 5:13 God dried up the Red Sea before them

Jdt 5:14 and led them forward by way of Sinai and Kadesh-Barnea. Having driven off all the inhabitants of the
desert,

Jdt 5:15 they settled in the land of the Amorites and in their strength exterminated the entire population of
Heshbon. Then, having crossed the Jordan, they took possession of all the hill-country,

Jdt 5:16 driving out the Canaanites before them and the Perizzites, Jebusites, Shechemites and all the
Girgashites, and lived there for many years.

Jdt 5:17 All the while they did not sin before their God, prosperity was theirs, for they have a God who hates
wickedness.

Jdt 5:18 But when they turned from the path he had marked out for them some were exterminated in a series of battles, others were taken captive to a foreign land. The Temple of their God was razed to the ground and their towns were seized by their enemies.

Jdt 5:19 Then having turned once again to their God, they came back from the places to which they had been
dispersed and scattered, regained possession of Jerusalem, where they have their Temple, and reoccupied the
hill-country which had been left deserted.

Jdt 5:20 So, now, master and lord, if this people has committed any fault, if they have sinned against their God,
let us first be sure that they really have this reason to fail, then advance and attack them.

Jdt 5:21 But if their nation is guiltless, my lord would do better to abstain, for fear that their Lord and God should
protect them. We should then become the laughing-stock of the whole world”.

Jdt 5:22 When Achior had ended this speech, all the people crowding round the tent began protesting.
Holofernes’ own senior officers, as well as all the coastal peoples and the Moabites, threatened to tear him limb
from limb.

Jdt 5:23 “Why should we be afraid of the Israelites? They are a weak and powerless people, quite unable to
stand a stiff attack.

Jdt 5:24 Forward! Advance! Your army, Holofernes our master, will swallow them in one mouthful!”.

Jdt 6:1 When the uproar of those crowding round the council had subsided, Holofernes, general-in-chief of the
Assyrian army, reprimanded Achior in front of the whole crowd of foreigners and Ammonites.

Jdt 6:2 “Achior, who do you think you are, you and the Ephraimite mercenaries, playing the prophet like this with
us today, and trying to dissuade us from making war on the people of Israel? You claim their God will protect
them. And who is God if not Nebuchadnezzar? He himself will display his power and wipe them off the face of
the earth, and their God will certainly not save them.

Jdt 6:3 But we, his servants, shall destroy them as easily as a single individual. They can never resist the
strength of our cavalry.

Jdt 6:4 We shall burn them all. Their mountains will be drunk with their blood and their plains filled with their
corpses. Far from being able to resist us, every one of them will die; thus says King Nebuchadnezzar, lord of the
whole world. For he has spoken, and his words will not prove empty.

Jdt 6:5 As for you, Achior, you Ammonite mercenary, who in a rash moment said these words, you will not see
my face again until the day when I have taken my revenge on this brood from Egypt.

Jdt 6:6 And then the swords of my soldiers and the spears of my officers will pierce your sides. You will fall
among their wounded, the moment I turn on Israel.

Jdt 6:7 My servants will now take you into the hill-country and leave you near one of the towns in the passes;

Jdt 6:8 you will not die, until you share their ruin.

Jdt 6:9 No need to look so sad if you cherish the secret hope that they will not be captured! I have spoken; none
of my words will prove idle”.

Jdt 6:10 Holofernes having commanded his tent-orderlies to seize Achior, to take him to Bethulia and to hand
him over to the Israelites,

Jdt 6:1 1 the orderlies took him, escorted him out of the camp and across the plain, and then, making for the hill-
country, reached the springs below Bethulia.

Jdt 6:12 As soon as the men of the town sighted them, they snatched up their weapons, left the town and made
for the mountain tops, while all the slingers pelted them with stones to prevent them from coming up.



Jdt 6:13 However, they managed to take cover at the foot of the slope, where they bound Achior and left him
lying at the bottom of the mountain and returned to their master.

Jdt 6:14 The Israelites then came down from their town, stopped by him, unbound him and took him to Bethulia,
where they brought him before the chief men of the town,

Jdt 6:15 who at that time were Uzziah son of Micah of the tribe of Simeon, Chabris son of Gothoniel and
Charmis son of Melchiel.

Jdt 6:16 These summoned all the elders of the town. The young men and the women also hurried to the
assembly. Achior was made to stand with all the people surrounding him, and Uzziah questioned him about what
had happened.

Jdt 6:17 He answered by telling them what had been said at Holofernes’ council, and what he himself had said
in the presence of the Assyrian leaders, and how Holofernes had bragged of what he would do to the House of
Israel.

Jdt 6:18 At this the people fell to the ground and worshipped God.

Jdt 6:19 “Lord God of heaven”, they cried, “take notice of their arrogance and have pity on the humiliation of our
race. Look kindly today on those who are consecrated to you”.

Jdt 6:20 They then spoke reässuringly to Achior and praised him warmly.

Jdt 6:21 After the assembly Uzziah took him home and gave a banquet for the elders; all that night they called
on the God of Israel for help.

Jdt 7:1 The following day Holofernes issued orders to his whole army and to the whole host of auxiliaries who
had joined him, to break camp and march on Bethulia, to occupy the mountain passes and so open the
campaign against the Israelites.

Jdt 7:2 The troops broke camp that same day. The actual fighting force numbered one hundred and twenty
thousand infantry and twelve thousand cavalry, not to mention the baggage train with the vast number of men on
foot concerned with that.

Jdt 7:3 They penetrated the valley in the neighbourhood of Bethulia, near the spring, and deployed on a wide
front from Dothan to Balbaim and, in depth, from Bethulia to Cyamon, which faces Esdraelon.

Jdt 7:4 When the Israelites saw this horde, they were all appalled and said to each other, “Now they will lick the
whole country clean. Not even the loftiest peaks, the gorges or the hills will be able to stand the weight of them”.
Jdt 7:5 Each man snatched up his arms; they lit beacons on their towers and spent the whole night on watch.

Jdt 7:6 On the second day Holofernes deployed his entire cavalry in sight of the Israelites in Bethulia.

Jdt 7:7 He reconnoitred the slopes leading up to the town, located the water-points, seized them and posted
pickets over them and returned to the main body.

Jdt 7:8 The chieftains of the sons of Esau, all the leaders of the Moabites and the generals of the coastal district
then came to him and said,

Jdt 7:9 “If our master will be pleased to listen to us, his forces will not sustain a single wound.

Jdt 7:10 These Israelites do not rely so much on their spears as on the height of the mountains where they live.
And admittedly it is not at all easy to scale these heights of theirs.

Jdt 7:1 1 “This being the case, master, avoid engaging them in a pitched battle and then you will not lose a single
man.

Jdt 7:12 Stay in camp, keep all your troops there too, while your servants seize the spring which rises at the foot
of the mountain,

Jdt 7:13 since that is what provides the population of Bethulia with their water supply. Thirst will then force them
to surrender their town. Meanwhile, we and our men will climb the nearest mountain tops and form advance
posts there to prevent anyone from leaving the town.

Jdt 7:14 Hunger will waste them, with their wives and children, and before the sword can reach them they will
already be lying in the streets outside their houses.

Jdt 7:15 And you will make them pay dearly for their defiance and their refusal to meet you peaceably”.

Jdt 7:16 Their words pleased Holofernes as well as all his officers, and he decided to do as they suggested.

Jdt 7:17 Accordingly, a troop of Moabites moved forward with a further five thousand Assyrians. They
penetrated the valley and seized the Israelites’ waterpoints and springs.

Jdt 7:18 Meanwhile the Edomites and Ammonites went and took up positions in the highlands opposite Dothan,
sending some of their men to the south-east opposite Egrebel near Chous on the Wadi Mochmur. The rest of the
Assyrian army took up positions in the plain, covering every inch of the ground; their tents and equipment made
an immense encampment, so vast were their numbers.

Jdt 7:19 The Israelites called on the Lord their God, dispirited because the enemy had surrounded them and cut
all line of retreat.

Jdt 7:20 For thirty-four days the Assyrian army, infantry, chariots, cavalrymen, had them surrounded. Every
water-jar the inhabitants of Bethulia had was empty,

Jdt 7:21 their storage-wells were drying up; on no day could a man drink his fill, since their water was rationed.



Jdt 7:22 Their little children pined away, the women and young men grew weak with thirst; they collapsed in the
streets and gateways of the town; they had no strength left.

Jdt 7:23 Young men, women, children, the whole people thronged clamouring round Uzziah and the chief men
of the town, shouting in the presence of the assembled elders,

Jdt 7:24 “May God be judge between you and us! For you have done us great harm, by not suing for peace with
the Assyrians.

Jdt 7:25 And now there is no one to help us. God has delivered us into their hands to be prostrated before them
in thirst and utter helplessness.

Jdt 7:26 Call them in at once; hand the whole town over to be sacked by Holofernes’ men and all his army.

Jdt 7:27 After all, we should be much better off as their booty than we are now; no doubt we shall be enslaved,
but at least we shall be alive and not see our little ones dying before our eyes or our wives and children
perishing.

Jdt 7:28 By heaven and earth and by our God, the Lord of our fathers, who is punishing us for our sins and the
sins of our ancestors, we implore you to take this course now, today”.

Jdt 7:29 Bitter lamentations rose from the whole assembly, and they all cried loudly to the Lord God.

Jdt 7:30 Then Uzziah spoke to them, “Take heart, brothers! Let us hold out five days more. By then the Lord our
God will take pity on us, for he will not desert us altogether.

Jdt 7:31 At the end of this time, if no help is forthcoming, I shall do as you have said”.

Jdt 7:32 With that he dismissed the people to their various quarters. The men went to man the walls and towers
of the town, sending the women and children home. The town was full of despondency.

Jdt 8:1 Judith was informed at the time of what had happened. She was the daughter of Merari son of Ox, son
of Joseph, son of Oziel, son of Elkiah, son of Ananias, son of Gideon, son of Raphaim, son of Ahitub, son of
Elijah, son of Hilkiah, son of Eliab, son of Nathanael, son of Salamiel, son of Sarasadai, son of Israel.

Jdt 8:2 Her husband Manasseh, of her own tribe and family, had died at the time of the barley harvest.

Jdt 8:3 He was supervising the men as they bound up the sheaves in the field when he caught sunstroke and
had to take to his bed. He died in Bethulia, his home town, and was buried with his ancestors in the field that lies
between Dothan and Balamon.

Jdt 8:4 As a widow, Judith stayed inside her home for three years and four months.

Jdt 8:5 She had had an upper room built for herself on the roof. She wore sackcloth next to the skin and
dressed in widow’s weeds.

Jdt 8:6 She fasted every day of her widowhood except for the Sabbath eve, the Sabbath itself, the eve of New
Moon, the feast of New Moon and the joyful festivals of the House of Israel.

Jdt 8:7 Now she was very beautiful, charming to see. Her husband Manasseh had left her gold and silver,
menservants and maidservants, herds and land; and she lived among all her possessions
Jdt 8:8 without anyone finding a word to say against her, so devoutly did she fear God.

Jdt 8:9 Hearing how the water shortage had demoralised the people and how they had complained bitterly to
the headman of the town, and being also told what Uzziah had said to them and how he had given them his oath
to surrender the town to the Assyrians in five days’ time,

Jdt 8:10 Judith immediately sent the serving-woman who ran her household to summon Chabris and Charmis,
two elders of the town.

Jdt 8:1 1 When these came in she said: “Listen to me, leaders of the people of Bethulia. You were wrong to
speak to the people as you did today and to bind yourself by oath, in defiance of God, to surrender the town to
our enemies if the Lord did not come to your help within a set number of days.

Jdt 8:12 Who are you, to put God to the test today, you, of all people, to set yourselves above him?

Jdt 8:13 You put the Lord Almighty to the test! You do not understand anything, and never will.

Jdt 8:14 If you cannot sound the depths of the human heart or unravel the arguments of the human mind, how
can you fathom the God who made all things, or sound his mind or unravel his purposes? No, brothers, do not
provoke the anger of the Lord our God.

Jdt 8:15 Although it may not be his will to help us within the next five days, he has the power to protect us for as
many days as he pleases, just as he has the power to destroy us before our enemies.

Jdt 8:16 But you have no right to demand guarantees where the designs of the Lord our God are concerned.

For God is not to be threatened as a human being is, nor is he, like a mere human, to be cajoled.

Jdt 8:17 Rather, as we wait patiently for him to save, let us plead with him to help us. He will hear our voice if
such is his good pleasure.

Jdt 8:18 “And indeed of recent times and still today there is not one tribe of ours, or family, or village, or town
that has worshipped gods made by human hand, as once was done,

Jdt 8:19 which was the reason why our ancestors were delivered over to sword and sack, and perished in
misery at the hands of our enemies.

Jdt 8:20 We for our part acknowledge no other God but him; and so we may hope he will not look on us



disdainfully or desert our nation.

Jdt 8:21 “If indeed they capture us, as you expect, then all Judaea will be captured too, and our holy places
plundered, and we shall answer with our blood for their profanation.

Jdt 8:22 The slaughter of our brothers, the captivity of our country, the unpeopling of our heritage, will recoil on
our own heads among the nations whose slaves we shall become, and our new masters will look down on us as
an outrage and a disgrace;

Jdt 8:23 for our surrender will not reinstate us in their favour; no, the Lord our God will make it a thing to be
ashamed of.

Jdt 8:24 So now, brothers, let us set an example to our brothers, since their lives depend on us, and the
sanctuary — Temple and altar — rests on us.

Jdt 8:25 “All this being so, let us rather give thanks to the Lord our God who, as he tested our ancestors, is now
testing us.

Jdt 8:26 Remember how he treated Abraham, all the ordeals of Isaac, all that happened to Jacob in Syrian
Mesopotamia while he kept the sheep of Laban, his mother’s brother.

Jdt 8:27 For as these ordeals were intended by him to search their hearts, so now this is not vengeance that
God is exacting on us, but a warning inflicted by the Lord on those who are near his heart”.

Jdt 8:28 Uzziah replied, “Everything you have just said comes from an honest heart and no one will contradict a
word of it.

Jdt 8:29 Not that today is the first time your wisdom has been displayed; from your earliest years all the people
have known how shrewd you are and of how sound a heart.

Jdt 8:30 But, parched with thirst, the people forced us to act as we had promised them and to bind ourselves by
an inviolable oath.

Jdt 8:31 You are a devout woman; pray to the Lord, then, to send us a downpour to fill our storage-wells, so that
our faintness may pass”.

Jdt 8:32 Judith replied, “Listen to me, I intend to do something, the memory of which will be handed down to the
children of our race from age to age.

Jdt 8:33 Tonight you must be at the gate of the town. I shall make my way out with my attendant. Before the
time fixed by you for surrendering the town to our enemies, the Lord will make use of me to rescue Israel.

Jdt 8:34 You must not ask what I intend to do; I shall not tell you until I have done it”.

Jdt 8:35 Uzziah and the chief men said, “Go in peace. May the Lord show you a way to take revenge on our
enemies”.

Jdt 8:36 And leaving the upper room they went back to their posts.

Jdt 9:1 Judith threw herself face to the ground, scattered ashes on her head, undressed as far as the sackcloth
she was wearing and cried loudly to the Lord. At the same time in Jerusalem the evening incense was being
offered in the Temple of God. Judith said:

Jdt 9:2 Lord, God of my ancestor Simeon, you armed him with a sword to take vengeance on the foreigners who
had undone a virgin’s belt to her shame, laid bare her thigh to her confusion, violated her womb to her
dishonour, since, though you said, “This must not be”, they did it.

Jdt 9:3 For this you handed their leaders over to slaughter, and their bed, defiled by their treachery, was itself
betrayed in blood. You struck the slaves with the chieftains and the chieftains with their retainers.

Jdt 9:4 You left their wives to be carried off, their daughters to be taken captive, and their spoils to be shared out
among the sons you loved, who had been so zealous for you, had loathed the stain put on their blood and called
on you for help. O God, my God, now hear this widow too;

Jdt 9:5 for you have made the past, and what is happening now, and what will follow. What is, what will be, you
have planned; what has been, you designed.

Jdt 9:6 Your purposes stood forward; “See, here we are!”. they said. For all your ways are prepared and your
judgements delivered with foreknowledge.

Jdt 9:7 See the Assyrians, with their army abounding glorying in their horses and their riders, exulting in the
strength of their infantry. Trust as they may in shield and spear, in bow and sling, in you they have not
recognised the Lord, the breaker of battle-lines;

Jdt 9:8 yours alone is the title of Lord. Break their violence with your might, in your anger bring down their
strength. For they plan to profane your holy places, to defile the tabernacle, the resting place of your glorious
name, and to hack down the horn of your altar.

Jdt 9:9 Observe their arrogance, send your fury on their heads, give the strength I have in mind to this widow’s
hand.

Jdt 9:10 By guile of my lips strike down slave with master, and master with retainer. Break their pride by a
woman’s hand.

Jdt 9:1 1 Your strength does not lie in numbers, nor your might in strong men; since you are the God of the
humble, the help of the oppressed, the support of the weak, the refuge of the forsaken, the Saviour of the



despairing.

Jdt 9:12 Please, please, God of my father, God of the heritage of Israel, Master of heaven and earth, Creator of
the waters, King of your whole creation, hear my prayer.

Jdt 9:13 Give me a beguiling tongue to wound and kill those who have formed such cruel designs against your
covenant, against your holy dwelling-place, against Mount Zion, against the house belonging to your sons.

Jdt 9:14 And demonstrate to every nation, every tribe, that you are the Lord, God of all power, all might, and that
the race of Israel has no protector but you.

Jdt 10:1 Thus Judith called on the God of Israel. When she had finished praying,

Jdt 10:2 she got up from the floor, summoned her maid and went down into the rooms which she used on
Sabbath days and festivals.

Jdt 10:3 There she removed the sackcloth she was wearing and taking off her widow’s dress, she washed all
over, anointed herself plentifully with perfumes, dressed her hair, wrapped a turban round it and put on the robe
of joy she used to wear when her husband Manasseh was alive.

Jdt 10:4 She put sandals on her feet, put on her necklaces, bracelets, rings, earrings and all her jewellery, and
made herself beautiful enough to beguile the eye of any man who saw her.

Jdt 10:5 Then she handed her maid a skin of wine and a flask of oil, filled a bag with barley girdle-cakes, cakes
of dried fruit and pure loaves, and wrapping all these provisions up gave them to her as well.

Jdt 10:6 They then went out, making for the town gate of Bethulia. There they found Uzziah waiting with the two
elders of the town, Chabris and Charmis.

Jdt 10:7 When they saw Judith, her face so changed and her clothes so different, they were lost in admiration of
her beauty. They said to her:

Jdt 10:8 May the God of our ancestors keep you in his favour! May he crown your designs with success to the
glory of the children of Israel, to the greater glory of Jerusalem!

Jdt 10:9 Judith worshipped God, and then she said, “Have the town gate opened for me so that I can go out and
fulfil all the wishes you expressed to me”. They did as she asked and gave orders to the young men to open the
gate for her.

Jdt 10:10 This done, Judith went out accompanied by her maid, while the men of the town watched her all the
way down the mountain and across the valley, until they lost sight of her.

Jdt 10:1 1 As the women were making straight through the valley, an advance unit of Assyrians intercepted
them,

Jdt 10:12 and, seizing Judith, began to question her. “Which side are you on? Where do you come from? Where
are you going?”. “I am a daughter of the Hebrews”, she replied, “and I am fleeing from them since they will soon be
your prey.

Jdt 10:13 I am on my way to see Holofernes, the general of your army, to give him trustworthy information. I
shall show him the road to take if he wants to capture all the hill-country without losing one man or one life”.

Jdt 10:14 As the men listened to what she was saying, they stared in astonishment at the sight of such a
beautiful woman.

Jdt 10:15 “It will prove the saving of you”, they said to her, “coming down to see our master of your own accord.
You had better go to his tent; some of our men will escort you and hand you over to him.

Jdt 10:16 Once you are in his presence do not be afraid. Tell him what you have just told us and you will be well
treated”.

Jdt 10:17 They then detailed a hundred of their men as escort for herself and her attendant, and these led them
to the tent of Holofernes.

Jdt 10:18 News of her coming had already spread through the tents, and there was a general stir in the camp.
She was still outside the tent of Holofernes waiting to be announced, when a crowd began forming round her.

Jdt 10:19 They were immediately impressed by her beauty and impressed with the Israelites because of her.
“Who could despise a people who have women like this?”. they kept saying. “Better not leave one of them alive;
let any go and they could twist the whole world round their fingers!”.

Jdt 10:20 The bodyguard and adjutants of Holofernes then came out and led Judith into the tent.

Jdt 10:21 Holofernes was resting on his bed under a canopy of purple and gold studded with emeralds and
precious stones.

Jdt 10:22 The men announced her and he came out to the entrance to the tent, with silver torches carried
before him.

Jdt 10:23 When Judith confronted the general and his adjutant, the beauty of her face astonished them all. She
fell on her face and did homage to him, but his servants raised her from the ground.

Jdt 1 1:1 “Courage, woman”, Holofernes said, “do not be afraid. I have never hurt anyone who chose to serve
Nebuchadnezzar, king of the whole world.

Jdt 1 1 :2 Even now, if your nation of mountain dwellers had not insulted me, I would not have raised a spear
against them. This was their fault, not mine.



Jdt 1 1 :3 But tell me, why have you fled from them and come to us? … Anyhow, this will prove the saving of
you. Courage! You will live through this night, and many after.

Jdt 1 1 :4 No one will hurt you. On the contrary, you will be treated as well as any who serve my lord King
Nebuchadnezzar”.

Jdt 1 1 :5 Judith said, “Please listen favourably to what your slave has to say. Permit your servant to speak in
your presence, I shall speak no word of a lie to my lord tonight.

Jdt 1 1 :6 You have only to follow your servant’s advice and God will bring your work to a successful conclusion;
in what my lord undertakes he will not fail.

Jdt 1 1 :7 Long life to Nebuchadnezzar, king of the whole world, who has sent you to set every living soul to
rights; may his power endure! Since, thanks to you, he is served not only by human beings, but because of your
might the wild animals themselves, the cattle, and the birds of the air are to live in the service of
Nebuchadnezzar and his whole House.

Jdt 1 1 :8 “We have indeed heard of your genius and adroitness of mind. It is known everywhere in the world that
throughout the empire you have no rival for ability, wealth of experience and brilliance in waging war.

Jdt 1 1 :9 We have also heard what Achior said in his speech to your council. The men of Bethulia having spared
him, he has told them everything that he said to you.

Jdt 11:10 Now, master and lord, do not disregard what he said; keep it in your mind, since it is true; our nation
will not be punished, the sword will indeed have no power over them, unless they sin against their God.

Jdt 11:11 But as it is, my lord need expect no repulse or setback, since death is about to fall on their heads, for
sin has gained a hold over them, provoking the anger of their God each time that they commit it.

Jdt 1 1:12 As they are short of food and their water is giving out, they have resolved to fall back on their cattle
and decided to make use of all the things that God has, by his laws, forbidden them to eat.

Jdt 11:13 Not only have they made up their minds to eat the first-fruits of corn and the tithes of wine and oil,
though these have been consecrated by them and set apart for the priests who serve in Jerusalem in the
presence of our God, and may not lawfully even be handled by ordinary people,

Jdt 11:14 but they have sent men to Jerusalem — where the inhabitants are doing much the same — to bring
them back authorisation from the Council of Elders.

Jdt 1 1:15 Now this will be the outcome: when the permission arrives and they act on it, that very day they will be
delivered over to you for destruction.

Jdt 11:16 “When I, your servant, came to know all this, I fled from them. God has sent me to do things with you
at which the world will be astonished when it hears.

Jdt 1 1:17 Your servant is a devout woman; she honours the God of heaven day and night. I therefore propose,
my lord, to stay with you. I, your servant, shall go out every night into the valley and pray to God to let me know
when they have committed their sin.

Jdt 11:18 I shall then come and tell you, so that you can march out with your whole army; and none of them will
be able to resist you.

Jdt 1 1:19 I shall be your guide right across Judaea until you reach Jerusalem; there I shall enthrone you in the
very middle of the city. And then you can round them up like shepherd-less sheep, with never a dog daring to
bark at you. Foreknowledge tells me this; this has been foretold to me and I have been sent to reveal it to you”.
Jdt 1 1 :20 Her words pleased Holofernes, and all his adjutants. Full of admiration at her wisdom they exclaimed,
Jdt 1 1 :21 “There is no woman like her from one end of the earth to the other, so lovely of face and so wise of
speech!”.

Jdt 1 1 :22 Holofernes said, “God has done well to send you ahead of the others. Strength will be ours, and ruin
theirs who have insulted my lord.

Jdt 1 1 :23 As for you, you are as beautiful as you are eloquent; if you do as you have promised, your God shall
be my God, and you yourself shall make your home in the palace of King Nebuchadnezzar and be famous
throughout the world”.

Jdt 12:1 With that he had her brought in to where his silver dinner service was already laid, and had his own
food served to her and his own wine poured out for her.

Jdt 12:2 But Judith said, “I would rather not eat this, in case I incur some fault. What I have brought will be
enough for me”.

Jdt 12:3 “Suppose your provisions run out”, Holofernes asked, “how could we get more of the same sort? We
have no one belonging to your race here”.

Jdt 12:4 “May your soul live, my lord”, Judith answered, “the Lord will have used me to accomplish his plan,
before your servant has finished these provisions”.

Jdt 12:5 Holofernes’ adjutants then took her to a tent where she slept until midnight. A little before the morning
watch, she got up.

Jdt 12:6 She had already sent this request to Holofernes, “Let my lord kindly give orders for your servant to be
allowed to go out and pray”,



Jdt 12:7 and Holofernes had ordered his guards not to prevent her. She stayed in the camp for three days; she
went out each night to the valley of Bethulia and washed at the spring where the picket had been posted.

Jdt 12:8 As she went she prayed to the Lord God of Israel to guide her in her plan to relieve the children of her
people.

Jdt 12:9 Having purified herself, she would return and stay in her tent until her meal was brought her in the
evening.

Jdt 12:10 On the fourth day Holofernes gave a banquet, inviting only his own staff and none of the other officers.
Jdt 12:11 He said to Bagoas, the officer in charge of his personal affairs, “Go and persuade that Hebrew woman
you are looking after to come and join us and eat and drink in our company.

Jdt 12:12 We shall be disgraced if we let a woman like this go without seducing her. If we do not seduce her,
everyone will laugh at us!”.

Jdt 12:13 Bagoas then left Holofernes and went to see Judith. “Would this young and lovely woman condescend
to come to my lord?”. he asked. “She will occupy the seat of honour opposite him, drink the joyful wine with us
and be treated today like one of the Assyrian ladies who stand in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar”.

Jdt 12:14 “Who am I”, Judith replied, “to resist my lord? I shall not hesitate to do whatever he wishes, and doing
this will be my joy to my dying day”.

Jdt 12:15 So she got up and put on her dress and all her feminine adornments. Her maid preceded her, and on
the floor in front of Holofernes spread the fleece which Bagoas had given Judith for her daily use to lie on as she
ate.

Jdt 12:16 Judith came in and took her place. The heart of Holofernes was ravished at the sight; his very soul
was stirred. He was seized with a violent desire to sleep with her; and indeed since the first day he saw her, he
had been waiting for an opportunity to seduce her.

Jdt 12:17 “Drink then!”. Holofernes said. “Enjoy yourself with us!”.

Jdt 12:18 “I am delighted to do so, my lord, for since my birth I have never felt my life more worthwhile than
today”.

Jdt 12:19 She took what her maid had prepared, and ate and drank facing him.

Jdt 12:20 Holofernes was so enchanted with her that he drank far more wine than he had drunk on any other
day in his life.

Jdt 13:1 It grew late and his staff hurried away. Bagoas closed the tent from the outside, having shown out
those who still lingered in his lord’s presence. They went to their beds wearied with too much drinking,

Jdt 13:2 and Judith was left alone in the tent with Holofernes who had collapsed wine-sodden on his bed.

Jdt 1 3:3 Judith then told her maid to stay just outside the bedroom and wait for her to come out, as she did
every morning. She had let it be understood she would be going out to her prayers and had also spoken of her
intention to Bagoas.

Jdt 13:4 By now everyone had left Holofernes, and no one, either important or unimportant, was left in the
bedroom. Standing beside the bed, Judith murmured to herself: Lord God, to whom all strength belongs, prosper
what my hands are now to do for the greater glory of Jerusalem;

Jdt 13:5 now is the time to recover your heritage and to further my plans to crush the enemies arrayed against
us.

Jdt 13:6 With that she went up to the bedpost by Holofernes’ head and took down his scimitar;

Jdt 1 3:7 coming closer to the bed she caught him by the hair and said, “Make me strong today, Lord God of
Israel!”.

Jdt 1 3:8 Twice she struck at his neck with all her might, and cut off his head.

Jdt 13:9 She then rolled his body off the bed and pulled down the canopy from the bedposts. After which, she
went out and gave the head of Holofernes to her maid

Jdt 13:10 who put it in her food bag. The two then left the camp together, as they always did when they went to
pray. Once they were out of the camp, they skirted the ravine, climbed the slope to Bethulia and made for the
gates.

Jdt 13:1 1 From a distance, Judith shouted to the guards on the gates, “Open the gate! Open! For the Lord our
God is with us still, displaying his strength in Israel and his might against our enemies, as he has done today!”.

Jdt 13:12 Hearing her voice, the townsmen hurried down to the town gate and summoned the elders.

Jdt 13:13 Everyone, great and small, came running down, since her arrival was unexpected. They threw the
gate open, welcomed the women, lit a fire to see by and crowded round them.

Jdt 13:14 Then Judith raised her voice and said, “Praise God! Praise him! Praise the God who has not
withdrawn his mercy from the House of Israel, but has shattered our enemies by my hand tonight!”.

Jdt 13:15 She pulled the head out of the bag and held it for them to see. “This is the head of Holofernes,
general-in-chief of the Assyrian army; here is the canopy under which he lay drunk! The Lord has struck him
down by the hand of a woman!

Jdt 13:16 Glory to the Lord who has protected me in the course I took! My face seduced him, only to his own



undoing; he committed no sin with me to shame me or disgrace me”.

Jdt 13:17 Overcome with emotion, the people all prostrated themselves and worshipped God, exclaiming with
one voice, “Blessings on you, our God, for confounding your people’s enemies today!”.

Jdt 13:18 Uzziah then said to Judith: May you be blessed, my daughter, by God Most High, beyond all women
on earth; and blessed be the Lord God, Creator of heaven and earth, who guided you to cut off the head of the
leader of our enemies!

Jdt 13:19 The trust which you have shown will not pass from human hearts, as they commemorate the power of
God for evermore.

Jdt 13:20 God grant you may be always held in honour and rewarded with blessings, since you did not consider
your own life when our nation was brought to its knees, but warded off our ruin, walking in the right path before
our God. And the people all said, “Amen! Amen!”.

Jdt 14:1 Judith said, “Listen to me, brothers. Take this head and hang it on your battlements.

Jdt 14:2 When morning comes and the sun is up, let every man take his arms and every able-bodied man leave
the town. Appoint a leader for them, as if you meant to march down to the plain against the Assyrian advanced
post. But you must not do this.

Jdt 14:3 The Assyrians will gather up their equipment, make for their camp and wake up their commanders; they
in turn will rush to the tent of Holofernes and not be able to find him. They will then be seized with panic and flee
at your advance.

Jdt 14:4 All you and the others who live in the territory of Israel will have to do is to give chase and slaughter
them as they retreat.

Jdt 14:5 “But before you do this, call me Achior the Ammonite, for him to see and identify the man who held the
House of Israel in contempt, the man who sent him to us as someöne already doomed to die”.

Jdt 14:6 So they had Achior brought from Uzziah’s house. No sooner had he arrived and seen the head of
Holofernes held by a member of the people’s assembly than he fell on his face in a faint.

Jdt 14:7 They lifted him up. He then threw himself at Judith’s feet and, prostrate before her, exclaimed: May you
be blessed in all the tents of Judah and in every nation; those who hear your name will be seized with dread!

Jdt 14:8 “Now tell me everything that you have done in these past few days”. And surrounded by the people,
Judith told him everything she had done from the day she left Bethulia to the moment when she was speaking.
Jdt 14:9 When she came to the end, the people cheered at the top of their voices until the town echoed.

Jdt 14:10 Achior, recognising all that the God of Israel had done, believed ardently in him and, accepting
circumcision, was permanently incorporated into the House of Israel.

Jdt 14:1 1 At daybreak they hung the head of Holofernes on the ramparts. Every man took his arms and they all
went out in groups to the slopes of the mountain.

Jdt 14:12 Seeing this, the Assyrians sent word to their leaders, who in turn reported to the generals, the
captains of thousands and all the other officers;

Jdt 14:13 and these in their turn reported to the tent of Holofernes. “Rouse our master”, they said to his major-
domo, “these slaves have dared to march down on us to attack - and to be wiped out to a man!”.

Jdt 14:14 Bagoas went inside and struck the curtain dividing the tent, thinking that Holofernes was sleeping with
Judith.

Jdt 14:15 But as no one seemed to hear, he drew the curtain and went into the bedroom, to find him thrown
down dead on the threshold, with his head cut off.

Jdt 14:16 He gave a great shout, wept, sobbed, shrieked and rent his clothes.

Jdt 14:17 He then went into the tent which Judith had occupied and could not find her either. Then, rushing out
to the men, he shouted,

Jdt 14:18 “The slaves have rebelled! A single Hebrew woman has brought shame on the House of
Nebuchadnezzar. Holofernes is lying dead on the ground, without his head!”.

Jdt 14:19 When they heard this, the leaders of the Assyrian army tore their tunics in consternation, and the
camp rang with their wild cries and their shouting.

Jdt 15:1 When the men who were still in their tents heard the news they were appalled.

Jdt 15:2 Panic-stricken and trembling, no two of them could keep together, the rout was complete, with one
accord they fled along every track across the plain or through the mountains.

Jdt 15:3 The men who had been bivouacking in the mountains round Bethulia were fleeing too. Then all the
Israelite warriors charged down on them.

Jdt 15:4 Uzziah sent messengers to Betomasthaim, Bebai, Choba, Kola, throughout the whole territory of Israel,
to inform them of what had happened and to urge them all to hurl themselves on the enemy and annihilate them.
Jdt 15:5 As soon as the Israelites heard the news, they fell on them as one man and massacred them all the
way to Choba. The men of Jerusalem and the entire mountain country also rallied to them, once they had been
informed of the events in the enemy camp. Then the men of Gilead and Galilee attacked them on the flank and
struck at them fiercely till they neared Damascus and its territory.



Jdt 15:6 All the other inhabitants of Bethulia fell on the Assyrian camp and looted it to their great profit.

Jdt 15:7 The Israelites returning from the slaughter seized what was left. The hamlets and villages of the
mountain country and the plain also captured a great deal of booty, since there were vast stores of it.

Jdt 15:8 Joakim the high priest and the entire Council of Elders of Israel, who were in Jerusalem, came to gaze
on the benefits that the Lord had lavished on Israel and to see Judith and congratulate her.

Jdt 15:9 On coming to her house, they blessed her with one accord, saying: You are the glory of Jerusalem!

You are the great pride of Israel! You are the highest honour of our race!

Jdt 15:10 By doing all this with your own hand you have deserved well of Israel, and God has approved what
you have done. May you be blessed by the Lord Almighty in all the days to come! And the people all said,

“Amen!”.

Jdt 15:1 1 The people looted the camp for thirty days. They gave Judith the tent of Holofernes, all his silver plate,
his divans, his drinking bowls and all his furniture. She took this, loaded her mule, harnessed her carts and
heaped the things into them.

Jdt 15:12 All the women of Israel, hurrying to see her, formed choirs of dancers in her honour. Judith took
wands of vine-leaves in her hand and distributed them to the women who accompanied her;

Jdt 15:13 she and her companions put on wreaths of olive. Then she took her place at the head of the
procession and led the women as they danced. All the men of Israel, armed and garlanded, followed them,
singing hymns.

Jdt 15:14 With all Israel round her, Judith broke into this song of thanksgiving and the whole people sang this
hymn:

Jdt 16:1 Break into song for my God, to the tambourine, sing in honour of the Lord, to the cymbal, let psalm and
canticle mingle for him, extol his name, invoke it!

Jdt 16:2 For the Lord is a God who breaks battle-lines; he has pitched his camp in the middle of his people to
deliver me from the hands of my oppressors.

Jdt 16:3 Assyria came down from the mountains of the north, came with tens of thousands of his army. Their
multitude blocked the ravines, their horses covered the hills.

Jdt 16:4 He threatened to burn up my country, destroy my young men with the sword, dash my sucklings to the
ground, make prey of my little ones, carry off my maidens;

Jdt 16:5 but the Lord Almighty has thwarted them by a woman’s hand.

Jdt 16:6 For their hero did not fall at the young men’s hands, it was not the sons of Titans struck him down, no
proud giants made that attack, but Judith, the daughter of Merari, who disarmed him with the beauty of her face.
Jdt 16:7 She laid aside her widow’s dress to raise up those who were oppressed in Israel; she anointed her face
with perfume,

Jdt 16:8 bound her hair under a turban, put on a linen gown to seduce him.

Jdt 16:9 Her sandal ravished his eye, her beauty took his soul prisoner and the scimitar cut through his neck!

Jdt 16:10 The Persians trembled at her boldness, the Medes were daunted by her daring.

Jdt 16:1 1 These were struck with fear when my lowly ones raised the war cry, these were seized with terror
when my weak ones shouted, and when they raised their voices these gave ground.

Jdt 16:12 The children of mere girls ran them through, pierced them like the offspring of deserters. They
perished in the battle of my Lord!

Jdt 16:13 I shall sing a new song to my God. Lord, you are great, you are glorious, wonderfully strong,
unconquerable.

Jdt 16:14 May your whole creation serve you! For you spoke and things came into being, you sent your breath
and they were put together, and no one can resist your voice.

Jdt 16:15 Should mountains be tossed from their foundations to mingle with the waves, should rocks melt like
wax before your face, to those who fear you, you would still be merciful.

Jdt 16:16 A little thing indeed is a sweetly smelling sacrifice, still less the fat burned for you in burnt offering; but
whoëver fears the Lord is great for ever.

Jdt 16:17 Woe to the nations who rise against my race! The Lord Almighty will punish them on judgement day.
He will send fire and worms in their flesh and they will weep with pain for evermore.

Jdt 16:18 When they reached Jerusalem they fell on their faces before God and, once the people had been
purified, they presented their burnt offerings, voluntary offerings and gifts.

Jdt 16:19 All Holofernes’ property given her by the people, and the canopy she herself had stripped from his
bed, Judith vowed to God as a dedicated offering.

Jdt 16:20 For three months the people gave themselves up to rejoicings in front of the Temple in Jerusalem,
where Judith stayed with them.

Jdt 16:21 When this was over, everyone returned home. Judith went back to Bethulia and lived on her property;
as long as she lived, she enjoyed a great reputation throughout the country.

Jdt 16:22 She had many suitors, but all her days, from the time her husband Manasseh died and was gathered



to his people, she never gave herself to another man.

Jdt 16:23 Her fame spread more and more, the older she grew in her husband’s house; she lived to the age of
one hundred and five. She emancipated her maid, then died in Bethulia and was buried in the cave where
Manasseh her husband lay.

Jdt 16:24 The House of Israel mourned her for seven days. Before her death she had distributed her property
among her own relations and those of her husband Manasseh.

Jdt 16:25 Never again during the lifetime of Judith, nor indeed for a long time after her death, did anyone trouble
the Israelites.

Est 1:1 It was in the days of Ahasuerus, the Ahasuerus whose empire stretched from India to Ethiopia and
comprised one hundred and twenty-seven provinces, (a) In the second year of the reign of the Great King,
Ahasuerus, on the first day of Nisan, a dream came to Mordecai son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, of the
tribe of Benjamin, (b) a Jew living at Susa and holding high office at the royal court, (c) He was one of the
captives whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had deported from Jerusalem with Jeconiah king of Judah, (d)
This was his dream. There were cries and noise, thunder and earthquakes, and disorder over the whole earth.

(e) Then two great dragons came forward, each ready for the fray, and set up a great roar, (f) At the sound of
them every nation made ready to wage war against the nation of the just, (g) A day of darkness and gloom, of
affliction and distress, oppression and great disturbance on earth! (h) The entire upright nation was thrown into
consternation at the fear of the evils awaiting it and prepared for death, crying out to God. (i) Then from its cry,
as from a little spring, there grew a great river, a flood of water, (j) Light came as the sun rose, and the humble
were raised up and devoured the mighty, (k) On awakening from this dream and vision of God’s designs,
Mordecai thought deeply about the matter, trying his best all day to discover what its meaning might be. (I)
Mordecai was lodging at court with Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs who guarded the palace, (m)
Having got wind of their plotting and gained knowledge of their designs, he discovered that they were preparing
to assassinate King Ahasuerus, and he warned the king against them, (n) The king gave orders for the two
officers to be tortured; they confessed and were executed, (o) He then had these events entered in his Record
Book, while Mordecai himself also wrote an account of them, (p) The king then appointed Mordecai to an office
at court and rewarded him with presents, (q) But Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, who enjoyed high
favour with the king, determined to injure Mordecai in revenge for the affair of the king’s two officers.

Est 1 :2 In those days, when King Ahasuerus was sitting on his royal throne in the citadel of Susa,

Est 1 :3 in the third year of his reign, he gave a banquet at his court for all his officers-of-state and ministers,
Persian and Median army-commanders, nobles and provincial governors.

Est 1 :4 Thus he displayed the riches and splendour of his empire and the pomp and glory of his majesty; the
festivities went on for a long time, a hundred and eighty days.

Est 1 :5 When this period was over, for seven days the king gave a banquet for all the people living in the citadel
of Susa, to high and low alike, on the esplanade in the gardens of the royal palace.

Est 1 :6 There were white and violet hangings fastened with cords of fine linen and purple thread to silver rings
on marble columns, couches of gold and silver on a pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl and precious
stones.

Est 1 :7 For drinking there were golden cups of various design and plenty of wine provided by the king with royal
liberality.

Est 1 :8 The royal edict did not, however, make drinking obligatory, the king having instructed the officials of his
household to treat each guest according to the guest’s own wishes.

Est 1 :9 Queen Vashti, for her part, gave a banquet for the women in the royal palace of King Ahasuerus.

Est 1:10 On the seventh day, when the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona,
Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar and Carkas, the seven officers in attendance on the person of King Ahasuerus,

Est 1:11 to bring Queen Vashti before the king, crowned with her royal diadem, in order to display her beauty to
the people and the officers-of-state, since she was very beautiful.

Est 1:12 But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s command delivered by the officers. The king was very
angry at this and his rage grew hot.

Est 1:13 Addressing himself to the wise men who were versed in the law — it being the practice to refer matters
affecting the king to expert lawyers and jurists-

Est 1:14 he summoned Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena and Memucan, seven Persian
and Median officers-of-state who had privileged access to the royal presence and occupied the leading positions
in the kingdom.

Est 1:15 “According to law”, he said, “what is to be done to Queen Vashti for not obeying the command of King
Ahasuerus delivered by the officers?”.

Est 1:16 In the presence of the king and the officers-of-state, Memucan replied, “Queen Vashti has wronged not
only the king but also all the officers-of-state and all the peoples inhabiting the provinces of King Ahasuerus.

Est 1:17 The queen’s conduct will soon become known to all the women, who will adopt a contemptuous



attitude towards their own husbands. They will say, ‘King Ahasuerus himself commanded Queen Vashti to
appear before him and she did not come’.

Est 1:18 Before the day is out, the wives of the Persian and Median office rs-of-state will be telling every one of
the king’s office rs-of-state what they have heard about the queen’s behaviour; and that will mean contempt and
anger all round.

Est 1:19 If it is the king’s pleasure, let him issue a royal edict, to be irrevocably incorporated into the laws of the
Persians and Medes, to the effect that Vashti is never to appear again before King Ahasuerus, and let the king
confer her royal dignity on a worthier woman.

Est 1 :20 Let this edict issued by the king be proclaimed throughout his empire — which is great — and all the
women will henceforth bow to the authority of their husbands, both high and low alike”.

Est 1 :21 This speech pleased the king and the office rs-of-state, and the king did as Memucan advised.

Est 1 :22 He sent letters to all the provinces of the kingdom, to each province in its own script and to each nation
in its own language, ensuring that every husband should be master in his own house.

Est 2:1 Some time after this, when the king’s wrath had subsided, Ahasuerus remembered Vashti, how she had
behaved, and the measures taken against her.

Est 2:2 The king’s gentlemen-in-waiting said, “A search should be made on the king’s behalf for beautiful young
virgins,

Est 2:3 and the king appoint commissioners throughout the provinces of his realm to bring all these beautiful
young virgins to the citadel of Susa, to the harem under the authority of Hegai the king’s eunuch, custodian of
the women. Here he will give them whatever they need for enhancing their beauty,

Est 2:4 and the girl who pleases the king can take Vashti’s place as queen. 1 This advice pleased the king and he
acted on it.

Est 2:5 Now in the citadel of Susa there lived a Jew called Mordecai son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, of
the tribe of Benjamin,

Est 2:6 who had been deported from Jerusalem among the captives taken away with Jeconiah king of Judah by
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,

Est 2:7 and was now bringing up a certain Hadassah, otherwise called Esther, his uncle’s daughter, who had
lost both father and mother; the girl had a good figure and a beautiful face, and on the death of her parents
Mordecai had adopted her as his daughter.

Est 2:8 On the promulgation of the royal command and edict a great number of girls were brought to the citadel
of Susa where they were entrusted to Hegai. Esther, too, was taken to the king’s palace and entrusted to Hegai,
the custodian of the women.

Est 2:9 The girl pleased him and won his favour. Not only did he quickly provide her with all she needed for her
dressing room and her meals, but he gave her seven special maids from the king’s household and transferred
her and her maids to the best part of the harem.

Est 2:10 Esther had not divulged her race or parentage, since Mordecai had forbidden her to do so.

Est 2:1 1 Mordecai walked up and down in front of the courtyard of the harem all day and every day, to learn
how Esther was and how she was being treated.

Est 2:12 Each girl had to appear in turn before King Ahasuerus after a delay of twelve months fixed by the
regulations for the women; this preparatory period was occupied as follows: six months with oil of myrrh, and six
months with spices and lotions commonly used for feminine beauty treatment.

Est 2:13 When each girl went to the king, she was given whatever she wanted to take with her, since she then
moved from the harem into the royal household.

Est 2:14 She went there in the evening, and the following morning returned to another harem entrusted to the
care of Shaashgaz, the king’s officer, custodian of the concubines. She did not go to the king any more, unless
he was particularly pleased with her and had her summoned by name.

Est 2:15 But when it was the turn of Esther the daughter of Abihail, whose nephew Mordecai had adopted her
as his own daughter, to go into the king’s presence, she did not ask for anything beyond what had been
assigned her by Hegai, the king’s officer, custodian of the women. Esther won the approval of all who saw her.
Est 2:16 She was brought to King Ahasuerus in his royal apartments in the tenth month, which is called Tebeth,
in the seventh year of his reign;

Est 2:17 and the king liked Esther better than any of the other women; none of the other girls found so much
favour and approval with him. So he set the royal diadem on her head and proclaimed her queen instead of
Vashti.

Est 2:18 The king then gave a great banquet, Esther’s banquet, for all his officers-of-state and ministers,
decreed a holiday for all the provinces and distributed largesse with royal prodigality.

Est 2:19 When Esther, like the other girls, had been transferred to the second harem,

Est 2:20 she did not divulge her parentage or race, in obedience to the orders of Mordecai, whose instructions
she continued to follow as when she had been under his care.



Est 2:21 At this time Mordecai was attached to the Chancellery and two malcontents, Bigthan and Teresh,
officers in the king’s service as Guards of the Threshold, plotted to assassinate King Ahasuerus.

Est 2:22 Mordecai came to hear of this and informed Queen Esther, who in turn, on Mordecai’s authority, told
the king.

Est 2:23 The matter was investigated and proved to be true. The two conspirators were sent to the gallows, and
the incident was recorded in the Annals, in the royal presence.

Est 3:1 Shortly afterwards, King Ahasuerus singled out Haman son of Hammedatha, a native of Agag, for
promotion. He raised him in rank, granting him precedence over all his colleagues, the other officers-of-state,

Est 3:2 and all the royal officials employed at the Chancellery used to bow low and prostrate themselves
whenever Haman appeared — such was the king’s command. Mordecai refused either to bow or to prostrate
himself.

Est 3:3 “Why do you flout the royal command?”. the officials of the Chancellery asked Mordecai.

Est 3:4 Day after day they asked him this, but he took no notice of them. In the end they reported the matter to
Haman, to see whether Mordecai would persist in his attitude, since he had told them that he was a Jew.

Est 3:5 Haman could see for himself that Mordecai did not bow or prostrate himself in his presence; he became
furiously angry.

Est 3:6 And, on being told what race Mordecai belonged to, he thought it beneath him merely to get rid of
Mordecai, but made up his mind to wipe out all the members of Mordecai’s race, the Jews, living in Ahasuerus’
entire empire.

Est 3:7 In the first month, that is the month of Nisan, of the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, the pur (that is, the
lot) was cast in Haman’s presence, to determine the day and the month. The lot falling on the twelfth month,
which is Adar,

Est 3:8 Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a certain unassimilated nation scattered among the other
nations throughout the provinces of your realm; their laws are different from those of all the other nations, and
the royal laws they ignore; hence it is not in the king’s interests to tolerate them.

Est 3:9 If their destruction be signed, so please the king, I am ready to pay ten thousand talants of silver to the
king’s receivers, to be credited to the royal treasury”.

Est 3:10 The king then took his signet ring off his hand and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha, the
persecutor of the Jews.

Est 3:1 1 “Keep the money”, he said, “and you can have the people too; do what you like with them”.

Est 3:12 The royal scribes were therefore summoned for the thirteenth day of the first month, when they wrote
out the orders addressed by Haman to the king’s satraps, to the governors ruling each province and to the
principal officials of each people, to each province in its own script and to each people in its own language. The
edict was signed in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with his ring,

Est 3:13 and letters were sent by runners to every province of the realm, ordering the destruction, slaughter and
annihilation of all Jews, young and old, including women and children, on the same day — the thirteenth day of
the twelfth month, which is Adar — and the seizing of their possessions, (a) The text of the letter was as follows:
“The Great King, Ahasuerus, to the governors of the hundred and twenty-seven provinces stretching from India
to Ethiopia, and to their subordinate district commissioners: (b) “Being placed in authority over many nations and
ruling the whole world, I have resolved never to be carried away by the insolence of power, but always to rule
with moderation and clemency, so as to assure for my subjects a life ever free from storms and, offering my
kingdom the benefits of civilisation and free transit from end to end, to restore that peace which all men desire.

(c) In consultation with our advisers as to how this aim is to be effected, we have been informed by one of them,
eminent among us for prudence and well proved for his unfailing devotion and unshakeable trustworthiness, and
in rank second only to our majesty, Haman by name, (d) that there is, mingled among all the tribes of the earth, a
certain ill-disposed people, opposed by its laws to every other nation and continually defying the royal
ordinances, in such a way as to obstruct that form of government assured by us to the general good, (e)
“Considering therefore that this people, unique of its kind, is in complete opposition to all humanity from which it
differs by its outlandish laws, that it is hostile to our interests and that it commits the most heinous crimes, to the
point of endangering the stability of the realm: (f) “We command that those persons designated to you in the
letters written by Haman, who was appointed to watch over our interests and is a second father to us, be all
destroyed, root and branch, including women and children, by the swords of their enemies, without any pity or
mercy, on the fourteenth day of the twelfth month, Adar, of the present year, (g) so that, these past and present
malcontents being in one day forcibly thrown down to Hades, our government may henceforward enjoy perpetual
stability and peace”.

Est 3:14 Copies of this decree, to be promulgated as law in each province, were published to the various
peoples, so that each might be ready for the day aforementioned.

Est 3:15 At the king’s command, the runners set out with all speed; the decree was first promulgated in the
citadel of Susa. While the king and Haman gave themselves up to feasting and drinking, consternation reigned in



the city of Susa.

Est 4:1 When Mordecai learned what had happened, he tore his garments and put on sackcloth and ashes.

Then he walked into the centre of the city, wailing loudly and bitterly,

Est 4:2 until he arrived in front of the Chancellery, which no one clothed in sackcloth was allowed to enter.

Est 4:3 And in every province, no sooner had the royal command and edict arrived, than among the Jews there
was great mourning, fasting, weeping and wailing, and many lay on sackcloth and ashes.

Est 4:4 When Queen Esther’s maids and officers came and told her, she was overcome with grief. She sent
clothes for Mordecai to put on instead of his sackcloth, but he refused them.

Est 4:5 Esther then summoned Hathach, an officer whom the king had appointed to wait on her, and ordered
him to go to Mordecai and enquire what the matter was and why he was acting in this way.

Est 4:6 Hathach went out to Mordecai in the city square in front of the Chancellery,

Est 4:7 and Mordecai told him what had happened to him personally, and also about the sum of money which
Haman had offered to pay into the royal treasury to procure the destruction of the Jews.

Est 4:8 He also gave him a copy of the edict of extermination published in Susa for him to show Esther for her
information, with the message that she was to go to the king and implore his favour and plead with him for the
race to which she belonged, (a) “Remember your humbler circumstances”, he said, “when you were fed by my
hand. Since Haman, the second person in the realm, has petitioned the king for our deaths, (b) invoke the Lord,
speak to the king for us and save us from death!”.

Est 4:9 Hathach came back and told Esther what Mordecai had said;

Est 4:10 and she replied with the following message for Mordecai,

Est 4:11 “Royal officials and people living in the provinces alike all know that for anyone, man or woman, who
approaches the king in the private apartments without having been summoned there, there is only one law: he
must die, unless the king, by pointing his golden sceptre towards him, grants him his life. And I have not been
summoned to the king for the last thirty days”.

Est 4:12 These words of Esther were reported to Mordecai,

Est 4:13 who sent back the following reply, “Do not suppose that, because you are in the king’s palace, you are
going to be the one Jew to escape.

Est 4:14 No; if you persist in remaining silent at such a time, relief and deliverance will come to the Jews from
another quarter, but both you and your father’s whole family will perish. Who knows? Perhaps you have come to
the throne for just such a time as this”.

Est 4:15 Whereüpon Esther sent this reply to Mordecai,

Est 4:16 “Go and assemble all the Jews now in Susa and fast for me. Do not eat or drink day or night for three
days. For my part, I and my waiting-women shall keep the same fast, after which I shall go to the king in spite of
the law; and if I perish, I perish”.

Est 4:17 Mordecai went away and carried out Esther’s instructions, (a) Then calling to mind all the wonderful
works of the Lord, he offered this prayer: (b) Lord, Lord, Almighty King, everything is subject to your power, and
there is no one who can withstand you in your determination to save Israel, (c) You have made heaven and
earth, and all the marvels that are under heaven. You are the Master of the universe and no one can resist you,
Lord, (d) You know all things, you, Lord, know that neither pride, self-esteem nor vainglory prompted me to do
what I have done: to refuse to prostrate myself before proud Haman. Gladly would I have kissed the soles of his
feet, had this assured the safety of Israel, (e) But what I have done, I have done, rather than place the glory of a
man above the glory of God; and I shall not prostrate myself to anyone except, Lord, to you, and, in so doing, I
shall not be acting in pride, (f) And now, Lord God, King, God of Abraham spare your people! For our ruin is
being plotted, there are plans to destroy your ancient heritage, (g) Do not overlook your inheritance, which you
redeemed from Egypt to be yours, (h) Hear my supplication, have mercy on your heritage, and turn our grief into
rejoicing, so that we may live, Lord, to hymn your name. Do not suffer the mouths of those who praise you to
perish, (i) And all Israel cried out with all their might, since death was staring them in the face, (k) Queen Esther
also took refuge with the Lord in the mortal peril which had overtaken her. She took off her sumptuous robes and
put on sorrowful mourning. Instead of expensive perfumes, she covered her head with ashes and dung. She
mortified her body severely, and the former scenes of her happiness and elegance were now littered with tresses
torn from her hair. She besought the Lord God of Israel in these words: (I) My Lord, our King, the Only One,
come to my help, for I am alone and have no helper but you and am about to take my life in my hands, (m) I
have been taught from infancy in the bosom of my family that you, Lord, have chosen Israel out of all the nations
and our ancestors out of all before them, to be your heritage for ever; and that you have treated them as you
promised, (n) But we have sinned against you and you have handed us over to our enemies for paying honour to
their gods. Lord, you are upright, (o) But they are not satisfied with the bitterness of our slavery: they have
pledged themselves to their idols to abolish the decree that your own lips have uttered, to blot out your heritage,
to stop the mouths of those who praise you, to quench your altar and the glory of your House, (p) and instead to
open the mouths of the heathen, to sing the praise of worthless idols and for ever to idolise a king of flesh, (q) Do



not yield your sceptre, Lord, to what does not exist. Never let our ruin be matter for laughter. Turn these plots
against their authors, and make an example of the man who leads the attack on us. (r) Remember, Lord; reveal
yourself in the time of our distress. As for me, give me courage, King of gods and Master of all powers! (s) Put
persuasive words into my mouth when I face the lion; change his feeling into hatred for our enemy, so that he
may meet his end, and all those like him! (t) As for ourselves, save us by your hand, and come to my help, for I
am alone and have no one but you, Lord, (u) You have knowledge of all things, and you know that I hate
honours from the godless, that I loathe the bed of the uncircumcised, of any foreigner whatever, (w) You know I
am under constraint, that I loathe the symbol of my high position bound round my brow when I appear at court; I
loathe it as if it were a filthy rag and do not wear it on my days of leisure, (x) Your servant has not eaten at
Haman’s table, nor taken pleasure in the royal banquets, nor drunk the wine of libations, (y) Nor has your
servant found pleasure from the day of her promotion until now except in you, Lord, God of Abraham, (z) O God,
whose strength prevails over all, listen to the voice of the desperate, save us from the hand of the wicked, and
free me from my fear!

Est 5:1 (a) On the third day, when she had finished praying, she took off her suppliant’s mourning attire and
dressed herself in her full splendour. Radiant as she then appeared, she invoked God who watches over all
people and saves them. With her, she took two ladies-in-waiting. With a delicate air she leaned on one, while the
other accompanied her carrying her train, (b) Rosy with the full flush of her beauty, her face radiated joy and
love: but her heart shrank with fear, (c) Having passed through door after door, she found herself in the presence
of the king. He was sitting on his royal throne, dressed in all his robes of state, glittering with gold and precious
stones — a formidable sight, (d) He looked up, afire with majesty and, blazing with anger, saw her. The queen
sank to the floor. As she fainted, the colour drained from her face and her head fell against the lady-in-waiting
beside her. (e) But God changed the king’s heart, inducing a milder spirit. He sprang from his throne in alarm
and took her in his arms until she recovered, comforting her with soothing words, (f) “What is the matter, Esther?”.
he said. “I am your brother. Take heart, you are not going to die; our order applies only to ordinary people. Come
to me”. (g) And raising his golden sceptre he laid it on Esther’s neck, embraced her and said, “Speak to me”.

Est 5:2 (a) “Sire”, she said, “to me you looked like one of God’s angels, and my heart was moved with fear of
your majesty. For you are a figure of wonder, my lord, and your face is full of graciousness”. (b) But as she spoke
she fell down in a faint. The king grew more agitated, and his courtiers all set about reviving her.

Est 5:3 “What is the matter, Queen Esther?”. the king said. “Tell me what you want; even if it is half my kingdom, I
grant it you”.

Est 5:4 “Would it please the king”, Esther replied, “to come with Haman today to the banquet I have prepared for
him?”.

Est 5:5 The king said, “Tell Haman to come at once, so that Esther may have her wish”.

Est 5:6 So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared and, during the banquet, the king
again said to Esther, “Tell me your request; I grant it to you. Tell me what you want; even if it is half my kingdom,
it is yours for the asking”.

Est 5:7 “What do I want, what is my request?”. Esther replied.

Est 5:8 “If I have found favour in the king’s eyes, and if it is his pleasure to grant what I ask and to agree to my
request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet I intend to give them tomorrow, and then I shall do as the
king says”.

Est 5:9 Haman left full of joy and high spirits that day; but when he saw Mordecai at the Chancellery, neither
standing up nor stirring at his approach, he felt a gust of anger.

Est 5:10 He restrained himself, however. Returning home, he sent for his friends and Zeresh his wife

Est 5:1 1 and held forth to them about his dazzling wealth, his many children, how the king had raised him to a

position of honour and promoted him over the heads of the king’s officers-of-state and ministers.

Est 5:12 “What is more”, he added, “Queen Esther has just invited me and the king — no one else except me — to
a banquet she was giving, and better still she has invited me and the king again tomorrow.

Est 5:13 But what do I care about all this when all the while I see Mordecai the Jew sitting there at the
Chancellery?”.

Est 5:14 “Have a fifty-cubit gallows run up”, said Zeresh his wife and all his friends, “and in the morning ask the
king to have Mordecai hanged on it. Then you can go with the king to the banquet, without a care in the world!”.
Delighted with this advice, Haman had the gallows erected.

Est 6:1 That night the king could not sleep; he called for the Record Book, or Annals, to be brought and read to
him.

Est 6:2 They contained an account of how Mordecai had denounced Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king’s
eunuchs serving as Guards of the Threshold, who had plotted to assassinate King Ahasuerus.

Est 6:3 “And what honour and dignity”, the king asked, “was conferred on Mordecai for this?”. “Nothing has been
done for him”, the gentlemen-in-waiting replied.

Est 6:4 The king then said, “Who is outside in the antechamber?”. Haman had, that very moment, entered the



outer antechamber of the private apartments, to ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on the gallows which he
had just put up for the purpose.

Est 6:5 So the king’s gentlemen-in-waiting replied, “It is Haman out in the antechamber”. “Bring him in”, the king
said,

Est 6:6 and, as soon as Haman came in, went on to ask, “What is the right way to treat a man whom the king
wishes to honour?”. “Whom”, thought Haman, “would the king wish to honour, if not me?”.

Est 6:7 So he replied, “If the king wishes to honour someöne,

Est 6:8 royal robes should be brought from the king’s wardrobe, and a horse from the king’s stable, sporting a
royal diadem on its head.

Est 6:9 The robes and horse should be entrusted to one of the noblest of the king’s officers-of-state, who should
then array the man whom the king wishes to honour and lead him on horseback through the city square,
proclaiming before him: ‘This is the way a man shall be treated whom the king wishes to honour’”.

Est 6:10 “Hurry”, the king said to Haman, “take the robes and the horse, and do everything you have just said to
Mordecai the Jew, who works at the Chancellery. On no account leave out anything that you have mentioned”.
Est 6:1 1 So taking the robes and the horse, Haman arrayed Mordecai and led him on horseback through the
city square, proclaiming before him: “This is the way a man shall be treated whom the king wishes to honour”.

Est 6:12 After this Mordecai returned to the Chancellery, while Haman went hurrying home in dejection and
covering his face.

Est 6:13 He told his wife Zeresh and all his friends what had just happened. His wife Zeresh and his friends
said, “You are beginning to fall, and Mordecai to rise; if he is Jewish, you will never get the better of him. With
him against you, your fall is certain”.

Est 6:14 While they were still talking, the king’s officers arrived in a hurry to escort Haman to the banquet that
Esther was giving.

Est 7:1 The king and Haman went to Queen Esther’s banquet,

Est 7:2 and this second day, during the banquet, the king again said to Esther, “Tell me your request, Queen
Esther. I grant it to you. Whatever you want; even if it is half my kingdom, it is yours for the asking”.

Est 7:3 “If I have found favour in your eyes, O king”, Queen Esther replied, “and if it please your majesty, grant
me my life — that is my request; and the lives of my people — that is what I want.

Est 7:4 For we have been handed over, my people and I, to destruction, slaughter and annihilation; had we
merely been sold as slaves and servant-girls, I should not have said anything; but in the present case, it will be
beyond the persecutor’s means to make good the loss that the king is about to sustain”.

Est 7:5 King Ahasuerus interrupted Queen Esther, “Who is this man?”. he exclaimed. “Where is the man who has
thought of doing such a thing?”.

Est 7:6 Esther replied, “The persecutor, the enemy? Why, this wretch Haman!”. Haman quaked with terror in the
presence of the king and queen.

Est 7:7 In a rage the king got up from the banquet and went into the palace garden; while Haman, realising that
the king was determined on his ruin, stayed behind to beg Queen Esther for his life.

Est 7:8 When the king came back from the palace garden into the banqueting hall, he found Haman sprawled
across the couch where Esther was reclining. “What!”. the king exclaimed. “Is he going to rape the queen in my
own palace?”. The words were scarcely out of his mouth than a veil was thrown over Haman’s face.

Est 7:9 In the royal presence, Harbona, one of the officers, said, “There is that fifty-cubit gallows, too, which
Haman ran up for Mordecai, who spoke up to the king’s great advantage. It is all ready at his house”. “Hang him
on it”, said the king.

Est 7:10 So Haman was hanged on the gallows which he had erected for Mordecai, and the king’s wrath
subsided.

Est 8:1 That same day King Ahasuerus gave Queen Esther the house of Haman, the persecutor of the Jews.
Mordecai was presented to the king, Esther having revealed their mutual relationship.

Est 8:2 The king, who had recovered his signet ring from Haman, took it off and gave it to Mordecai, while
Esther gave Mordecai charge of Haman’s house.

Est 8:3 Esther again went to speak to the king. She fell at his feet, weeping and imploring his favour, to frustrate
the malice that Haman the Agagite had been plotting against the Jews.

Est 8:4 The king held out the golden sceptre to her, whereüpon Esther stood up and faced him.

Est 8:5 “If such is the king’s good pleasure”, she said, “and if I have found favour before him, if my petition seems
proper to him and if I myself am pleasing to his eyes, may he be pleased to issue a written revocation of the
letters which Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, has had written, ordering the destruction of the Jews
throughout the royal provinces.

Est 8:6 For how can I look on, while my people suffer what is proposed for them? How can I bear to witness the
extermination of my relatives?”.

Est 8:7 King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, “I for my part have given Esther



Haman’s house, and have had him hanged on the gallows for planning to destroy the Jews.

Est 8:8 You, for your part, write what you please as regards the Jews, in the king’s name, and seal it with the
king’s signet; for any edict written in the king’s name and sealed with his signet is irrevocable”.

Est 8:9 The royal scribes were summoned at once — it was the third month, the month of Sivan, on the twenty-
third day — and at Mordecai’s dictation an order was written to the Jews, the satraps, governors and principal
officials of the provinces stretching from India to Ethiopia, a hundred and twenty-seven provinces, to each
province in its own script, and to each people in its own language, and to the Jews in their own script and
language.

Est 8:10 These letters, written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with the king’s signet, were carried by
couriers mounted on horses from the king’s own stud-farms.

Est 8:1 1 In them the king granted the Jews, in whatever city they lived, the right to assemble in self-defence,
with permission to destroy, slaughter and annihilate any armed force of any people or province that might attack
them, together with their women and children, and to plunder their possessions,

Est 8:12 with effect from the same day throughout the provinces of King Ahasuerus — the thirteenth day of the
twelfth month, which is Adar. (a) The text of the letter was as follows: (b) “The Great King, Ahasuerus, to the
satraps of the hundred and twenty-seven provinces which stretch from India to Ethiopia, to the provincial
governors and to all our loyal subjects, greeting: (c) “Many people, repeatedly honoured by the extreme bounty
of their benefactors, only grow the more arrogant. It is not enough for them to seek our subjects’ injury, but
unable as they are to support the weight of their own surfeit they turn to scheming against their benefactors
themselves, (d) Not content with banishing gratitude from the human heart, but elated by the plaudits of people
unacquainted with goodness, notwithstanding that all is for ever under the eye of God, they expect to escape his
justice, so hostile to the wicked, (e) Thus it has often happened to those placed in authority that, having
entrusted friends with the conduct of affairs and allowed themselves to be influenced by them, they find
themselves sharing with these the guilt of innocent blood and involved in irremediable misfortunes, (f) the upright
intentions of rulers having been misled by false arguments of the evilly disposed, (g) This may be seen without
recourse to the history of earlier times to which we have referred; you have only to look at what is before you, at
the crimes perpetrated by a plague of unworthy officials, (h) For the future, we shall exert our efforts to assure
the tranquillity and peace of the realm for all, (i) by adopting new policies and by always judging matters that are
brought to our notice in the most equitable spirit, (k) “Thus Haman son of Hammedatha, a Macedonian, without a
drop of Persian blood and far removed from our goodness, enjoyed our hospitality (I) and was treated by us with
the benevolence which we show to every nation, even to the extent of being proclaimed our “father” and being
accorded universally the prostration of respect as second in dignity to the royal throne, (m) But he, unable to
keep within his own high rank, schemed to deprive us of our realm and of our life, (n) Furthermore, by tortuous
wiles and arguments, he would have had us destroy Mordecai, our saviour and constant benefactor, with Esther
the blameless partner of our majesty, and their whole nation besides, (o) He thought by these means to leave us
without support and so to transfer the Persian empire to the Macedonians, (p) “But we find that the Jews, marked
out for annihilation by this arch-scoundrel, are not criminals: they are in fact governed by the most just of laws.

(q) They are children of the Most High, the great and living God to whom we and our ancestors owe the
continuing prosperity of our realm, (r) You will therefore do well not to act on the letters sent by Haman son of
Hammedatha, since their author has been hanged at the gates of Susa with his whole household: a fitting
punishment, which God, Master of the Universe, has speedily inflicted on him. (s) Put up copies of this letter
everywhere, allow the Jews to observe their own customs without fear, and come to their help against anyone
who attacks them on the day originally chosen for their maltreatment, that is, the thirteenth day of the twelfth
month, which is Adar. (t) For the all-powerful God has made this day a day of joy and not of ruin for the chosen
people, (u) You, for your part, among your solemn festivals celebrate this as a special day with every kind of
feasting, so that now and in the future, for you and for Persians of good will, it may commemorate your rescue,
and for your enemies may stand as a reminder of their ruin, (v) “Every city and, more generally, every country,
which does not follow these instructions, will be mercilessly devastated with fire and sword, and made not only
inaccessible to human beings but hateful to wild animals and even birds for ever”.

Est 8:13 Copies of this edict, to be promulgated as law in each province, were published to the various peoples,
so that the Jews could be ready on the day stated to avenge themselves on their enemies.

Est 8:14 The couriers, mounted on the king’s horses, set out in great haste and urgency at the king’s command.
The edict was also published in the citadel of Susa.

Est 8:15 Mordecai left the royal presence in a princely gown of violet and white, with a great golden crown and a
cloak of fine linen and purple. The city of Susa shouted for joy.

Est 8:16 For the Jews there was light and gladness, joy and honour.

Est 8:17 In every province and in every city, wherever the king’s command and decree arrived, there was joy
and gladness among the Jews, with feasting and holiday-making. Of the country’s population many became
Jews, since now the Jews were feared.



Est 9:1 The king’s command and decree came into force on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, Adar, and
the day on which the enemies of the Jews had hoped to crush them produced the very opposite effect: the Jews
it was who crushed their enemies.

Est 9:2 In their towns throughout the provinces of King Ahasuerus, the Jews assembled to strike at those who
had planned to injure them. No one resisted them, since the various peoples were now all afraid of them.

Est 9:3 Provincial officers-of-state, satraps, governors and royal officials, all supported the Jews for fear of
Mordecai.

Est 9:4 And indeed Mordecai was a power in the palace and his fame was spreading through all the provinces;
Mordecai was steadily growing more powerful.

Est 9:5 So the Jews struck down all their enemies with the sword, with resulting slaughter and destruction, and
worked their will on their opponents.

Est 9:6 In the citadel of Susa alone, the Jews put to death and slaughtered five hundred men,

Est 9:7 notably Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,

Est 9:8 Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,

Est 9:9 Parmashtha, Arisai, Aridai and Jezatha,

Est 9:10 the ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the persecutor of the Jews. But they took no plunder.

Est 9:11 The number of those killed in the citadel of Susa was reported to the king that same day.

Est 9:12 The king said to Queen Esther, “In the citadel of Susa the Jews have killed five hundred men and also
the ten sons of Haman. What must they have done in the other provinces of the realm? Tell me your request; I
grant it to you. Tell me what else you would like; it is yours for the asking”.

Est 9:13 “If such is the king’s pleasure”, Esther replied, “let the Jews of Susa be allowed to enforce today’s
decree tomorrow as well. And as for the ten sons of Haman, let their bodies be hanged on the gallows”.

Est 9:14 Whereüpon, the king having given the order, the edict was promulgated in Susa and the ten sons of
Haman were hanged.

Est 9:15 Thus the Jews of Susa reassembled on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and killed three
hundred men in the city. But they took no plunder.

Est 9:16 The other Jews who lived in the king’s provinces also assembled to defend their lives and rid
themselves of their enemies. They slaughtered seventy-five thousand of their opponents. But they took no
plunder.

Est 9:17 This was on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. On the fourteenth day they rested and made it a
day of feasting and gladness.

Est 9:18 But for the Jews of Susa, who had assembled on the thirteenth and fourteenth days, the fifteenth was
the day they rested, making that a day of feasting and gladness.

Est 9:19 This is why Jewish country people, those who live in undefended villages, keep the fourteenth day of
the month of Adar as a day of gladness, feasting and holiday-making, and the exchanging of presents with one
another, (a) whereäs for those who live in cities the day of rejoicing and exchanging presents with their
neighbours is the fifteenth day of Adar.

Est 9:20 Mordecai committed these events to writing. Then he sent letters to all the Jews living in the provinces
of King Ahasuerus, both near and far,

Est 9:21 enjoining them to celebrate the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar every year,

Est 9:22 as the days on which the Jews had rid themselves of their enemies, and the month in which their
sorrow had been turned into gladness, and mourning into a holiday. He therefore told them to keep these as
days of festivity and gladness when they were to exchange presents and make gifts to the poor.

Est 9:23 Once having begun, the Jews continued observing these practices, Mordecai having written them an
account

Est 9:24 of how Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the persecutor of all the Jews, had plotted their
destruction and had cast the pur, that is, the lot, for their overthrow and ruin;

Est 9:25 but how, when he went back to the king to ask him to order the hanging of Mordecai, the wicked
scheme which he had devised against the Jews recoiled on his own head, and both he and his sons were
hanged on the gallows;

Est 9:26 and that, hence, these days were called Purim, from the word pur. And so, because of what was
written in this letter, and because of what they had seen for themselves and of what had happened to them,

Est 9:27 the Jews willingly bound themselves, their descendants and all who should join them, to celebrate
these two days without fail, in the manner prescribed and at the time appointed, year after year.

Est 9:28 Thus commemorated and celebrated from generation to generation, in every family, in every province,
in every city, these days of Purim will never be abrogated among the Jews, nor will their memory perish from
their race.

Est 9:29 Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, wrote with full authority to ratify this second letter,

Est 9:30 and sent letters to all the Jews of the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the realm of Ahasuerus,



in terms of peace and loyalty

Est 9:31 enjoining them to observe these days of Purim at the appointed time, as Mordecai the Jew had
recommended, and in the manner prescribed for themselves and their descendants, with additional ordinances
for fasts and lamentations.

Est 9:32 The ordinance of Esther fixed the law of Purim, which was then recorded in a book.

Est 1 0:1 King Ahasuerus put not only the mainland under tribute but the Mediterranean islands as well.

Est 1 0:2 All his feats of power and valour, and the account of the high honour to which he raised Mordecai: all
this is recorded in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Media and Persia.

Est 10:3 And Mordecai the Jew was next in rank to King Ahasuerus. He was a man held in respect among the
Jews, esteemed by thousands of his brothers, a man who sought the good of his people and cared for the
welfare of his entire race, (a) And Mordecai said, All this is God’s doing, (b) I remember the dream I had about
these matters, nothing of which has failed to come true: (c) the little spring that became a river, the light that
shone, the sun, the flood of water. Esther is the river — she whom the king married and made queen, (d) The two
dragons are Haman and myself, (e) The nations are those that banded together to blot out the name of Jew. (f)
The single nation, mine, is Israel, those who cried out to God and were saved. Yes, the Lord has saved his
people, the Lord has delivered us from all these evils, God has worked such signs and great wonders as have
never occurred among the nations, (g) Two destinies he appointed, one for his own people, one for the nations
at large, (h) And these two destinies were worked out at the hour and time and day laid down by God, involving
all the nations, (i) In this way God has remembered his people and vindicated his heritage; (k) and for them
these days, the fourteenth and fifteenth of the month of Adar, are to be days of assembly, of joy and of gladness
before God, through all generations and for ever among his people Israel”. (I) In the fourth year of the reign of
Ptolemy and Cleopatra, Dositheus, who affirmed that he was a priest and Levite, and Ptolemy his son brought
the foregoing letter concerning Purim. They vouched for its authenticity, the translation having been made by
Lysimachus son of Ptolemy, a member of the Jerusalem community.

1 Ma 1:1 Alexander of Macedon son of Philip had come from the land of Kittim and defeated Darius king of the
Persians and Medes, whom he succeeded as ruler, at first of Hellas.

1 Ma 1:2 He undertook many campaigns, gained possession of many fortresses, and put the local kings to
death.

IMa 1:3 So he advanced to the ends of the earth, plundering nation after nation; the earth grew silent before
him, and his ambitious heart swelled with pride.

IMa 1:4 He assembled very powerful forces and subdued provinces, nations and princes, and they became his
tributaries.

IMa 1:5 But the time came when Alexander took to his bed, in the knowledge that he was dying.

IMa 1:6 He summoned his officers, noblemen who had been brought up with him from his youth, and divided
his kingdom among them while he was still alive.

IMa 1:7 Alexander had reigned twelve years when he died.

IMa 1:8 Each of his officers established himself in his own region.

IMa 1:9 All assumed crowns after his death, they and their heirs after them for many years, bringing increasing
evils on the world.

IMa 1:10 From these there grew a wicked offshoot, Antiochus Epiphanes son of King Antiochus; once a
hostage in Rome, he became king in the 107th year of the kingdom of the Greeks.

1 Ma 1 :1 1 It was then that there emerged from Israel a set of renegades who led many people astray. “Come”,
they said, “let us ally ourselves with the gentiles surrounding us, for since we separated ourselves from them
many misfortunes have overtaken us”.

IMa 1:12 This proposal proved acceptable,

IMa 1:13 and a number of the people eagerly approached the king, who authorised them to practise the
gentiles’ observances.

1 Ma 1 :14 So they built a gymnasium in Jerusalem, such as the gentiles have,

IMa 1:15 disguised their circumcision, and abandoned the holy covenant, submitting to gentile rule as willing
slaves of impiety.

IMa 1:16 Once Antiochus had seen his authority established, he determined to make himself king of Egypt and
the ruler of both kingdoms.

IMa 1:17 He invaded Egypt in massive strength, with chariots and elephants (and cavalry) and a large fleet.

IMa 1:18 He engaged Ptolemy king of Egypt in battle, and Ptolemy turned back and fled before his advance,
leaving many casualties.

IMa 1:19 The fortified cities of Egypt were captured, and Antiochus plundered the country.

IMa 1:20 After his conquest of Egypt, in the year 143, Antiochus turned about and advanced on Israel and
Jerusalem in massive strength.

1 Ma 1 :21 Insolently breaking into the sanctuary, he removed the golden altar and the lamp-stand for the light



with all its fittings,

1 Ma 1 :22 together with the table for the loaves of permanent offering, the libation vessels, the cups, the golden
censers, the veil, the crowns, and the golden decoration on the front of the Temple, which he stripped of
everything.

1 Ma 1 :23 He made off with the silver and gold and precious vessels; he discovered the secret treasures and
seized them

IMa 1:24 and, removing all these, he went back to his own country, having shed much blood and uttered words
of extreme arrogance.

1 Ma 1 :25 There was deep mourning for Israel throughout the country:

IMa 1:26 Rulers and elders groaned; girls and young men wasted away; the women’s beauty suffered a
change;

IMa 1:27 every bridegroom took up a dirge, the bride sat grief-stricken on her marriage-bed.

1 Ma 1 :28 The earth quaked because of its inhabitants and the whole House of Jacob was clothed with shame.

1 Ma 1 :29 Two years later the king sent the Mysarch through the cities of Judah. He came to Jerusalem with an
impressive force,

IMa 1:30 and addressing them with what appeared to be peaceful words, he gained their confidence; then
suddenly he fell on the city, dealing it a terrible blow, and destroying many of the people of Israel.

1 Ma 1 :31 He pillaged the city and set it on fire, tore down its houses and encircling wall,

IMa 1:32 took the women and children captive and commandeered the cattle.

1 Ma 1 :33 They then rebuilt the City of David with a great strong wall and strong towers and made this their
Citadel.

1 Ma 1 :34 There they installed a brood of sinners, of renegades, who fortified themselves inside it,

IMa 1:35 storing arms and provisions, and depositing there the loot they had collected from Jerusalem; they
were to prove a great trouble.

1 Ma 1 :36 It became an ambush for the sanctuary, an evil adversary for Israel at all times.

IMa 1:37 They shed innocent blood all round the sanctuary and defiled the sanctuary itself.

IMa 1:38 The citizens of Jerusalem fled because of them, she became a dwelling-place of strangers; estranged
from her own offspring, her children forsook her.

1 Ma 1 :39 Her sanctuary became as forsaken as a desert, her feasts were turned into mourning, her Sabbaths
into a mockery, her honour into reproach.

1 Ma 1 :40 Her dishonour now fully matched her former glory, her greatness was turned into grief.

1 Ma 1 :41 The king then issued a proclamation to his whole kingdom that all were to become a single people,
each nation renouncing its particular customs.

IMa 1:42 All the gentiles conformed to the king’s decree,

IMa 1:43 and many Israelites chose to accept his religion, sacrificing to idols and profaning the Sabbath.

1 Ma 1 :44 The king also sent edicts by messenger to Jerusalem and the towns of Judah, directing them to adopt
customs foreign to the country,

IMa 1:45 banning burnt offerings, sacrifices and libations from the sanctuary, profaning Sabbaths and feasts,
IMa 1:46 defiling the sanctuary and everything holy,

IMa 1:47 building altars, shrines and temples for idols, sacrificing pigs and unclean beasts,

1 Ma 1 :48 leaving their sons uncircumcised, and prostituting themselves to all kinds of impurity and abomination,
1 Ma 1 :49 so that they should forget the Law and revoke all observance of it.

1 Ma 1 :50 Anyone not obeying the king’s command was to be put to death.

1 Ma 1 :51 Writing in such terms to every part of his kingdom, the king appointed inspectors for the whole people
and directed all the towns of Judah to offer sacrifice city by city.

1 Ma 1 :52 Many of the people — that is, every apostate from the Law — rallied to them and so committed evil in
the country,

IMa 1:53 forcing Israel into hiding in any possible place of refuge.

1 Ma 1 :54 On the fifteenth day of Chislev in the year 145 the king built the appalling abomination on top of the
altar of burnt offering; and altars were built in the surrounding towns of Judah
1 Ma 1 :55 and incense offered at the doors of houses and in the streets.

1 Ma 1 :56 Any books of the Law that came to light were torn up and burned.

1 Ma 1 :57 Whenever anyone was discovered possessing a copy of the covenant or practising the Law, the
king’s decree sentenced him to death.

1 Ma 1 :58 Month after month they took harsh action against any offenders they discovered in the towns of Israel.

1 Ma 1 :59 On the twenty-fifth day of each month, sacrifice was offered on the altar erected on top of the altar of

burnt offering.

IMa 1:60 Women who had had their children circumcised were put to death according to the edict
1 Ma 1 :61 with their babies hung round their necks, and the members of their household and those who had



performed the circumcision were executed with them.

IMa 1:62 Yet there were many in Israel who stood firm and found the courage to refuse unclean food.

1 Ma 1 :63 They chose death rather than contamination by such fare or profanation of the holy covenant, and
they were executed.

1 Ma 1 :64 It was a truly dreadful retribution that visited Israel.

1 Ma 2:1 About then, Mattathias son of John, son of Simeon, a priest of the line of Joarib, left Jerusalem and
settled in Modein.

IMa 2:2 He had five sons, John known as Gaddi,

IMa 2:3 Simon called Thassi,

IMa 2:4 Judas called Maccabaeus,

IMa 2:5 Eleazar, called Avaran, and Jonathan called Apphus.

IMa 2:6 When he saw the blasphemies being committed in Judah and Jerusalem,

1 Ma 2:7 he said, “Alas that I should have been born to witness the ruin of my people and the ruin of the Holy
City, and to sit by while she is delivered over to her enemies, and the sanctuary into the hand of foreigners.

1 Ma 2:8 “Her Temple has become like someöne of no repute,

1 Ma 2:9 the vessels that were her glory have been carried off as booty, her babies have been slaughtered in
her streets, her young men by the enemy’s sword.

IMa 2:10 Is there a nation that has not claimed a share of her royal prerogatives, that has not taken some of her
spoils?

1 Ma 2:1 1 All her ornaments have been snatched from her, her former freedom has become slavery.

IMa 2:12 See how the Holy Place, our beauty, our glory, is now laid waste, see how the gentiles have profaned
it!

IMa 2:13 What have we left to live for?”.

1 Ma 2:14 Mattathias and his sons tore their garments, put on sackcloth, and observed deep mourning.

IMa 2:15 The king’s commissioners who were enforcing the apostasy came to the town of Modein for the
sacrifices.

IMa 2:16 Many Israelites gathered round them, but Mattathias and his sons drew apart.

IMa 2:17 The king’s commissioners then addressed Mattathias as follows, “You are a respected leader, a great
man in this town; you have sons and brothers to support you.

IMa 2:18 Be the first to step forward and conform to the king’s decree, as all the nations have done, and the
leaders of Judah and the survivors in Jerusalem; you and your sons shall be reckoned among the Friends of the
King, you and your sons will be honoured with gold and silver and many presents”.

IMa 2:19 Raising his voice, Mattathias retorted, “Even if every nation living in the king’s dominions obeys him,
each forsaking its ancestral religion to conform to his decrees,

1 Ma 2:20 I, my sons and my brothers will still follow the covenant of our ancestors.

1 Ma 2:21 May Heaven preserve us from forsaking the Law and its observances.

1 Ma 2:22 As for the king’s orders, we will not follow them: we shall not swerve from our own religion either to
right or to left”.

1 Ma 2:23 As he finished speaking, a Jew came forward in the sight of all to offer sacrifice on the altar in Modein
as the royal edict required.

1 Ma 2:24 When Mattathias saw this, he was fired with zeal; stirred to the depth of his being, he gave vent to his
legitimate anger, threw himself on the man and slaughtered him on the altar.

1 Ma 2:25 At the same time he killed the king’s commissioner who was there to enforce the sacrifice, and tore
down the altar.

1 Ma 2:26 In his zeal for the Law he acted as Phinehas had against Zimri son of Salu.

1 Ma 2:27 Then Mattathias went through the town, shouting at the top of his voice, “Let everyone who has any
zeal for the Law and takes his stand on the covenant come out and follow me”.

IMa 2:28 Then he fled with his sons into the hills, leaving all their possessions behind in the town.

1 Ma 2:29 Many people who were concerned for virtue and justice went down to the desert and stayed there,

1 Ma 2:30 taking with them their sons, their wives and their cattle, so oppressive had their sufferings become.

1 Ma 2:31 Word was brought to the royal officials and forces stationed in Jerusalem, in the City of David, that
those who had repudiated the king’s edict had gone down to the hiding places in the desert.

1 Ma 2:32 A strong detachment went after them, and when it came up with them ranged itself against them in
battle formation, preparing to attack them on the Sabbath day,

1 Ma 2:33 and said, “Enough of this! Come out and do as the king orders and you will be spared”.

IMa 2:34 The others, however, replied, “We refuse to come out, and we will not obey the king’s orders and
profane the Sabbath day”.

1 Ma 2:35 The royal forces at once went into action,

1 Ma 2:36 but the others offered no opposition; not a stone was thrown, there was no barricading of the hiding



places.

1 Ma 2:37 They only said, “Let us all die innocent; let heaven and earth bear witness that you are massacring us
with no pretence of justice”.

1 Ma 2:38 The attack was pressed home on the Sabbath itself, and they were slaughtered, with their wives and
children and cattle, to the number of one thousand persons.

IMa 2:39 When the news reached Mattathias and his friends, they mourned them bitterly
1 Ma 2:40 and said to one another, “If we all do as our brothers have done, and refuse to fight the gentiles for our
lives and institutions, they will only destroy us the sooner from the earth”.

1 Ma 2:41 So then and there they came to this decision, “If anyone attacks us on the Sabbath day, whoëver he
may be, we shall resist him; we must not all be killed, as our brothers were in the hiding places”.

1 Ma 2:42 Soon they were joined by the Hasidaean party, stout fighting men of Israel, each one a volunteer on
the side of the Law.

IMa 2:43 All the refugees from the persecution rallied to them, giving them added support.

IMa 2:44 They organised themselves into an armed force, striking down the sinners in their anger, and the
renegades in their fury, and those who escaped them fled to the gentiles for safety.

IMa 2:45 Mattathias and his friends made a tour, overthrowing the altars

IMa 2:46 and forcibly circumcising all the boys they found uncircumcised in the territories of Israel.

IMa 2:47 They hunted down the upstarts and managed their campaign to good effect.

1 Ma 2:48 They wrested the Law out of the control of the gentiles and the kings and reduced the sinners to
impotence.

1 Ma 2:49 As the days of Mattathias were drawing to a close, he said to his sons, “Arrogance and outrage are
now in the ascendant; it is a period of turmoil and bitter hatred.

1 Ma 2:50 This is the time, my children, for you to have a burning zeal for the Law and to give your lives for the
covenant of our ancestors.

IMa 2:51 Remember the deeds performed by our ancestors, each in his generation, and you will win great
honour and everlasting renown.

1 Ma 2:52 Was not Abraham tested and found faithful, was that not considered as justifying him?

IMa 2:53 Joseph in the time of his distress maintained the Law, and so became lord of Egypt.

1 Ma 2:54 Phinehas, our father, in return for his burning zeal, received the covenant of everlasting priesthood.

1 Ma 2:55 Joshua, for carrying out his task, became judge of Israel.

IMa 2:56 Caleb, for his testimony before the assembled people, received an inheritance in the land.

1 Ma 2:57 David for his generous heart inherited the throne of an everlasting kingdom.

1 Ma 2:58 Elijah for his consuming fervour for the Law was caught up to heaven itself.

1 Ma 2:59 Hananiah, Azariah and Mishael, for their fidelity, were saved from the flame.

1 Ma 2:60 Daniel for his singleness of heart was rescued from the lion’s jaws.

1 Ma 2:61 Know then that, generation after generation, no one who hopes in him will be overcome.

1 Ma 2:62 Do not fear the threats of the sinner, all his brave show must come to the dunghill and the worms.

1 Ma 2:63 Exalted today, tomorrow he is nowhere to be found, for he has returned to the dust he came from and

his scheming is brought to nothing.

1 Ma 2:64 My children, be resolute and courageous for the Law, for it will bring you glory.

1 Ma 2:65 “Here is your brother Simeon, I know he is a man of sound judgement. Listen to him all your lives; let
him take your father’s place.

1 Ma 2:66 Judas Maccabaeus, strong and brave from his youth, let him be your general and conduct the war
against the gentiles.

1 Ma 2:67 The rest of you are to enrol in your ranks all those who keep the Law, and to assure the vengeance of
your people.

1 Ma 2:68 Pay back the gentiles to the full, and hold fast to the ordinance of the Law”.

1 Ma 2:69 Then he blessed them and was joined to his ancestors.

IMa 2:70 He died in the year 146 and was buried in his ancestral tomb at Modein, and all Israel mourned him
deeply.

IMa 3:1 His son, Judas, known as Maccabaeus, then took his place.

1 Ma 3:2 All his brothers, and all who had attached themselves to his father, supported him, and they fought for
Israel with a will.

IMa 3:3 He extended the fame of his people. Like a giant, he put on the breastplate and buckled on his war
harness; he engaged in battle after battle, protecting the ranks with his sword.

IMa 3:4 He was like a lion in his exploits, like a young lion roaring over its prey.

IMa 3:5 He pursued and tracked down the renegades, he consigned those who troubled his people to the
flames.

IMa 3:6 The renegades quailed with the terror he inspired, all evil-doers were utterly confounded, and



deliverance went forward under his leadership.

IMa 3:7 He brought bitterness to many a king and rejoicing to Jacob by his deeds, his memory is blessed for
ever and ever.

1 Ma 3:8 He went through the towns of Judah eliminating the irreligious from them, and diverted the Retribution
from Israel.

1 Ma 3:9 His name resounded to the ends of the earth, he rallied those who were on the point of perishing.

IMa 3:10 Next, Apollonius mustered the gentiles and a large force from Samaria to make war on Israel.

1 Ma 3:1 1 When Judas learned of it, he went out to meet him and routed and killed him. Many fell wounded, and
the survivors took to flight.

IMa 3:12 Their spoils were seized and the sword of Apollonius was taken by Judas, who used it to fight with
throughout his life.

IMa 3:13 On hearing that Judas had raised a mixed force of believers and seasoned fighters,

1 Ma 3:14 Seron, commander of the Syrian troops, said, “I shall make a name for myself and gain honour in the
kingdom if I fight Judas and those supporters of his who are so contemptuous of the king’s orders”.

IMa 3:15 He therefore launched another expedition, with a strong army of unbelievers to support him in taking
revenge on the Israelites.

IMa 3:16 He had nearly reached the descent of Beth-Horon when Judas went out to confront him with a handful
of men.

IMa 3:17 But as soon as these saw the force advancing to meet them, they said to Judas, “How can we, few as
we are, engage such overwhelming numbers? We are exhausted as it is, not having had anything to eat today”.
IMa 3:18 “It is easy”, Judas answered, “for a great number to be defeated by a few; indeed, in the sight of
Heaven, deliverance, whether by many or by few, is all one;

IMa 3:19 for victory in war does not depend on the size of the fighting force: Heaven accords the strength.

IMa 3:20 They are coming against us in full-blown insolence and lawlessness to destroy us, our wives and our
children, and to plunder us;

1 Ma 3:21 but we are fighting for our lives and our laws,

1 Ma 3:22 and he will crush them before our eyes; do not be afraid of them”.

1 Ma 3:23 When he had finished speaking, he made a sudden sally against Seron and his force and
overwhelmed them.

1 Ma 3:24 Judas pursued them down from Beth-Horon as far as the plain. About eight hundred of their men fell,
and the rest took refuge in the country of the Philistines.

IMa 3:25 Judas and his brothers began to be feared, and alarm seized the surrounding peoples.

IMa 3:26 His name even reached the king’s ears, and among the nations there was talk of Judas and his
battles.

1 Ma 3:27 The news of these events infuriated Antiochus, and he ordered mobilisation of all the forces in his
kingdom, a very powerful army.

IMa 3:28 Opening his treasury, he distributed a year’s pay to his troops, telling them to be prepared for any
eventuality.

1 Ma 3:29 He then found that the money in his coffers had run short and that the tribute of the province had
decreased, as a result of the dissension and disaster brought on the country by his own abrogation of laws that
had been in force from antiquity.

1 Ma 3:30 He began to fear that, as had happened more than once, he would not have enough to cover the
expenses and the lavish bounties he had previously been accustomed to make on a larger scale than his
predecessors on the throne.

1 Ma 3:31 In this grave quandary he resolved to invade Persia, there to levy tribute on the provinces and so
accumulate substantial funds.

IMa 3:32 He therefore left Lysias, a nobleman and member of the royal family, to manage the royal affairs
between the River Euphrates and the Egyptian frontier,

1 Ma 3:33 making him responsible for the education of his son Antiochus, until he should come back.

1 Ma 3:34 To him Antiochus made over half his forces, with the elephants, giving him instructions about what he
wanted done, particularly with regard to the inhabitants of Judaea and Jerusalem,

1 Ma 3:35 against whom he was to send a force, to crush and destroy the power of Israel and the remnant of
Jerusalem, to wipe out their very memory from the place,

1 Ma 3:36 to settle foreigners in all parts of their territory and to distribute their land into lots.

1 Ma 3:37 The king took the remaining half of his troops with him and set out from Antioch, the capital of his
kingdom, in the year 147; he crossed the River Euphrates and made his way through the Upper Provinces.

IMa 3:38 Lysias chose Ptolemy son of Dorymenes, with Nicanor and Gorgias, influential men from among the
Friends of the King,

IMa 3:39 and, under their command, despatched forty thousand foot and seven thousand horse to invade the



land of Judah and devastate it, as the king had ordered.

IMa 3:40 The entire force set out and reached the neighbourhood of Emmaus in the lowlands, where they
pitched camp.

1 Ma 3:41 The local merchants, hearing the news of this, arrived at the camp, bringing with them a large amount
of gold and silver, and fetters as well, proposing to buy the Israelites as slaves; they were accompanied by a
company from Idumaea and the Philistine country.

1 Ma 3:42 Judas and his brothers saw that the situation was going from bad to worse and that armies were
camping in their territory; they were also well aware that the king had ordered the people’s total destruction.

1 Ma 3:43 So they said to each other, “Let us restore the ruins of our people and fight for our people and our
sanctuary”.

1 Ma 3:44 The Assembly was summoned, to prepare for war, to offer prayer and to implore compassion and
mercy.

1 Ma 3:45 Jerusalem was as empty as a desert, none of her children to go in and out. The sanctuary was
trodden underfoot, men of an alien race held the Citadel, which had become a lodging for gentiles. There was no
more rejoicing for Jacob, the flute and lyre were mute.

1 Ma 3:46 After mustering, they made their way to Mizpah, opposite Jerusalem, since Mizpah was traditionally a
place of prayer for Israel.

1 Ma 3:47 That day they fasted and put on sackcloth, covering their heads with ashes and tearing their
garments.

1 Ma 3:48 For the guidance that the gentiles would have sought from the images of their false gods, they opened
the Book of the Law.

1 Ma 3:49 They also brought out the priestly vestments, with first-fruits and tithes, and marshalled the Nazirites
who had completed the period of their vow.

IMa 3:50 Then, raising their voices to Heaven, they cried, “What shall we do with these people, and where are
we to take them?

IMa 3:51 Your holy place has been trampled underfoot and defiled, your priests mourn in their humiliation,

1 Ma 3:52 and now the gentiles are in alliance to destroy us: you know what they have in mind for us.

1 Ma 3:53 How can we stand up and face them if you do not come to our aid?”.

IMa 3:54 Then they sounded the trumpets and raised a great shout.

1 Ma 3:55 Next, Judas appointed leaders for the people, to command a thousand, a hundred, fifty or ten men.

1 Ma 3:56 Those who were in the middle of building a house, or were about to be married, or were planting a
vineyard, or were afraid, he told to go home again, as the Law allowed.

1 Ma 3:57 The column then marched off and took up a position south of Emmaus.

IMa 3:58 “Stand to your arms”, Judas told them, “acquit yourselves bravely, in the morning be ready to fight
these gentiles massed against us to destroy us and our sanctuary.

1 Ma 3:59 Better for us to die in battle than to watch the ruin of our nation and our Holy Place.

IMa 3:60 Whatever be the will of Heaven, he will perform it”.

1 Ma 4:1 Gorgias took with him five thousand foot and a thousand picked cavalry, and the force moved off by
night

1 Ma 4:2 with the object of attacking the Jewish position and dealing them an unexpected blow; the men from
the Citadel were there to guide him.

1 Ma 4:3 Judas got wind of it and himself moved off with his fighters to strike at the royal army at Emmaus,

IMa 4:4 while its fighting troops were still dispersed outside the camp.

1 Ma 4:5 Hence, when Gorgias reached Judas’ camp, he found no one and began looking for the Jews in the
mountains. “For”, he said, “we have got them on the run”.

1 Ma 4:6 First light found Judas in the plain with three thousand men, although these lacked the armour and
swords they would have wished.

1 Ma 4:7 They could now see the gentile encampment with its strong fortifications and cavalry surrounding it,
clearly people who understood warfare.

1 Ma 4:8 Judas said to his men, “Do not be afraid of their numbers, and do not flinch at their attack.

IMa 4:9 Remember how our ancestors were delivered at the Red Sea when Pharaoh was pursuing them in
force.

IMa 4:10 And now let us call on Heaven: if he cares for us, he will remember his covenant with our ancestors
and will destroy this army confronting us today;

1 Ma 4:1 1 then all the nations will know for certain that there is One who ransoms and saves Israel”.

IMa 4:12 The foreigners looked up and, seeing the Jews advancing against them,

IMa 4:13 came out of the camp to join battle. Judas’ men sounded the trumpet

IMa 4:14 and engaged them. The gentiles were defeated and fled towards the plain

IMa 4:15 and all the stragglers fell by the sword. The pursuit continued as far as Gezer and the plains of



Idumaea, Azotus and Jamnia, and the enemy lost about three thousand men.

IMa 4:16 Breaking off the pursuit, Judas returned with his men

IMa 4:17 and said to the people, “Never mind the booty, for we have another battle ahead of us.

IMa 4:18 Gorgias and his troops are still near us in the mountains. First stand up to our enemies and fight them,
and then you can safely collect the booty”.

IMa 4:19 The words were hardly out of Judas’ mouth, when a detachment came into view, peering down from
the mountain.

1 Ma 4:20 Observing that their own troops had been routed and that the camp had been fired — since the smoke,
which they could see, attested the fact-

1 Ma 4:21 they were panic-stricken at the sight; and when, furthermore, they saw Judas’ troops drawn up for
battle on the plain,

IMa 4:22 they all fled into Philistine territory.

1 Ma 4:23 Judas then turned back to plunder the camp, and a large sum in gold and silver, with violet and sea-
purple stuffs, and many other valuables were carried off.

IMa 4:24 On their return, the Jews chanted praises to Fleaven, singing, “Fie is kind and his love is everlasting!”.

1 Ma 4:25 That day had seen a remarkable deliverance in Israel.

IMa 4:26 Those of the foreigners who had escaped came and gave Lysias an account of all that had happened.
IMa 4:27 The news shocked and dismayed him, for affairs in Israel had not gone as he intended, and the result
was quite the opposite to what the king had ordered.

IMa 4:28 The next year he mobilised sixty thousand picked troops and five thousand cavalry with the intention
of finishing off the Jews.

IMa 4:29 They advanced into Idumaea and made their base at Beth-Zur, where Judas met them with ten
thousand men.

IMa 4:30 When he saw their military strength he offered this prayer, “Blessed are you, Saviour of Israel, who
shattered the mighty warrior’s attack at the hand of your servant David, and delivered the Philistine camp into the
hands of Jonathan son of Saul, and his armour-bearer.

1 Ma 4:31 Crush this expedition in the same way at the hands of your people Israel; let their troops and cavalry
bring them nothing but shame.

IMa 4:32 Sow panic in their ranks, confound the confidence they put in their numbers and send them reeling in
defeat.

1 Ma 4:33 Overthrow them by the sword of those who love you, and all who acknowledge your name will sing
your praises”.

1 Ma 4:34 The two forces engaged, and five thousand men of Lysias’ troops fell in hand-to-hand fighting.

1 Ma 4:35 Seeing the rout of his army and the courage of Judas’ troops and their readiness to live or die nobly,
Lysias withdrew to Antioch, where he recruited mercenaries for a further invasion of Judaea in even greater
strength.

IMa 4:36 Judas and his brothers then said, “Now that our enemies have been defeated, let us go up to purify
the sanctuary and dedicate it”.

1 Ma 4:37 So they marshalled the whole army, and went up to Mount Zion.

1 Ma 4:38 There they found the sanctuary deserted, the altar desecrated, the gates burnt down, and vegetation
growing in the courts as it might in a wood or on some mountain, while the storerooms were in ruins.

IMa 4:39 They tore their garments and mourned bitterly, putting dust on their heads.

IMa 4:40 They prostrated themselves on the ground, and when the trumpets gave the signal they cried aloud to
Fleaven.

IMa 4:41 Judas then ordered his men to keep the Citadel garrison engaged until he had purified the sanctuary.

1 Ma 4:42 Next, he selected priests who were blameless and zealous for the Law
1 Ma 4:43 to purify the sanctuary and remove the stones of the “Pollution” to some unclean place.

1 Ma 4:44 They discussed what should be done about the altar of burnt offering which had been profaned,

1 Ma 4:45 and very properly decided to pull it down, rather than later be embarrassed about it since it had been
defiled by the gentiles. They therefore demolished it

1 Ma 4:46 and deposited the stones in a suitable place on the hill of the Dwelling to await the appearance of a
prophet who should give a ruling about them.

1 Ma 4:47 They took unhewn stones, as the Law prescribed, and built a new altar on the lines of the old one.

IMa 4:48 They restored the Holy Place and the interior of the Dwelling, and purified the courts.

1 Ma 4:49 They made new sacred vessels, and brought the lamp-stand, the altar of incense, and the table into
the Temple.

1 Ma 4:50 They burned incense on the altar and lit the lamps on the lamp-stand, and these shone inside the
Temple.

1 Ma 4:51 They placed the loaves on the table and hung the curtains and completed all the tasks they had



undertaken.

IMa 4:52 On the twenty-fifth of the ninth month, Chislev, in the year 148 they rose at dawn
1 Ma 4:53 and offered a lawful sacrifice on the new altar of burnt offering which they had made.

1 Ma 4:54 The altar was dedicated, to the sound of hymns, zithers, lyres and cymbals, at the same time of year
and on the same day on which the gentiles had originally profaned it.

IMa 4:55 The whole people fell prostrate in adoration and then praised Heaven who had granted them success.
1 Ma 4:56 For eight days they celebrated the dedication of the altar, joyfully offering burnt offerings, communion
and thanksgiving sacrifices.

IMa 4:57 They ornamented the front of the Temple with crowns and bosses of gold, renovated the gates and
storerooms, providing the latter with doors.

IMa 4:58 There was no end to the rejoicing among the people, since the disgrace inflicted by the gentiles had
been effaced.

1 Ma 4:59 Judas, with his brothers and the whole assembly of Israel, made it a law that the days of the
dedication of the altar should be celebrated yearly at the proper season, for eight days beginning on the twenty-
fifth of the month of Chislev, with rejoicing and gladness.

1 Ma 4:60 They then proceeded to build high walls with strong towers round Mount Zion, to prevent the gentiles
from coming and riding roughshod over it as in the past.

1 Ma 4:61 Judas stationed a garrison there to guard it; he also fortified Beth-Zur, so that the people would have
a fortress confronting Idumaea.

IMa 5:1 When the surrounding nations heard that the altar had been rebuilt and the sanctuary restored to what
it had been before, they became very angry

1 Ma 5:2 and decided to destroy the descendants of Jacob living among them; they began to murder and evict
our people.

IMa 5:3 Judas made war on the sons of Esau in Idumaea, in the region of Acrabattene where they were
besieging the Israelites. He dealt them a serious blow, drove them off and despoiled them.

1 Ma 5:4 He also remembered the wickedness of the sons of Baean, who were a menace and a trap for the
people with their ambushes on the roads.

1 Ma 5:5 Having blockaded them in their town and besieged them, he put them under the curse of destruction;
he then set fire to their towers and burned them down with everyone inside.

1 Ma 5:6 Next, he crossed over to the Ammonites where he found a strong fighting force and a numerous
people, commanded by Timotheus.

IMa 5:7 He fought many battles with them, defeated them and cut them to pieces.

1 Ma 5:8 Having captured Jazer and its dependent villages, he retired to Judaea.

1 Ma 5:9 Next, the gentiles of Gilead banded together to destroy the Israelites living in their territory. The latter,
however, took refuge in the fortress of Dathema,

IMa 5:10 and sent the following letter to Judas and his brothers: The gentiles round us have banded
themselves together against us to destroy us,

1 Ma 5:1 1 and they are preparing to storm the fortress in which we have taken refuge; Timotheus is in command
of their forces.

IMa 5:12 Come at once and rescue us from their clutches, for we have already suffered great losses.

IMa 5:13 All our countrymen living in Tobias’ country have been killed, their women and children have been
taken into captivity, their property has been seized, and about a thousand men have been destroyed there”.

1 Ma 5:14 While the letter was being read, other messengers arrived from Galilee with their garments torn,
bearing similar news,

IMa 5:15 “The people of Ptolemais, Tyre and Sidon have joined forces with the whole of gentile Galilee to
destroy us!”.

IMa 5:16 When Judas and the people heard this, they held a great assembly to decide what should be done for
their oppressed countrymen who were under attack from their enemies.

IMa 5:17 Judas said to his brother Simon, “Pick your men and go and relieve your countrymen in Galilee, while
my brother Jonathan and I make our way into Gilead”.

IMa 5:18 He left Joseph son of Zechariah and the people’s leader Azariah with the remainder of the army in
Judaea to keep guard, and gave them these orders,

IMa 5:19 “You are to be responsible for our people. Do not engage the gentiles until we return”.

1 Ma 5:20 Simon was allotted three thousand men for the expedition into Galilee, Judas eight thousand for
Gilead.

IMa 5:21 Simon advanced into Galilee, engaged the gentiles in several battles and swept all before him;

1 Ma 5:22 he pursued them to the gate of Ptolemais, and they lost about three thousand men, whose spoils he
collected.

1 Ma 5:23 With him, he took away the Jews of Galilee and Arbatta, with their wives and children and all their



possessions, and brought them into Judaea with great rejoicing.

IMa 5:24 Meanwhile Judas Maccabaeus and his brother Jonathan crossed the Jordan and made a three-days’
march through the desert,

IMa 5:25 where they encountered the Nabataeans, who gave them a friendly reception and told them
everything that had been happening to their brothers in Gilead,

IMa 5:26 many of whom, they said, were shut up in Bozrah and Bosor, Alema, Chaspho, Maked and Carnaim,
all large fortified towns.

1 Ma 5:27 Others were blockaded in the other towns of Gilead, and the enemy planned to attack and capture
these strongholds the very next day, and destroy all the people inside them on one day.

1 Ma 5:28 Judas and his army at once turned off by the desert road to Bozrah. He took the town and, having put
all the males to the sword and collected the booty, burned it down.

IMa 5:29 When night came, he left the place, and they continued their march until they reached the fortress.

1 Ma 5:30 In the light of dawn they looked, and there was an innumerable horde, setting up ladders and engines
to capture the fortress; the assault was just beginning.

1 Ma 5:31 When Judas saw that the attack had begun and that the war cry was rising to heaven from the city,
mingled with trumpet calls and a great clamour,

1 Ma 5:32 he said to the men of his army, “Into battle today for your brothers!”.

IMa 5:33 Dividing them into three commands, he advanced on the enemy’s rear, with trumpets sounding and
prayers shouted aloud.

IMa 5:34 The troops of Timotheus, recognising that this was Maccabaeus, fled before his advance;

Maccabaeus dealt them a crushing defeat; about eight thousand of their men fell that day.

IMa 5:35 Then, wheeling on Alema, he attacked and captured it and, having killed all the males and collected
the booty, burned the place down.

1 Ma 5:36 From there he moved on and took Chaspho, Maked, Bosor and the remaining towns of Gilead.

1 Ma 5:37 After these events, Timotheus mustered another force and pitched camp opposite Raphon, on the far
side of the stream-bed.

IMa 5:38 Judas sent men to reconnoitre the camp, and these reported back as follows, “With him are massed
all the gentiles surrounding us, making a very numerous army,

IMa 5:39 with Arab mercenaries as auxiliaries; they are encamped on the far side of the stream-bed, and ready
to launch an attack on you”. Judas then advanced to engage them,

1 Ma 5:40 and was approaching the watercourse with his troops when Timotheus told the commanders of his
army, “If he crosses first we shall not be able to resist him, because he will have a great advantage over us;

1 Ma 5:41 but if he is afraid and camps on the other side of the stream, we shall cross over to him and the
advantage will then be ours”.

IMa 5:42 As soon as Judas reached the watercourse, he posted people’s scribes along it, giving them this
order: “Do not let anyone pitch his tent; all are to go into battle!”.

1 Ma 5:43 He was himself the first across to the enemy side, with all the people following. He defeated all the
opposing gentiles, who threw down their arms and ran for refuge in the sanctuary of Carnaim.

IMa 5:44 The Jews first captured the town and then burned down the temple with everyone inside. And so
Carnaim was overthrown, and the enemy could offer no further resistance to Judas.

IMa 5:45 Next, Judas assembled all the Israelites living in Gilead, from the least to the greatest, with their
wives, children and belongings, an enormous muster, to take them to Judaea.

1 Ma 5:46 They reached Ephron, a large town straddling the road and strongly fortified. As it was impossible to
by-pass it either to right or to left, there was nothing for it but to march straight through.

IMa 5:47 But the people of the town denied them passage and barricaded the gates with stones.

1 Ma 5:48 Judas sent them a conciliatory message in these terms, “We want to pass through your territory to
reach our own; no one will do you any harm, we only want to go through on foot”. But they would not open up for
him.

1 Ma 5:49 So Judas sent an order down the column for everyone to halt where he stood.

IMa 5:50 The fighting men took up their positions; Judas attacked the town all day and night, and the town fell
to him.

1 Ma 5:51 He put all the males to the sword, razed the town to the ground, plundered it and marched through the town square over the bodies of the dead.

IMa 5:52 They then crossed the Jordan into the Great Plain, opposite Beth-Shean,

IMa 5:53 Judas all the time rallying the stragglers and encouraging the people the whole way until they reached
Judaea.

1 Ma 5:54 They climbed Mount Zion in joy and gladness and presented burnt offerings because they had
returned safe and sound without having lost a single man.

IMa 5:55 While Judas and Jonathan were in Gilead and Simon his brother in Galilee outside Ptolemais,



1 Ma 5:56 Joseph son of Zechariah, and Azariah, who were in command of the army, heard of their valiant
deeds and of the battles they had been fighting,

1 Ma 5:57 and said, “Let us make a name for ourselves too and go and fight the nations around us”.

1 Ma 5:58 So they issued orders to the men under their command and marched on Jamnia.

IMa 5:59 Gorgias and his men came out of the town and gave battle.

1 Ma 5:60 Joseph and Azariah were routed and pursued as far as the frontiers of Judaea. That day about two
thousand Israelites lost their lives.

1 Ma 5:61 Our people thus met with a great reverse, because they had not listened to Judas and his brothers,
thinking that they would do something equally valiant.

1 Ma 5:62 They were not, however, of the same breed of men as those to whom the deliverance of Israel was
entrusted.

IMa 5:63 The noble Judas and his brothers, however, were held in high honour throughout Israel and among all
the nations wherever their name was heard,

IMa 5:64 and people thronged round to acclaim them.

1 Ma 5:65 Judas marched out with his brothers to fight the Edomites in the country towards the south; he
stormed Hebron and its dependent villages, threw down its fortifications and burned down its encircling towers.
IMa 5:66 Leaving there, he made for the country of the Philistines and passed through Marisa.

1 Ma 5:67 Among the fallen in that day’s fighting were some priests who sought to prove their courage there by
joining in the battle, a foolhardy venture.

IMa 5:68 Judas next turned on Azotus, which belonged to the Philistines; he overthrew their altars, burned the
statues of their gods and, having pillaged their towns, withdrew to Judaea.

1 Ma 6:1 King Antiochus, meanwhile, was making his way through the Upper Provinces; he had heard that in
Persia there was a city called Elymais, renowned for its riches, its silver and gold,

IMa 6:2 and its very wealthy temple containing golden armour, breastplates and weapons, left there by
Alexander son of Philip, the king of Macedon, the first to reign over the Greeks.

1 Ma 6:3 He therefore went and attempted to take the city and pillage it, but without success, the citizens having
been forewarned.

1 Ma 6:4 They resisted him by force of arms. He was routed, and began retreating, very gloomily, towards
Babylon.

1 Ma 6:5 But, while he was still in Persia, news reached him that the armies which had invaded Judaea had
been routed,

1 Ma 6:6 and that Lysias in particular had advanced in massive strength, only to be forced to turn and flee before
the Jews; that the latter were now stronger than ever, thanks to the arms, supplies and abundant spoils acquired
from the armies they had cut to pieces,

1 Ma 6:7 and that they had pulled down the abomination which he had erected on the altar in Jerusalem, had
encircled the sanctuary with high walls as in the past, and had fortified Beth-Zur, one of his cities.

IMa 6:8 When the king heard this news he was amazed and profoundly shaken; he threw himself on his bed
and fell sick with grief, since things had not turned out for him as he had planned.

IMa 6:9 And there he remained for many days, subject to deep and recurrent fits of melancholy, until he
realised that he was dying.

IMa 6:10 Then, summoning all his Friends, he said to them, “Sleep evades my eyes, and my heart is cowed by
anxiety.

1 Ma 6:1 1 I have been wondering how I could have come to such a pitch of distress, so great a flood as that
which now engulfs me — 1 who was so generous and well-loved in my heyday.

IMa 6:12 But now I recall how wrongly I acted in Jerusalem when I seized all the vessels of silver and gold
there and ordered the extermination of the inhabitants of Judah for no reason at all.

IMa 6:13 This, I am convinced, is why these misfortunes have overtaken me, and why I am dying of melancholy
in a foreign land”.

1 Ma 6:14 He summoned Philip, one of his Friends, and made him regent of the whole kingdom.

IMa 6:15 He entrusted him with his diadem, his robe and his signet, on the understanding that he was to
educate his son Antiochus and train him for the throne.

IMa 6:16 King Antiochus then died, in the year 149.

IMa 6:17 Lysias, learning that the king was dead, established on the throne in succession to him his son
Antiochus, whom he had brought up from childhood — and styled him Eupator.

IMa 6:18 The people in the Citadel at the time were blockading Israel round the sanctuary and were taking
every opportunity to harm them and to support the gentiles.

IMa 6:19 Judas decided that they must be destroyed, and he mobilised the whole people to besiege them.

IMa 6:20 They assembled and laid siege to the Citadel in the year 150, building batteries and siege-engines.

1 Ma 6:21 But some of the besieged broke through the blockade, and to these a number of renegades from



Israel attached themselves.

1 Ma 6:22 They made their way to the king and said, “How much longer are you going to wait before you see
justice done and avenge our fellows?

1 Ma 6:23 We were content to serve your father, to comply with his orders, and to obey his edicts.

IMa 6:24 As a result our own people will have nothing to do with us; what is more, they have killed all those of
us they could catch, and looted our family property.

1 Ma 6:25 Nor is it on us alone that their blows have fallen, but on all your territories.

IMa 6:26 At this moment, they are laying siege to the Citadel of Jerusalem, to capture it, and they have fortified
the sanctuary and Beth-Zur.

1 Ma 6:27 Unless you forestall them at once, they will go on to even bigger things, and then you will never be
able to control them”.

IMa 6:28 The king was furious when he heard this and summoned all his Friends, the generals of his forces
and the marshals of horse.

IMa 6:29 He recruited mercenaries from other kingdoms and the Mediterranean islands.

IMa 6:30 His forces numbered a hundred thousand foot soldiers, twenty thousand cavalry and thirty-two
elephants with experience of battle conditions.

1 Ma 6:31 They advanced through Idumaea and besieged Beth-Zur, pressing the attack for days on end; they
also constructed siege-engines, but the defenders made a sortie and set these on fire, putting up a brave
resistance.

1 Ma 6:32 At this, Judas left the Citadel and pitched camp at Beth-Zechariah opposite the royal encampment.
IMa 6:33 The king rose at daybreak and marched his army at top speed down the road to Beth-Zechariah,
where his forces took up their battle formations and sounded the trumpets.

1 Ma 6:34 The elephants were given a syrup of grapes and mulberries to prepare them for the battle.

IMa 6:35 These animals were distributed among the phalanxes, to each elephant being allocated a thousand
men dressed in coats of mail with bronze helmets on their heads; five hundred picked horsemen were also
assigned to each beast.

1 Ma 6:36 The horsemen anticipated every move their elephant made; wherever it went they went with it, never
quitting it.

IMa 6:37 On each elephant, to protect it, was a stout wooden tower, kept in position by girths, each with its
three combatants, as well as its mahout.

1 Ma 6:38 The remainder of the cavalry was stationed on one or other of the two flanks of the army, to harass
the enemy and cover the phalanxes.

1 Ma 6:39 When the sun glinted on the bronze and golden shields, the mountains caught the glint and gleamed
like fiery torches.

1 Ma 6:40 One part of the royal army was deployed on the upper slopes of the mountain and the other in the
valley below; they advanced in solid, well-disciplined formation.

1 Ma 6:41 Everyone trembled at the noise made by this vast multitude, the thunder of the troops on the march
and the clanking of their armour, for it was an immense and mighty army.

IMa 6:42 Judas and his army advanced to give battle, and six hundred of the king’s army were killed.

IMa 6:43 Eleazar, called Avaran, noticing that one of the elephants was royally caparisoned and was also taller
than all the others, and supposing that the king was mounted on it,

IMa 6:44 sacrificed himself to save his people and win an imperishable name.

1 Ma 6:45 Boldly charging towards the creature through the thick of the phalanx, dealing death to right and left,
so that the enemy scattered on either side at his onslaught,

1 Ma 6:46 he darted in under the elephant, thrust at it from underneath, and killed it. The beast collapsed on top
of him, and he died on the spot.

IMa 6:47 The Jews however realising how strong the king was and how ferocious his army, retreated ahead of
them.

1 Ma 6:48 The royal army moved up to encounter them outside Jerusalem, and the king began to blockade
Judaea and Mount Zion.

1 Ma 6:49 He granted peace terms to the people of Beth-Zur, who evacuated the town; it lacked store of
provisions to withstand a siege, since the land was enjoying a sabbatical year.

IMa 6:50 Having occupied Beth-Zur, the king stationed a garrison there to hold it.

1 Ma 6:51 He besieged the sanctuary for a long time, erecting batteries and siege-engines, flame-throwers and
ballistas, scorpions to discharge arrows, and catapults.

1 Ma 6:52 The defenders countered these by constructing their own engines and were thus able to prolong their
resistance.

1 Ma 6:53 But they had no food in their stores since it was the seventh year, and because those who had taken
refuge in Judaea from the gentiles had eaten up the last of their reserves.



1 Ma 6:54 Only a few men were left in the Holy Place, owing to the severity of the famine; the rest had dispersed
and gone home.

IMa 6:55 Meanwhile Philip, whom King Antiochus before his death had appointed to train his son Antiochus for
the throne,

IMa 6:56 had returned from Persia and Media with the forces that had accompanied the king, and was planning
to seize control of affairs.

1 Ma 6:57 On hearing this, Lysias at once decided to leave, and said to the king, the generals of the army and
the men, “We are growing weaker every day, we are short of food, and the place we are besieging is well
fortified; moreover the affairs of the kingdom demand our attention.

1 Ma 6:58 Let us offer the hand of friendship to these men and make peace with them and with their whole
nation.

1 Ma 6:59 Let us grant them permission to follow their own customs as before, since it is our abolition of these
customs that has provoked them into acting like this”.

IMa 6:60 The king and his commanders approved this argument, and he offered the Jews peace terms, which
they accepted.

1 Ma 6:61 The king and the generals ratified the treaty by oath, and the besieged accordingly left the fortress.
IMa 6:62 The king then entered Mount Zion, but on seeing how impregnable the place was, he broke the oath
he had sworn and gave orders for the encircling wall to be demolished.

1 Ma 6:63 He then hurriedly withdrew, making off for Antioch, where he found Philip already master of the city.
Antiochus gave battle and captured the city by force of arms.

IMa 7:1 In the year 151 , Demetrius son of Seleucus left Rome and arrived with a few men at a town on the
coast, where he inaugurated his reign.

IMa 7:2 It so happened that, as he was entering the royal residence of his ancestors, the army captured
Antiochus and Lysias, and intended to bring them to him.

1 Ma 7:3 On hearing this, he said, “Keep them out of my sight”.

1 Ma 7:4 The army put them to death, and Demetrius ascended his throne.

IMa 7:5 Next, all those Israelites without law or piety, led by Alcimus, whose ambition was to become high
priest,

IMa 7:6 approached the king and denounced our people to him. “Judas and his brothers”, they said, “have killed
all your friends, and he has driven us out of our country.

1 Ma 7:7 Send someöne now whom you can trust; let him go and see the wholesale ruin Judas has brought on
us and on the king’s dominions, and let him punish the wretches and all who assist them”.

IMa 7:8 The king chose Bacchides, one of the Friends of the King, governor of Transeuphrates, an important
personage in the kingdom and loyal to the king.

IMa 7:9 He sent him with the godless Alcimus, whom he confirmed in the high priesthood, with orders to exact
retribution from the Israelites.

IMa 7:10 So they set out with a large force and, on reaching Judaea, sent emissaries to Judas and his brothers
with proposals peaceable yet treacherous.

1 Ma 7:1 1 The latter, however, did not put any faith in their words, aware that they had come with a large force.
IMa 7:12 Nevertheless, a commission of scribes presented themselves before Alcimus and Bacchides, to sue
for just terms.

IMa 7:13 The first among the Israelites to ask them for peace terms were the Hasidaeans,

IMa 7:14 who reasoned thus, “This is a priest of Aaron’s line who has come with the armed forces; he will not
wrong us”.

IMa 7:15 He did in fact discuss peace terms with them and gave them his oath, “We shall not attempt to injure
you or your friends”.

IMa 7:16 They believed him, but he arrested sixty of them and put them to death on one day, fulfilling the words
of scripture:

IMa 7:17 They have scattered the bodies of your faithful, and shed their blood all round Jerusalem, leaving no
one to bury them!

IMa 7:18 At this, fear and dread gripped the whole people. “There is no truth or virtue in them”, they said, “they
have broken their agreement and their sworn oath”.

IMa 7:19 Bacchides then left Jerusalem and encamped at Beth-Zeth, and from there sent and arrested many of
the men who had deserted him and a few of our people too; he had them killed and thrown down the great well.

1 Ma 7:20 He then put Alcimus in charge of the province, leaving an army with him to support him; Bacchides
himself returned to the king.

IMa 7:21 Alcimus continued his struggle to become high priest,

IMa 7:22 and all who were disturbing the peace of their own people rallied to him, and, having won control of
Judaea, did much harm in Israel.



1 Ma 7:23 Seeing that all the wrongs done to the Israelites by Alcimus and his supporters exceeded what the
gentiles had done,

1 Ma 7:24 Judas went right round the whole territory of Judaea to take vengeance on those who had deserted
him and to prevent their free movement about the country.

IMa 7:25 When Alcimus saw how strong Judas and his supporters had grown and realised that he was
powerless to resist them, he went back to the king, to whom he made malicious accusations against them.

1 Ma 7:26 The king sent Nicanor, one of his generals ranking as Illustrious and a bitter enemy of Israel, with
orders to exterminate the people.

IMa 7:27 Reaching Jerusalem with a large force, Nicanor sent a friendly, yet treacherous, message to Judas
and his brothers, as follows:

IMa 7:28 “Let us have no fighting between you and me; I shall come with a small escort for a peaceful meeting
with you”.

IMa 7:29 He met Judas and they exchanged friendly greetings; the enemy, however, had made preparations to
abduct Judas.

IMa 7:30 When Judas became aware of Nicanor’s treacherous purpose in coming to see him, he took fright and
refused any further meeting.

1 Ma 7:31 Nicanor then realised that his plan had been discovered, and took the field against Judas, to give
battle near Caphar-Salama.

1 Ma 7:32 About five hundred of Nicanor’s men fell; the rest took refuge in the City of David.

1 Ma 7:33 After these events Nicanor went up to Mount Zion. Some of the priests came out of the Holy Place
with some elders, to give him a friendly welcome and show him the burnt offering being presented for the king.
IMa 7:34 But he ridiculed them, laughed at them, defiled them and used insolent language, swearing in his
rage,

1 Ma 7:35 “Unless Judas is handed over to me this time with his army, as soon as I am safely back, I promise
you, I shall burn this building down!”.

1 Ma 7:36 Then he went off in a fury. At this, the priests went in again, and stood weeping in front of the altar
and the Temple, saying,

1 Ma 7:37 “You have chosen this house to be called by your name, to be a house of prayer and petition for your
people.

1 Ma 7:38 Take vengeance on this man and on his army, and let them fall by the sword; remember their
blasphemies and give them no respite”.

1 Ma 7:39 Nicanor left Jerusalem and encamped at Beth-Horon, where he was joined by an army from Syria.
IMa 7:40 Judas, meanwhile, camped at Adasa with three thousand men, and offered this prayer,

1 Ma 7:41 “When the king’s envoys blasphemed, your angel went out and struck down one hundred and eighty-
five thousand of his men.

1 Ma 7:42 In the same way let us see you crush this army today, so that everyone else may know that this man
has spoken blasphemously against your sanctuary: pass judgement on him as his wickedness deserves!”.

IMa 7:43 The armies met in battle on the thirteenth of the month Adar, and Nicanor’s army was crushed, he
himself being the first to fall in the battle.

1 Ma 7:44 When Nicanor’s soldiers saw him fall, they threw down their arms and fled.

1 Ma 7:45 The Jews pursued them a day’s journey, from Adasa to the approaches of Gezer; they sounded their
trumpets in warning as they followed them,

1 Ma 7:46 and people came out of all the surrounding Judaean villages to encircle the fugitives, who then turned
back on their own men. All fell by the sword, not one being left alive.

IMa 7:47 Having collected the spoils and booty, they cut off Nicanor’s head and the right hand he had stretched
out in a display of insolence; these were taken and displayed within sight of Jerusalem.

1 Ma 7:48 The people were overjoyed and kept that day as a great holiday:

IMa 7:49 indeed they decided to celebrate it annually on the thirteenth of Adar.

1 Ma 7:50 For a short while Judaea enjoyed peace.

1 Ma 8:1 Now Judas had heard of the reputation of the Romans: how strong they were, and how well disposed
towards any who made common cause with them, making a treaty of friendship with anyone who approached
them.

1 Ma 8:2 (And, indeed, they were extremely powerful.) He had been told of their wars and of their prowess
among the Gauls, whom they had conquered and put under tribute;

1 Ma 8:3 and of all they had done in the province of Spain to gain possession of the silver and gold mines there,
IMa 8:4 making themselves masters of the whole country by their determination and perseverance, despite its
great distance from their own; of the kings who came from the ends of the earth to attack them, only to be
crushed by them and overwhelmed with disaster, and of others who paid them annual tribute;

1 Ma 8:5 Philip, Perseus king of the Kittim, and others who had dared to make war on them, had been defeated



and reduced to subjection,

IMa 8:6 while Antiochus the Great, king of Asia, who had advanced to attack them with a hundred and twenty
elephants, cavalry, chariots and a very large army, had also suffered defeat at their hands;

IMa 8:7 they had taken him alive and imposed on him and his successors, on agreed terms, the payment of an
enormous tribute, the surrender of hostages, and the cession

1 Ma 8:8 of the Indian territory, with Media, Lydia, and some of their best provinces, which they took from him
and gave to King Eumenes.

IMa 8:9 Judas had also heard how, when the Greeks planned an expedition to destroy the Romans,

IMa 8:10 the latter had got wind of it and, sending a single general against them, had fought a campaign in
which they inflicted heavy casualties, carried their women and children away into captivity, pillaged their goods,
subdued their country, tore down their fortresses and reduced them to a slavery lasting to the present day;

1 Ma 8:1 1 and how they had destroyed and subjugated all the other kingdoms and islands that resisted them.
IMa 8:12 But where their friends and those who relied on them were concerned, they had always stood by their
friendship. They had subdued kings far and near, and all who heard their name went in terror of them.

IMa 8:13 One man, if they determined to help him and advance him to a throne, would certainly occupy it, while
another, if they so determined, would find himself deposed; their influence was paramount.

1 Ma 8:14 In spite of all this, no single one of them had assumed a crown or put on the purple for his own
aggrandisement.

IMa 8:15 They had set up a senate, where three hundred and twenty councillors deliberated daily, constantly
debating how best to regulate public affairs.

IMa 8:16 They entrusted their government to one man for a year at a time, with absolute power over their whole
empire, and this man was obeyed by all without envy or jealousy.

IMa 8:17 Having chosen Eupolemus son of John, of the family of Accos, and Jason son of Eleazar, Judas sent
them to Rome to make a treaty of friendship and alliance with these people,

IMa 8:18 in the hope of being rid of the yoke, for they could see that Greek rule was reducing Israel to slavery.
IMa 8:19 The envoys made the lengthy journey to Rome and presented themselves before the Senate with
their formal proposal:

IMa 8:20 “Judas Maccabaeus and his brothers, with the Jewish people, have sent us to you to conclude a treaty
of alliance and peace with you, and to enrol ourselves as your allies and friends”.

1 Ma 8:21 The proposal met with the approval of the senators.

1 Ma 8:22 Here is a copy of the rescript which they engraved on bronze tablets and sent to Jerusalem to be kept
there by the Jews as a record of peace and alliance:

IMa 8:23 “Good fortune attend the Romans and the Jewish nation by sea and land for ever; may sword or
enemy be far from them!

1 Ma 8:24 “If war comes first to Rome or any of her allies throughout her dominions,

1 Ma 8:25 the Jewish nation will take action as her ally, as occasion may require, and do it wholeheartedly.

1 Ma 8:26 They will not give or supply to the enemy any grain, arms, money or ships: thus has Rome decided,
and they are to honour their obligations without guarantees.

1 Ma 8:27 In the same way, if war comes first to the Jewish nation, the Romans will support them energetically
as occasion may offer,

1 Ma 8:28 and the aggressor will not be furnished with grain, arms, money or ships: such is the Roman decision,
and they will honour these obligations without treachery.

1 Ma 8:29 Such are the articles under which the Romans have concluded their treaty with the Jewish people.

1 Ma 8:30 If, later, either party should decide to make any addition or deletion, they will be free to do so, and any
such addition or deletion will be binding.

1 Ma 8:31 “As regards the wrongs done to them by King Demetrius, we have written to him in these terms: Why
have you made your yoke lie heavy on our friends and allies the Jews?

1 Ma 8:32 If they appeal against you again, we shall uphold their rights and make war on you by sea and land”.

1 Ma 9:1 Demetrius, hearing that Nicanor and his army had fallen in battle, sent Bacchides and Alcimus a
second time into Judaea, and with them the right wing of his army.

IMa 9:2 They took the road to Galilee and besieged Mesaloth in Arbela, and captured it, putting many people to
death.

IMa 9:3 In the first month of the year 152, they encamped outside Jerusalem;

1 Ma 9:4 they then moved on, making their way to Beer-Zaith with twenty thousand foot and two thousand horse.
IMa 9:5 Judas lay in camp at Elasa, with three thousand picked men.

1 Ma 9:6 When they saw the huge size of the enemy forces they were terrified, and many slipped out of the
camp, until no more than eight hundred of the force were left.

IMa 9:7 With battle now inevitable, Judas realised that his army had melted away; he was aghast, for he had no
time to rally them.



1 Ma 9:8 Yet, dismayed as he was, he said to those who were left, “Up! Let us face the enemy; we may yet have
the strength to fight them”.

1 Ma 9:9 His men tried to dissuade him, declaring, “We have no strength for anything but to escape with our lives
this time; then we can come back with our brothers to fight them; by ourselves we are too few”.

IMa 9:10 Judas retorted, “That I should do such a thing as run away from them! If our time has come, at least
let us die like men for our countrymen, and leave nothing to tarnish our reputation”.

1 Ma 9:1 1 The army marched out of camp and drew up, facing the enemy. The cavalry was drawn up in two
squadrons; the slingers and archers marched in the van of the army, and all the best fighters were put in the
front rank;

IMa 9:12 Bacchides was on the right wing. The phalanx advanced from between the two squadrons, sounding
the trumpets; the men on Judas’ side also blew their trumpets,

IMa 9:13 and the earth shook with the noise of the armies. The engagement lasted from morning until evening.
IMa 9:14 Judas saw that Bacchides and the main strength of his army lay on the right; all the stout-hearted
rallied to him,

IMa 9:15 and they crushed the right wing, pursuing them as far as the Azara Hills.

IMa 9:16 But when the Syrians on the left wing saw that the right had been broken, they turned and followed
hot on the heels of Judas and his men to take them in the rear.

IMa 9:17 The fight became desperate, and there were many casualties on both sides.

IMa 9:18 Judas himself fell, and the remnant fled.

IMa 9:19 Jonathan and Simon took up their brother Judas and buried him in his ancestral tomb at Modein.

IMa 9:20 All Israel wept and mourned him deeply and for many days they repeated this dirge.

1 Ma 9:21 “What a downfall for the strong man, the man who kept Israel safe!”.

1 Ma 9:22 The other deeds of Judas, the battles he fought, the exploits he performed, and all his titles to
greatness have not been recorded; but they were very many.

1 Ma 9:23 After the death of Judas, the renegades came out of hiding throughout Israel and all the evil-doers
reappeared.

1 Ma 9:24 At that time there was a severe famine, and the country went over to their side.

1 Ma 9:25 Bacchides deliberately chose the enemies of religion to administer the country.

1 Ma 9:26 These traced and searched out the friends of Judas and brought them before Bacchides, who ill-
treated and mocked them.

1 Ma 9:27 A terrible oppression began in Israel; there had been nothing like it since the disappearance of
prophecy among them.

IMa 9:28 The friends of Judas then all united in saying to Jonathan,

1 Ma 9:29 “Since your brother Judas died, there has been no one like him to head the resistance against our
enemies, people like Bacchides and others who hate our nation.

1 Ma 9:30 Accordingly, we have today chosen you to take his place as our ruler and leader and to fight our
campaigns”.

1 Ma 9:31 Whereüpon, Jonathan took command, in succession to his brother Judas.

IMa 9:32 Bacchides, when he heard the news, made plans to kill Jonathan.

1 Ma 9:33 But this became known to Jonathan, his brother Simon and all his supporters, and they took refuge in
the desert of Tekoa, camping by the water-supply at Asphar storage-well.

1 Ma 9:34 (Bacchides came to know of this on the Sabbath day, and he too crossed the Jordan with his entire
army.)

IMa 9:35 Jonathan sent his brother, who was one of his commanders, to ask his friends the Nabataeans to
store their considerable baggage for them.

IMa 9:36 The sons of Amrai, however, those of Medeba, intercepted them, captured John and everything he
had and made off with their prize.

1 Ma 9:37 Later, Jonathan and his brother Simon were told that the sons of Amrai were celebrating an important
wedding, and were escorting the bride, a daughter of one of the great notables of Canaan, from Nabata with a
large retinue.

1 Ma 9:38 Remembering the bloody end of their brother John, they went up and hid under cover of the mountain.
1 Ma 9:39 As they were keeping watch, a noisy procession came into sight with a great deal of baggage, and the
bridegroom, with his groomsmen and his family, came out to meet it with tambourines and a band, and rich,
warlike display.

IMa 9:40 The Jews rushed down on them from their ambush and killed them, inflicting heavy casualties; the
survivors escaped to the mountain, leaving their entire baggage train to be captured.

1 Ma 9:41 Thus, the wedding was turned into mourning and the music of their band into lamentation.

1 Ma 9:42 Having in this way avenged in full the blood of their brother, they returned to the marshes of the
Jordan.



IMa 9:43 As soon as Bacchides heard this, he came on the Sabbath day with a considerable force to the steep
banks of the Jordan.

1 Ma 9:44 Jonathan said to his men, “Up! Let us fight for our lives, for today it is not as in the old days.

1 Ma 9:45 You can see, we shall have to fight on our front and to our rear; we have the waters of the Jordan on
one side, the marsh and scrub on the other, and we have no line of withdrawal.

1 Ma 9:46 This is the moment to call on Heaven, to deliver you from the clutches of your enemies”.

IMa 9:47 The engagement was begun by Jonathan, who aimed a blow at Bacchides, but the Syrian disengaged
himself and withdrew,

IMa 9:48 whereüpon Jonathan and his men leapt into the Jordan and swam to the other bank; the enemy did
not, however, cross the Jordan in pursuit.

1 Ma 9:49 That day, Bacchides lost about a thousand men.

1 Ma 9:50 Bacchides went back to Jerusalem and began fortifying some of the Judaean towns: the fortresses of
Jericho, Emmaus, Beth-Horon, Bethel, Timnath, Pharathon and Tephon, with high walls and barred gates,

1 Ma 9:51 and stationed a garrison in each of them to harass Israel.

1 Ma 9:52 He also fortified the town of Beth-Zur, Gezer and the Citadel, and placed troops in them with supplies
of provisions.

1 Ma 9:53 He took the sons of the leading men of the country as hostages, and had them placed under guard in
the Citadel of Jerusalem.

1 Ma 9:54 In the year 1 53, in the second month, Alcimus ordered the demolition of the wall of the inner court of
the sanctuary, destroying the work of the prophets. Alcimus had just begun the demolition
IMa 9:55 when he suffered a stroke, and his work was interrupted. His mouth became obstructed, and his
paralysis made him incapable of speaking at all or giving directions to his household;

1 Ma 9:56 it was not long before he died in great agony.

1 Ma 9:57 On the death of Alcimus, Bacchides went back to the king, and Judaea was left in peace for two
years.

IMa 9:58 The renegades then all agreed on a plan. “Now is the time”, they said, “while Jonathan and his
supporters are living in peace and are full of confidence, for us to bring back Bacchides, and he will arrest the lot
of them in one night”.

1 Ma 9:59 So they went to him and reached an understanding.

1 Ma 9:60 Bacchides at once set out with a large force, and sent secret instructions to all his allies in Judaea to
seize Jonathan and his supporters. But they were unable to do this because their plan became known,

1 Ma 9:61 and Jonathan and his men arrested some fifty of the men of the country who were ringleaders in the
plot, and put them to death.

1 Ma 9:62 Jonathan and Simon then retired with their partisans to Beth-Bassi in the desert; they rebuilt the
ruinous parts of the place and fortified it.

IMa 9:63 When Bacchides heard this, he mustered his whole force and notified his adherents in Judaea.

IMa 9:64 He then proceeded to lay siege to Beth-Bassi, the fighting was protracted, and he constructed siege-
engines.

IMa 9:65 Jonathan, however, leaving his brother Simon in the town, broke out into the countryside with a
handful of men.

1 Ma 9:66 He launched a blow at Odomera and his brothers, and at the sons of Phasiron in their encampment;
whereüpon, these too came into the struggle, joining forces with him.

1 Ma 9:67 Simon and his people, meanwhile, made a sortie from the town and set fire to the siege-engines.

IMa 9:68 Taking the offensive against Bacchides, they defeated him. He was greatly disconcerted to find that
his plan and his assault had come to nothing,

1 Ma 9:69 and vented his anger on those renegades who had induced him to enter the country, putting many of
them to death; he then decided to take his own troops home.

1 Ma 9:70 Discovering this, Jonathan sent envoys to negotiate peace terms and the release of prisoners with
him.

1 Ma 9:71 Bacchides agreed to this, accepting his proposals and swearing never to seek occasion to harm him
for the rest of his life.

1 Ma 9:72 Having surrendered to Jonathan those prisoners he had earlier taken in Judaea, he turned about and
withdrew to his own country, and never again came near their frontiers.

IMa 9:73 The sword no longer hung over Israel, and Jonathan settled in Michmash, where he began to judge
the people and to rid Israel of the godless.

IMa 10:1 In the year 160, Alexander, son of Antiochus Epiphanes, raised an army and occupied Ptolemais. He
was well received, and there inaugurated his reign.

IMa 10:2 On hearing this, King Demetrius assembled a very large army and marched off to do battle with him.
IMa 10:3 Demetrius furthermore sent Jonathan a most conciliatory letter, promising to promote him in rank,



IMa 10:4 for, as he said, “We had better move first to come to terms with these people before he makes
common cause with Alexander against us;

IMa 10:5 he will not have forgotten all the wrongs we inflicted on him and his brothers, and on his nation”.

IMa 10:6 He even authorised him to raise an army, to manufacture arms, and to describe himself as his ally,
and ordered the hostages in the Citadel to be surrendered to him.

1 Ma 1 0:7 Jonathan went straight to Jerusalem and read the letter in the hearing of the whole people and of the
men in the Citadel.

IMa 10:8 They were terrified when they heard that the king had given him authority to raise an army.

IMa 10:9 The men in the Citadel surrendered the hostages to Jonathan, who handed them back to their
parents.

IMa 10:10 Jonathan then took up residence in Jerusalem and began the rebuilding and restoration of the city.
IMa 10:1 1 He ordered those responsible for the work to build the walls and the defences round Mount Zion of
squared stone blocks to make them stronger, and this was done.

IMa 10:12 The foreigners in the fortresses built by Bacchides abandoned them,

IMa 10:13 one after another leaving his post to go back to his own country.

IMa 10:14 Only at Beth-Zur were a few left of those who had forsaken the Law and the precepts, since this was
their refuge.

IMa 10:15 King Alexander heard of all the promises Demetrius had sent to Jonathan, and he was also given an
account of the battles and exploits of this man and his brothers and of the hardships they had endured.

IMa 10:16 “Shall we ever find another man like him?”. he exclaimed. “We must make him our friend and ally!”.

IMa 10:17 He therefore wrote him a letter, addressing him in these terms:

IMa 10:18 “King Alexander to his brother Jonathan, greetings.

IMa 10:19 “You have been brought to our notice as a strong man of action and as someöne who deserves to be
our friend.

1 Ma 1 0:20 Accordingly, we have today appointed you high priest of your nation, with the title of ‘Friend of the
King’” — he also sent him a purple robe and a golden crown-'and you are to study our interests and maintain
friendly relations with us”.

IMa 10:21 Jonathan put on the sacred vestments in the seventh month of the year 160, on the feast of Shelters;
he then set about raising troops and manufacturing arms in quantity.

IMa 10:22 Demetrius was displeased when he heard what had happened.

1 Ma 1 0:23 “What have we been doing”, he said, “for Alexander to forestall us in winning the friendship of the
Jews and so improving his own position?

IMa 10:24 I too shall address an appeal to them, offering them advancement and riches as an inducement to
support me”.

IMa 10:25 And he wrote to them as follows: “King Demetrius to the Jewish nation, greetings.

1 Ma 1 0:26 “We have heard how you have kept your agreement with us and have maintained friendly relations
with us and have not gone over to our enemies, and it has given us great satisfaction.

1 Ma 1 0:27 If you now continue to keep faith with us, we shall make you a handsome return for what you do on
our behalf.

1 Ma 1 0:28 We shall accord you many exemptions and grant you privileges.

IMa 10:29 “Henceforth I release you and exempt all the Jews from the tribute, the salt dues and the crown
levies,

1 Ma 1 0:30 and whereäs I am entitled to one-third of the grain and one-half of the fruit of the trees, I release from
this levy, from today and for the future, Judaea and the three districts annexed to it from Samaria-Galilee, from
this day henceforth in perpetuity.

IMa 10:31 Jerusalem will be sacred and exempt, with its territory, from tithes and dues.

1 Ma 1 0:32 I relinquish control of the Citadel in Jerusalem and make it over to the high priest, so that he may
man it with a garrison of his own choosing.

1 Ma 1 0:33 Every Jewish person taken from Judaea into captivity in any part of my kingdom I set free without
ransom, and decree that all will be exempt from taxes, even on their livestock.

IMa 10:34 All festivals, Sabbaths, New Moons and days of special observance, and the three days before and
three days after a festival, will be days of exemption and quittance for all the Jews in my kingdom,

1 Ma 1 0:35 and no one will have the right to exact payment from, or to molest, any of them for any matter
whatsoëver.

1 Ma 1 0:36 “Jews will be enrolled in the king’s forces to the number of thirty thousand men and receive
maintenance on the same scale as the rest of the king’s forces.

IMa 10:37 Some of them will be stationed in the king’s major fortresses, and from among others appointments
will be made to positions of trust in the kingdom. Their officers and commanders will be appointed from their own
number and will live under their own laws, as the king has prescribed for Judaea.



IMa 10:38 “As regards the three districts annexed to Judaea from the province of Samaria, these will be
integrated into Judaea and considered as coming under one governor, obeying the high priest’s authority and no
other.

IMa 10:39 Ptolemais and the land thereto pertaining I present to the sanctuary in Jerusalem, to meet the
necessary expenses of public worship.

IMa 10:40 And I make a personal grant of fifteen thousand silver shekels annually chargeable to the royal
revenue from appropriate places.

IMa 10:41 And the entire surplus, which has not been paid in by the officials as in previous years, will
henceforth be paid over by them for work on the Temple.

1 Ma 1 0:42 In addition, the sum of five thousand silver shekels, levied annually on the profits of the sanctuary, as
shown in the annual accounts, is also relinquished as the perquisite of the priests who perform the liturgy.

IMa 10:43 Anyone who takes refuge in the Temple in Jerusalem or any of its precincts, when in debt to the
royal exchequer or otherwise, will be discharged in full possession of all the goods he owns in my kingdom.

1 Ma 1 0:44 As regards the building and restoration of the sanctuary, the expense of the work will be met from
the royal exchequer.

IMa 10:45 The reconstruction of the walls of Jerusalem and the fortification of the perimeter will also be a
charge on the royal exchequer, as also the reconstruction of other city walls in Judaea”.

IMa 10:46 When Jonathan and the people heard these proposals, they put no faith in them and refused to
accept them, remembering what great wrongs Demetrius had done to Israel and how cruelly he had oppressed
them.

IMa 10:47 They decided in favour of Alexander, since he seemed to offer the better inducements of the two,
and they became his constant allies.

IMa 10:48 King Alexander now mustered large forces and advanced against Demetrius.

IMa 10:49 The two kings met in battle. Alexander’s army was routed, and Demetrius pursued him and defeated
his troops.

IMa 10:50 He continued the battle with vigour until sunset. Demetrius himself, however, was killed the same
day.

IMa 10:51 Alexander sent ambassadors to Ptolemy king of Egypt, with this message:

IMa 10:52 “Since I have returned to my kingdom, have ascended the throne of my ancestors, have gained
control by crushing Demetrius, and so recovered our country-

IMa 10:53 for I fought him and we crushed both him and his army, and I now occupy his royal throne-

1 Ma 1 0:54 let us now make a treaty of friendship. Give me your daughter in marriage: as your son-in-law, I shall

give you, and her, presents which are worthy of you”.

IMa 10:55 King Ptolemy replied as follows: “Happy the day when you returned to the land of your ancestors and
ascended their royal throne!

1 Ma 1 0:56 I shall at once do for you what your letter proposes; but meet me at Ptolemais, so that we can see
one another, and I shall become your father-in-law, as you have asked”.

IMa 10:57 Ptolemy left Egypt with his daughter Cleopatra and reached Ptolemais in the year 162.

1 Ma 1 0:58 King Alexander went to meet him, and Ptolemy gave him the hand of his daughter Cleopatra and

celebrated her wedding in Ptolemais with great magnificence, as kings do.

1 Ma 1 0:59 King Alexander then wrote to Jonathan to come and meet him.

1 Ma 1 0:60 Jonathan made his way in state to Ptolemais and met the two kings; he gave them and their friends
silver and gold, and many gifts, and made a favourable impression on them.

1 Ma 1 0:61 A number of scoundrels, the pest of Israel, combined to denounce him, but the king paid no attention
to them.

IMa 10:62 In fact, the king commanded that Jonathan should be divested of his own garments and clothed in
the purple, which was done.

IMa 10:63 The king then seated him by his side and said to his officers, “Escort him into the centre of the city
and proclaim that no one is to bring charges against him on any count; no one is to molest him for any reason”.
IMa 10:64 And so, when his accusers saw the honour done him by this proclamation, and Jonathan himself
invested in the purple, they all fled.

1 Ma 1 0:65 The king did him the honour of enrolling him among the First Friends, and appointed him
commander-in-chief and governor-general.

IMa 10:66 Jonathan then returned to Jerusalem in peace and gladness.

IMa 10:67 In the year 165, Demetrius son of Demetrius came from Crete to the land of his ancestors.

1 Ma 1 0:68 When King Alexander heard of it he was plunged into gloom, and retired to Antioch.

1 Ma 1 0:69 Demetrius confirmed Apollonius as governor of Coele-Syria; the latter assembled a large force,
encamped at Jamnia and sent the following message to Jonathan the high priest:

1 Ma 1 0:70 “You are entirely alone in rising against us, and now I find myself ridiculed and reproached on your



account. Why do you use your authority to our disadvantage in the mountains?

IMa 10:71 If you are so confident in your forces, come down now to meet us on the plain and let us take each
other’s measure there; on my side I have the strength of the towns.

1 Ma 1 0:72 Ask and learn who I am and who the others supporting us are. You will hear that you cannot stand
up to us, since your ancestors were twice routed on their own ground,

1 Ma 1 0:73 nor will you now be able to withstand the cavalry or so great an army on the plain, where there is
neither rock, nor stone, nor refuge of any kind”.

IMa 10:74 On hearing Apollonius’ words, Jonathan’s spirit was roused; he picked ten thousand men and left
Jerusalem, and his brother Simon joined him with reinforcements.

IMa 10:75 He drew up his forces outside Joppa, the citizens having shut him out, since Apollonius had a
garrison in Joppa. When they began the attack,

1 Ma 1 0:76 the citizens took fright and opened the gates, and Jonathan occupied Joppa.

1 Ma 1 0:77 Hearing this, Apollonius marshalled three thousand cavalry and a large army and made his way to
Azotus as though intending to march through, while in fact pressing on into the plain, since he had a great
number of cavalry on which he was relying.

1 Ma 1 0:78 Jonathan pursued him as far as Azotus, where the armies joined battle.

1 Ma 1 0:79 Now, Apollonius had left a thousand horsemen in concealment behind them.

IMa 10:80 Jonathan knew of this enemy position behind him; the horsemen surrounded his army, firing their
arrows into his men from morning till evening.

IMa 10:81 But the troops stood firm, as Jonathan had ordered. Once the cavalry was exhausted,

1 Ma 1 0:82 Simon sent his own troops into attack against the phalanx, which he cut to pieces and routed.

IMa 10:83 The cavalry scattered over the plain and fled to Azotus, where they took sanctuary in Beth-Dagon,
the temple of their idol.

IMa 10:84 Jonathan, however, set fire to Azotus and the surrounding towns, plundered them, and burned down
the temple of Dagon, with all the fugitives who had crowded into it.

1 Ma 1 0:85 The enemy losses, counting those who fell by the sword and those burnt to death, totalled about
eight thousand men.

IMa 10:86 Jonathan then left and pitched camp outside Ascalon, where the citizens came out to meet him with
great ceremony.

IMa 10:87 Jonathan then returned to Jerusalem with his followers, laden with booty.

IMa 10:88 In the event, when King Alexander heard what had happened, he awarded Jonathan further
honours:

IMa 10:89 he sent him the golden brooch, of the kind customarily presented to the King’s Cousins, and gave
him proprietary rights over Ekron and the land adjoining it.

IMa 11:1 The king of Egypt then assembled an army as numerous as the sands of the seashore, with many
ships, and set out to take possession of Alexander’s kingdom by a ruse and add it to his own kingdom.

1 Ma 1 1 :2 He set off for Syria with protestations of peace, and the people of the towns opened their gates to him
and came out to meet him, since King Alexander’s orders were to welcome him, Ptolemy being his father-in-law.
1 Ma 1 1 :3 On entering the towns, however, Ptolemy quartered troops as a garrison in each one.

IMa 1 1 :4 When he reached Azotus he was shown the burnt-out temple of Dagon, with Azotus and its suburbs
in ruins, corpses scattered here and there, and the charred remains of those whom Jonathan had burnt to death
in the battle, piled into heaps along his route.

IMa 1 1 :5 They explained to the king what Jonathan had done, hoping for his disapproval; but the king said
nothing.

IMa 11:6 Jonathan went in state to meet the king at Joppa, where they greeted each other and spent the night.
IMa 1 1 :7 Jonathan accompanied the king as far as the river called Eleutherus, and then returned to Jerusalem.
IMa 11:8 King Ptolemy for his part occupied the coastal towns as far as Seleucia on the coast, all the while
maturing his wicked designs against Alexander.

1 Ma 1 1 :9 He sent envoys to King Demetrius to say, “Come and let us make a treaty; I shall give you my
daughter, whom Alexander now has, and you shall rule your father’s kingdom.

IMa 1 1:10 I regret having given my daughter to that man, since he has tried to kill me”.

1 Ma 11:11 He made this accusation because he coveted his kingdom.

IMa 11:12 Having carried off his daughter and bestowed her on Demetrius, he broke with Alexander, and their
enmity became open.

IMa 11:13 Ptolemy next entered Antioch and assumed the crown of Asia; he now wore on his head the two
crowns of Egypt and Asia.

IMa 11:14 King Alexander was in Cilicia at the time, since the people of those parts had risen in revolt,

IMa 11:15 but when he heard the news, he advanced on his rival to give battle, while Ptolemy for his part also
took the field, met him with a strong force and routed him.



IMa 11:16 Alexander fled to Arabia for refuge, and King Ptolemy reigned supreme.

IMa 11:17 Zabdiel the Arab cut off Alexander’s head and sent it to Ptolemy.

IMa 11:18 Three days later King Ptolemy died, and the Egyptian garrisons in the strongholds were killed by the
local inhabitants.

IMa 11:19 So Demetrius became king in the year 167.

1 Ma 1 1 :20 At the same time, Jonathan mustered the men of Judaea for an assault on the Citadel of Jerusalem,
and they set up numerous siege-engines against it.

IMa 1 1 :21 But some renegades who hated their nation made their way to the king and told him that Jonathan
was besieging the Citadel.

1 Ma 1 1 :22 The king was angered by the news. No sooner had he been informed than he set out and came to
Ptolemais. He wrote to Jonathan, telling him to raise the siege and to meet him for a conference in Ptolemais as
soon as possible.

1 Ma 1 1 :23 When Jonathan heard this, he gave orders for the siege to continue; he then selected a deputation
from the elders of Israel and the priests, and took the deliberate risk

1 Ma 1 1 :24 of himself taking silver and gold, clothing and numerous other presents, and going to Ptolemais to
face the king, whose favour he succeeded in winning;

1 Ma 1 1 :25 and although one or two renegades of his nation brought charges against him,

IMa 11:26 the king treated him as his predecessors had treated him, and promoted him in the presence of all
his friends.

1 Ma 1 1 :27 He confirmed him in the high-priesthood and whatever other distinctions he already held, and had
him ranked among the First Friends.

1 Ma 1 1 :28 Jonathan asked the king to exempt Judaea and the three Samaritan districts from taxation,
promising him three hundred talants in return.

1 Ma 1 1 :29 The king consented, and wrote Jonathan a rescript covering the whole matter, in these terms:

1 Ma 1 1 :30 “King Demetrius to Jonathan his brother, and to the Jewish nation, greetings.

1 Ma 1 1 :31 “We have written to Lasthenes our cousin concerning you, and now send you this copy of our
rescript for your own information:

1 Ma 1 1 :32 ‘King Demetrius to his father Lasthenes, greetings.

1 Ma 1 1 :33 ‘The nation of the Jews is our ally; they fulfil their obligations to us, and in view of their goodwill
towards us we have decided to show them our bounty.

1 Ma 1 1 :34 We confirm them in their possession of the territory of Judaea and the three districts of Aphairema,
Lydda and Ramathaim; these were annexed to Judaea from Samaritan territory, with all their dependencies, in
favour of all who offer sacrifice in Jerusalem, instead of the royal dues which the king formerly received from
them every year, from the yield of the soil and the fruit crops.

1 Ma 1 1 :35 As regards our other rights over the tithes and taxes due to us, over the salt marshes, and the crown
taxes due to us, as from today we release them from them all.

1 Ma 1 1 :36 None of these grants will be revoked henceforth or anywhere.

1 Ma 1 1 :37 You will make yourself responsible for having a copy of this made, to be given to Jonathan and
displayed on the holy mountain in a conspicuous place’”.

1 Ma 1 1 :38 When King Demetrius saw that the country was at peace under his rule and that no resistance was
offered him, he dismissed his forces, and sent all the men home, except for the foreign troops that he had
recruited in the foreign island, thus incurring the enmity of the veterans who had served his ancestors.

IMa 1 1 :39 Now Trypho, one of Alexander’s former supporters, noting that all the troops were muttering against
Demetrius, went to see lamleku, the Arab who was bringing up Antiochus, Alexander’s young son,

1 Ma 1 1 :40 and repeatedly urged him to let him have the boy, so that he might succeed his father as king; he
told him of Demetrius’ decision and of the resentment it had aroused among his troops. He spent a long time
there.

1 Ma 1 1 :41 Jonathan, meanwhile, sent to ask King Demetrius to withdraw the garrisons from the Citadel in
Jerusalem and from the other fortresses, since they were constantly fighting Israel.

1 Ma 1 1 :42 Demetrius sent word back to Jonathan, “Not only will I do this for you and for your nation, but I shall
heap honours on you and your nation if I find a favourable opportunity.

1 Ma 1 1 :43 For the present, you would do well to send me reinforcements, since all my troops have deserted”.

1 Ma 1 1 :44 Jonathan sent three thousand experienced soldiers to him in Antioch; when they reached the king,
he was delighted at their arrival.

1 Ma 1 1 :45 The citizens crowded together in the centre of the city, to the number of some hundred and twenty
thousand, intending to kill the king.

1 Ma 1 1 :46 The king took refuge in the palace, while the citizens occupied the thoroughfares of the city and
began to attack.

1 Ma 1 1 :47 The king then called on the Jews for help; and these all rallied round him, then fanned out through



the city, and that day killed about a hundred thousand of its inhabitants.

1 Ma 1 1 :48 They fired the city, seizing a great deal of plunder at the same time, and secured the king’s safety.

1 Ma 1 1 :49 When the citizens saw that the Jews had the city at their mercy, their courage failed them, and they
made an abject appeal to the king,

1 Ma 1 1 :50 “Give us the right hand of peace, and let the Jews stop their fight against us and the city”.

1 Ma 1 1 :51 They threw down their arms and made peace. The Jews were covered in glory, in the eyes of the
king and of everyone else in his kingdom. Having won renown in his kingdom, they returned to Jerusalem laden
with booty.

1 Ma 1 1 :52 Thus, King Demetrius sat all the more securely on his royal throne, and the country was quiet under
his government.

1 Ma 1 1 :53 But he gave the lie to all the promises he had made, and changed his attitude to Jonathan, giving
nothing in return for the services Jonathan had rendered him, but thwarting him at every turn.

IMa 11:54 After this, Trypho came back with the little boy Antiochus, who became king and was crowned.

1 Ma 1 1 :55 All the troops that Demetrius had summarily dismissed rallied to Antiochus, and made war on
Demetrius, who turned tail and fled.

1 Ma 1 1 :56 Trypho captured the elephants and seized Antioch.

1 Ma 1 1 :57 Young Antiochus then wrote as follows to Jonathan: “I confirm you in the high-priesthood and set you
over the four districts and appoint you one of the Friends of the King”.

1 Ma 1 1 :58 He sent him a service of gold plate, and granted him the right to drink from gold vessels, and to wear
the purple and the golden brooch.

1 Ma 1 1 :59 He appointed his brother Simon commander-in-chief of the region from the Ladder of Tyre to the
frontiers of Egypt.

1 Ma 1 1 :60 Jonathan then set out and made a progress through Transeuphrates and its towns, and the entire
Syrian army rallied to his support. He came to Ascalon and was received in state by the inhabitants.

1 Ma 1 1 :61 From there he proceeded to Gaza, but the people of Gaza shut him out, so he laid siege to it,
burning down its suburbs and plundering them.

1 Ma 1 1 :62 The people of Gaza then pleaded with Jonathan, and he made peace with them; but he took the
sons of their chief men as hostages and sent them away to Jerusalem. He then travelled through the country as
far as Damascus.

1 Ma 1 1 :63 Jonathan now learned that Demetrius’ generals had arrived at Kadesh in Galilee with a large army,
intending to remove him from office,

1 Ma 1 1 :64 and went to engage them, leaving his brother Simon inside the country.

1 Ma 1 1 :65 Simon laid siege to Beth-Zur, attacking it day after day, and blockading the inhabitants
1 Ma 1 1 :66 till they sued for peace, which he granted them, though he expelled them from the town and
occupied it, stationing a garrison there.

1 Ma 1 1 :67 Jonathan and his army, meanwhile, having pitched camp by the Lake of Gennesar, rose early, and
by morning were already in the plain of Hazor.

1 Ma 1 1 :68 The foreigners’ army advanced to fight them on the plain, having first positioned an ambush for him
in the mountains. While the main body was advancing directly towards the Jews,

1 Ma 1 1 :69 the troops in ambush broke cover and attacked first.

1 Ma 1 1 :70 All the men with Jonathan fled; no one was left, except Mattathias son of Absalom and Judas son of
Chalphi, the generals of his army.

IMa 1 1:71 At this, Jonathan tore his garments, put dust on his head, and prayed.

1 Ma 1 1 :72 Then he returned to the fight and routed the enemy, who fled.

1 Ma 1 1 :73 When the fugitives from his own forces saw this, they came back to him and joined in the pursuit as
far as Kadesh where the enemy encampment was, and there they themselves pitched camp.

1 Ma 1 1 :74 About three thousand of the foreign troops fell that day. Jonathan then returned to Jerusalem.

IMa 12:1 When Jonathan saw that circumstances were working in his favour, he sent a select mission to Rome
to confirm and renew his treaty of friendship with the Romans.

IMa 12:2 He also sent letters to the same effect to the Spartans and to other places.

IMa 12:3 The envoys made their way to Rome, entered the Senate and said, “Jonathan the high priest and the
Jewish nation have sent us to renew your treaty of friendship and alliance with them as before”.

IMa 12:4 The Senate gave them letters to the authorities of each place, to procure their safe conduct to
Judaea.

IMa 12:5 The following is the copy of the letter Jonathan wrote to the Spartans:

IMa 12:6 “Jonathan the high priest, the senate of the nation, the priests and the rest of the Jewish people to the
Spartans their brothers, greetings.

1 Ma 1 2:7 “In the past, a letter was sent to Onias, the high priest, from Areios, one of your kings, stating that you
are indeed our brothers, as the copy subjoined attests.



IMa 12:8 Onias received the envoy with honour, and accepted the letter, in which a clear declaration was made
of friendship and alliance.

IMa 12:9 For our part, though we have no need of these, having the consolation of the holy books in our
possession,

IMa 12:10 we venture to send to renew ourfraternal friendship with you, so that we may not become strangers
to you, a long time having elapsed since you last wrote to us.

IMa 12:11 We, for our part, on every occasion, at our festivals and on other appointed days, unfailingly
remember you in the sacrifices we offer and in our prayers, as it is right and fitting to remember brothers.

IMa 12:12 We rejoice in your renown.

IMa 12:13 “We ourselves, however, have had many trials and many wars, the neighbouring kings making war
on us.

IMa 12:14 We were unwilling to trouble you or our other allies and friends during these wars,

IMa 12:15 since we have the support of Heaven to help us, thanks to which we have been delivered from our
enemies, and they are the ones who have been brought low.

IMa 12:16 We have therefore chosen Numenius son of Antiochus, and Antipater son of Jason, and sent them
to the Romans to renew our former treaty of friendship and alliance,

IMa 12:17 and we have ordered them also to visit you, to greet you and deliver you this letter of ours
concerning the renewal of our brotherhood;

IMa 12:18 we shall be grateful for an answer to it”.

IMa 12:19 The following is the copy of the letter sent to Onias:

IMa 12:20 “Areios king of the Spartans, to Onias the high priest, greetings.

IMa 12:21 “It has been discovered in records regarding the Spartans and Jews that they are brothers, and of
the race of Abraham.

1 Ma 1 2:22 Now that this has come to our knowledge, we shall be obliged if you will send us news of your
welfare.

IMa 12:23 Our own message to you is this: your flocks and your possessions are ours, and ours are yours, and
we are instructing our envoys to give you a message to this effect”.

IMa 12:24 Jonathan learned that Demetrius’ generals had returned with a larger army than before to make war
on him.

IMa 12:25 He therefore left Jerusalem and went to engage them in the area of Hamath, not giving them the
time to invade his own territory.

1 Ma 12:26 He sent spies into their camp, who told him on their return that the enemy were taking up positions
for a night attack on the Jews.

1 Ma 12:27 At sunset, Jonathan ordered his men to keep watch with their weapons at hand, in readiness to fight
at any time during the night, and posted advance guards all round the camp.

IMa 12:28 On learning that Jonathan and his men were ready to fight, the enemy took fright and, with quaking
hearts, lit fires in their bivouac and decamped.

IMa 12:29 Jonathan and his men, watching the glow of the fires, were unaware of their withdrawal until
morning,

IMa 12:30 and although Jonathan pursued them, he failed to overtake them, for they had already crossed the
river Eleutherus.

IMa 12:31 So Jonathan wheeled round on the Arabs called Zabadaeans, beat them and plundered them;

IMa 12:32 then, breaking camp, he went to Damascus, thus crossing the whole province.

IMa 12:33 Simon, meanwhile, had also set out and had penetrated as far as Ascalon and the neighbouring
towns. He then turned on Joppa and moved quickly to occupy it,

IMa 1 2:34 for he had heard of their intention to hand over this strong point to the supporters of Demetrius; he
stationed a garrison there to hold it.

IMa 12:35 Jonathan, on his return, called a meeting of the elders of the people and decided with them to build
fortresses in Judaea

IMa 12:36 and to heighten the walls of Jerusalem and erect a high barrier between the Citadel and the city, to
cut the former off from the city and isolate it, to prevent the occupants from buying or selling.

IMa 12:37 Rebuilding the city was a co-operative effort: part of the wall over the eastern ravine had fallen down;
he restored the quarter called Chaphenatha.

IMa 12:38 Simon, meanwhile, rebuilt Adida in the lowlands, fortifying it, and erecting gates with bolts.

IMa 12:39 Trypho’s ambition was to become king of Asia, assume the crown, and overpower King Antiochus.

1 Ma 1 2:40 He was apprehensive that Jonathan might not allow him to do this, and might even make war on
him, so he set out and came to Beth-Shean, in the hopes of finding some pretext for having him arrested and put
to death.

IMa 12:41 Jonathan went out to intercept him, with forty thousand picked men in battle order, and arrived at



Beth-Shean.

IMa 12:42 When Trypho saw him there with a large force, he hesitated to make any move against him.

IMa 12:43 He even received him with honour, commended him to all his friends, gave him presents and
ordered his friends and his troops to obey him as they would himself.

IMa 12:44 He said to Jonathan, “Why have you given all these people so much trouble, when there is no threat
of war between us?

1 Ma 1 2:45 Send them back home; pick yourself a few men as your bodyguard, and come with me to Ptolemais,
which I am going to hand over to you, with the other fortresses and the remaining troops and all the officials;
after which, I shall take the road for home. This was my purpose in coming here”.

IMa 12:46 Jonathan trusted him and did as he said; he dismissed his forces, who went back to Judaea.

IMa 12:47 With him he retained three thousand men, of whom he left two thousand in Galilee, while a thousand
accompanied him.

IMa 12:48 But as soon as Jonathan had entered Ptolemais, the people of Ptolemais closed the gates, seized
him, and put all those who had entered with him to the sword.

IMa 12:49 Trypho sent troops and cavalry into Galilee and the Great Plain to destroy all Jonathan’s supporters.
IMa 12:50 These, concluding that he had been taken and had perished with his companions, encouraged one
another, marching with closed ranks and ready to give battle,

IMa 12:51 and when their pursuers saw that they would fight for their lives, they turned back.

IMa 12:52 All reached Judaea safe and sound, and there they lamented Jonathan and his companions, being
very frightened indeed; all Israel was plunged into mourning.

IMa 12:53 The surrounding nations were all now looking for ways of destroying them: “They have no leader”,
they said, “no ally; we have only to attack them now, and we shall blot out their very memory from all peoples”.
IMa 13:1 Simon heard that Trypho had collected a large army to invade and devastate Judaea,

1 Ma 1 3:2 and when he saw how the people were quaking with fear, he went up to Jerusalem, called the people

together,

1 Ma 1 3:3 and exhorted them thus, “You know yourselves how much I and my brothers and my father’s family
have done for the laws and the sanctuary; you know what wars and hardships we have experienced.

IMa 13:4 That is why my brothers are all dead, for Israel’s sake, and I am the only one left.

1 Ma 1 3:5 Far be it from me, then, to be sparing of my own life in any time of oppression, for I am not worth more

than my brothers.

1 Ma 1 3:6 Rather will I avenge my nation and the sanctuary and your wives and children, now that the foreigners
are all united in malice to destroy us”.

1 Ma 1 3:7 The people’s spirit rekindled as they listened to his words,

1 Ma 1 3:8 and they shouted back at him, “You are our leader in place of Judas and your brother Jonathan.

1 Ma 1 3:9 Fight our battles for us, and we will do whatever you tell us”.

IMa 13:10 So he assembled all the fighting men and hurried on with completing the walls of Jerusalem,
fortifying the whole perimeter.

IMa 13:1 1 He sent a considerable force to Joppa under Jonathan son of Absalom who drove out the inhabitants
and remained there in occupation.

IMa 13:12 Trypho now left Ptolemais with a large army to invade Judaea, taking Jonathan with him under
guard.

IMa 13:13 Simon pitched camp in Adida, facing the plain.

IMa 13:14 When Trypho learned that Simon had taken the place of his brother Jonathan and that he intended
to join battle with him, he sent envoys to him with this message,

IMa 13:15 “Your brother Jonathan was in debt to the royal exchequer for the offices he held; that is why we are
detaining him.

IMa 13:16 If you send a hundred talants of silver and two of his sons as hostages, to make sure that on his
release he does not revolt against us, we shall release him”.

IMa 13:17 Although Simon was aware that the message was a ruse, he sent for the money and the boys for
fear of incurring great hostility from the people,

IMa 13:18 who would have said that Jonathan had died because Simon would not send Trypho the money and
the children.

IMa 13:19 He therefore sent both the boys and the hundred talants, but Trypho broke his word and did not
release Jonathan.

1 Ma 1 3:20 Next, T rypho set about the invasion and devastation of the country; he made a detour along the
Adora road, but Simon and his army confronted him wherever he attempted to go.

IMa 13:21 The men in the Citadel kept sending messengers to Trypho, urging him to get through to them by
way of the desert and send them supplies.

IMa 13:22 Trypho organised his entire cavalry to go, but that night it snowed so heavily that he could not get



through for the snow, so he left there and moved off into Gilead.

IMa 13:23 As he approached Baskama he killed Jonathan, who was buried there.

IMa 13:24 Trypho turned back and regained his own country.

1 Ma 1 3:25 Simon sent and recovered the bones of his brother Jonathan, and buried him in Modein, the town of
his ancestors.

IMa 13:26 All Israel kept solemn mourning for him and long bewailed him.

1 Ma 1 3:27 Over the tomb of his father and brothers, Simon raised a monument high enough to catch the eye,
using dressed stone back and front.

IMa 13:28 He erected seven pyramids facing each other, for his father and mother and his four brothers,

IMa 13:29 surrounding them with a structure consisting of tall columns surmounted by trophies of arms to their
everlasting memory and, beside the trophies of arms, ships sculpted on a scale to be seen by all who sail the
sea.

IMa 13:30 Such was the monument he constructed at Modein, and it is still there today.

IMa 13:31 Now Trypho, betraying the trust of young King Antiochus, put him to death.

1 Ma 1 3:32 He usurped his throne, assuming the crown of Asia, and brought great havoc on the country.

1 Ma 1 3:33 Simon built up the fortresses of Judaea, surrounding them with high towers, great walls and gates
with bolts, and stocked these fortresses with food.

1 Ma 1 3:34 He also sent a delegation to King Demetrius, to get him to grant the province a remission, since all
Trypho did was to despoil.

IMa 13:35 King Demetrius replied to his request in a letter framed as follows:

1 Ma 1 3:36 “King Demetrius to Simon, high priest and Friend of Kings, and to the elders and nation of the Jews,
greetings.

IMa 13:37 “It has pleased us to accept the golden crown and the palm you have sent us, and we are disposed
to make a general peace with you, and to write to the officials to grant you remissions.

IMa 13:38 Everything that we have decreed concerning you remains in force, and the fortresses you have built
may remain in your hands.

IMa 13:39 We pardon all offences, unwitting or intentional, hitherto committed, and remit the crown tax you now
owe us; and whatever other taxes were levied in Jerusalem are no longer to be levied.

1 Ma 1 3:40 If any of you are suitable for enrolment in our bodyguard, let them be enrolled, and let there be
peace between us”.

IMa 13:41 The gentile yoke was thus lifted from Israel in the year 170,

1 Ma 1 3:42 when our people began engrossing their documents and contracts: “In the first year of Simon,
eminent high priest, commander-in-chief and ethnarch of the Jews”.

1 Ma 1 3:43 About that time Simon laid siege to Gezer, surrounding it with his troops. He constructed a mobile
tower, brought it up to the city, opened a breach in one of the bastions and took it.

IMa 13:44 The men in the mobile tower sprang out into the city, where great confusion ensued.

1 Ma 1 3:45 The citizens, accompanied by their wives and children, mounted the ramparts with their garments
torn and loudly implored Simon to make peace with them:

IMa 13:46 “Treat us”, they said, “not as our wickedness deserves, but as your mercy prompts you”.

IMa 13:47 Simon came to terms with them and stopped the fighting; but he expelled them from the city, purified
the houses which contained idols, and then made his entry with songs of praise.

IMa 13:48 He banished all impurity from it, settled in it people who observed the Law, and having fortified it,
built a residence there for himself.

IMa 13:49 The occupants of the Citadel in Jerusalem, prevented as they were from coming out and going into
the countryside to buy and sell, were in desperate need of food, and numbers of them were being carried off by
starvation.

IMa 13:50 They begged Simon to make peace with them, and he granted this, though he expelled them and
purified the Citadel from its pollutions.

IMa 13:51 The Jews made their entry on the twenty-third day of the second month in the year 171, with
acclamations and carrying palms, to the sound of lyres, cymbals and harps, chanting hymns and canticles, since
a great enemy had been crushed and thrown out of Israel. Simon made it a day of annual rejoicing.

IMa 13:52 He fortified the Temple hill on the Citadel side, and took up residence there with his men.

IMa 13:53 Since his son John had come to manhood, Simon appointed him general-in-chief, with his residence
in Gezer.

IMa 14:1 In the year 172, King Demetrius assembled his forces and marched into Media to raise help for the
fight against Trypho.

IMa 14:2 When Arsaces king of Persia and Media heard that Demetrius had entered his territory, he sent one of
his generals to capture him alive.

IMa 14:3 The general defeated the army of Demetrius, seized him and brought him to Arsaces, who imprisoned



him.

IMa 14:4 The country was at peace throughout the days of Simon. He sought the good of his nation and they
were well pleased with his authority, as with his magnificence, throughout his life.

IMa 14:5 To crown his titles to glory, he took Joppa and made it a harbour, gaining access to the Mediterranean
Isles.

IMa 14:6 He enlarged the frontiers of his nation, keeping his mastery over the homeland,

IMa 14:7 resettling a host of captives. He conquered Gezer, Beth-Zur and the Citadel, ridding them of every
impurity, and no one could resist him.

IMa 14:8 The people farmed their land in peace; the land gave its produce, the trees of the plain their fruit.

IMa 14:9 The elders sat at ease in the squares, all their talk was of their prosperity; the young men wore
splendid armour.

IMa 14:10 He kept the towns supplied with provisions and furnished with fortifications, until his fame resounded
to the ends of the earth.

IMa 14:1 1 He established peace in the land, and Israel knew great joy.

IMa 14:12 Each man sat under his own vine and his own fig tree, and there was no one to make them afraid.
IMa 14:13 No enemy was left in the land to fight them, the very kings of those times had been crushed.

IMa 14:14 He encouraged the afflicted members of his people, suppressing every wicked man and renegade.
He strove to observe the Law,

IMa 14:15 and gave new splendour to the Temple, enriching it with many sacred vessels.

IMa 14:16 When it became known in Rome and as far as Sparta that Jonathan was dead, people were deeply
grieved.

IMa 14:17 But as soon as they heard that his brother Simon had succeeded him as high priest and was master
of the country and the cities in it,

IMa 14:18 they wrote to him on bronze tablets to renew the treaty of friendship and alliance which they had
made with his brothers, Judas and Jonathan,

IMa 14:19 and the document was read out before the assembly in Jerusalem.

1 Ma 14:20 This is the copy of the letter sent by the Spartans: “The rulers and the city of Sparta, to Simon the
high priest and to the elders and priests and the rest of the people of the Jews, greetings.

IMa 14:21 “The ambassadors whom you sent to our people have informed us of your glory and prosperity, and
we are delighted with their visit.

IMa 14:22 We have recorded their declarations in the minutes of our public assemblies, as follows, ‘Numenius
son of Antiochus, and Antipater son of Jason, ambassadors of the Jews, came to us to renew their friendship
with us.

1 Ma 14:23 And it was the people’s pleasure to receive these personages with honour and to deposit a copy of
their statements in the public archives, so that the people of Sparta might preserve a record of them. A copy was
also made for Simon the high priest’”.

IMa 14:24 After this, Simon sent Numenius to Rome as the bearer of a large golden shield weighing a thousand
mina, to confirm the alliance with them.

IMa 14:25 When these events were reported to our people, they said, “What mark of appreciation shall we give
to Simon and his sons?

IMa 14:26 He stood firm, he and his brothers and his father’s house: he fought off the enemies of Israel and
secured its freedom”. So they recorded an inscription on bronze tablets and set it up on pillars on Mount Zion.

1 Ma 14:27 This is a copy of the text: “The eighteenth of Elul, in the year 1 72, being the third year of Simon,
eminent high priest:

IMa 14:28 “In Asaramel, in the Grand Assembly of priests and people, of princes of the nation and of elders of
the country: “We are acquainted with the matters following:

IMa 14:29 “When there was almost incessant fighting in the country Simon, son of Mattathias, a priest of the
line of Joarib, and his brothers courted danger and withstood their nation’s enemies to safeguard the integrity of
their sanctuary and of the Law, and so brought their nation great glory;

IMa 14:30 “For when, Jonathan having rallied his nation and become its high priest and having then been
gathered to his ancestors,

IMa 14:31 the enemy planned to invade the country, intending to devastate their territory and to lay hands on
their sanctuary,

IMa 14:32 Simon next came forward to fight for his nation: spending much of his personal wealth on arming his
nation’s fighting men and on providing their pay;

1 Ma 14:33 fortifying the towns of Judaea, as well as Beth-Zur on the Judaean frontier where the enemy arsenal
had formerly been, and stationing in it a garrison of Jewish soldiers;

1 Ma 14:34 fortifying Joppa on the coast, and Gezer on the borders of Azotus, a place formerly inhabited by the
enemy, founding a Jewish colony there, and providing the settlers with everything they needed to set them on



their feet;

IMa 14:35 “In consequence of which, the people, aware of Simon’s loyalty and of the glory which he was
determined to win for his nation, have made him their ethnarch and high priest, for all his services and for the
integrity and loyalty which he has shown towards his nation, and for having by every means sought to enhance
his people’s power;

1 Ma 1 4:36 “It has fallen to him in his time to expel the foreigners from his country, including those in the City of
David in Jerusalem, who had converted it into a citadel for their own use, from which they would sally out to
defile the surroundings of the sanctuary and to violate its sacred character;

IMa 14:37 to station Jewish soldiers there instead for the security of the country and the city; and to heighten
the walls of Jerusalem;

IMa 1 4:38 “And since King Demetrius has heard that the Romans call the Jews their friends, allies and brothers,
IMa 14:39 and that they have given an honourable reception to Simon’s ambassadors, and, furthermore,

1 Ma 14:40 that the Jews and priests are happy that Simon should, pending the advent of a genuine prophet, be
their ethnarch and high priest for life

IMa 14:41 therefore he has confirmed him in the high-priestly office, has raised him to the rank of Friend and
has showered great honours on him, also confirming him as their commander-in-chief,

1 Ma 1 4:42 with the right to appoint officials to oversee the fabric of the sanctuary and to administer the country,
munitions and fortresses;

IMa 14:43 he is to have personal charge of the sanctuary, and to be obeyed by all; all official documents in the
country must be drawn up in his name; and he may assume the purple and may wear golden ornaments;

1 Ma 1 4:44 “Furthermore, it is against the law for any member of the public or of the priesthood to contravene
any of these enactments or to contest his decisions, or to convene a meeting anywhere in the country without his
permission, or to assume the purple or wear the golden brooch;

IMa 14:45 and anyone acting contrary to, or rejecting any article of, these enactments is liable to punishment;
IMa 14:46 “And since the people have unanimously agreed to grant Simon the right to act as aforesaid, and
IMa 14:47 since Simon, for his part, has given his assent, and has consented to assume the high-priestly office
and to be commander-in-chief and ethnarch of the Jews and their priests, and to preside over all:

IMa 14:48 “So, be it now enacted: that this record be inscribed on bronze tablets and be erected at some
conspicuous place within the precincts of the Temple,

1 Ma 1 4:49 and that copies be deposited in the T reasury for Simon and his descendants”.

IMa 15:1 Antiochus son of King Demetrius addressed a letter from the Mediterranean Isles to Simon, priest and
ethnarch of the Jews, and to the whole nation;

IMa 15:2 this was how it read: “King Antiochus to Simon, high priest and ethnarch, and to the Jewish nation,
greetings.

IMa 15:3 “Whereas certain scoundrels have seized control of the kingdom of our fathers, and I propose to claim
back the kingdom so that I may re-establish it as it was before, and whereäs I have accordingly recruited very
large forces and fitted out warships,

IMa 15:4 intending to make a landing in the country and to hunt down the men who have ruined it and laid
waste many towns in my kingdom;

1 Ma 1 5:5 “I now, therefore, confirm in your favour all remissions of taxes granted to you by the kings my
predecessors, as well as the waiving of whatever presents they may have conceded.

1 Ma 1 5:6 I hereby authorise you to mint your own coinage as legal tender for your own country.

IMa 15:7 I declare Jerusalem and the sanctuary to be free; all the arms you have manufactured and the
fortresses you have built and now occupy may remain yours.

IMa 15:8 All debts to the royal treasury, present or future, are cancelled henceforth in perpetuity.

IMa 15:9 Furthermore, when we have won back our kingdom, we shall bestow such great honour on yourself,
your nation and the sanctuary as will make your glory known throughout the world”.

IMa 15:10 Antiochus invaded the land of his ancestors in the year 174 and, since the troops all rallied to him,
Trypho was left with few supporters.

IMa 15:1 1 Antiochus pursued the usurper, who took refuge in Dora on the coast,

IMa 15:12 knowing that misfortunes were piling up on him and that his troops had deserted him.

IMa 15:13 Antiochus pitched camp outside Dora with a hundred and twenty thousand fighting men and eight
thousand cavalry.

IMa 15:14 He laid siege to the city while the ships closed in from the sea, so that he had the city under attack
from land and sea, and allowed no one to go in or come out.

IMa 15:15 Numenius and his companions, meanwhile, arrived from Rome, bringing letters addressed to various
kings and states, in the following terms:

IMa 15:16 “Lucius, consul of the Romans, to King Ptolemy, greetings.

IMa 15:17 “The Jewish ambassadors have come to us as our friends and allies to renew our original friendship



and alliance in the name of the high priest Simon and the Jewish people.

IMa 15:18 They have brought a golden shield worth a thousand mina.

IMa 15:19 Accordingly, we have seen fit to write to various kings and states, warning them neither to molest the
Jewish people nor to attack either them or their towns or their country, nor to ally themselves with any such
aggressors.

1 Ma 1 5:20 We have seen fit to accept the shield from them.

IMa 15:21 If, therefore, any scoundrels have fled their country to take refuge with you, hand them over to Simon
the high priest, to be punished by him according to their law”.

IMa 15:22 The consul sent the same letter to King Demetrius, to Attalus, Ariarathes and Arsaces,

IMa 15:23 and to all states, including Sampsames, the Spartans, Delos, Myndos, Sicyon, Caria, Samos,
Pamphylia, Lycia, Halicarnassus, Rhodes, Phaselis, Cos, Side, Arados, Gortyn, Cyprus and Cyrene.

1 Ma 1 5:24 They also drew up a copy for Simon the high priest.

1 Ma 15:25 Antiochus, meanwhile, from his positions on the outskirts of Dora, was continually throwing
detachments against the town. He constructed siege-engines, and blockaded Trypho, preventing movement in
or out.

IMa 15:26 Simon sent him two thousand picked men to support him in the fight, with silver and gold and plenty
of equipment.

IMa 15:27 But Antiochus would not accept them; instead, he repudiated all his previous agreements with Simon
and completely changed his attitude to him.

1 Ma 1 5:28 He sent him Athenobius, one of his Friends, to confer with him and say, “You are now occupying
Joppa and Gezer and the Citadel in Jerusalem, which are towns in my kingdom.

1 Ma 1 5:29 You have laid waste their territory and done immense harm to the country; and you have seized
control of many places properly in my kingdom.

1 Ma 1 5:30 Either now surrender the towns you have taken and the taxes from the places you have seized
outside the frontiers of Judaea,

1 Ma 1 5:31 or else pay me five hundred talants of silver in compensation for them and for the destruction you
have done, and another five hundred talants for the taxes from the towns; otherwise we shall come and make
war on you”.

IMa 15:32 When the King’s Friend, Athenobius, reached Jerusalem and saw Simon’s magnificence, his cabinet
of gold and silver plate and the state he kept, he was dumbfounded. He delivered the king’s message,

IMa 15:33 but Simon gave him this answer, “We have not taken foreign territory or any alien property but have
occupied our ancestral heritage, for some time unjustly wrested from us by our enemies;

IMa 15:34 now that we have a favourable opportunity, we are merely recovering our ancestral heritage.

IMa 15:35 As regards Joppa and Gezer, which you claim, these were towns that did great harm to our people
and laid waste our country; we are prepared to give a hundred talants for them”. Without so much as a word in
answer,

IMa 15:36 the envoy went back to the king in a rage and reported on Simon’s answer and his magnificence,
and on everything he had seen, at which the king fell into a fury.

IMa 15:37 Trypho now boarded a ship and escaped to Orthosia.

1 Ma 1 5:38 The king appointed Cendebaeus military governor of the coastal region and allotted him a force of
infantry and cavalry.

IMa 15:39 He ordered him to deploy his men facing Judaea, and instructed him to rebuild Kedron and fortify its
gates, and to make war on our people, while the king himself went in pursuit of T rypho.

IMa 15:40 Cendebaeus arrived at Jamnia and began to provoke our people forthwith, invading Judaea, taking
prisoners, and massacring.

IMa 15:41 Having rebuilt Kedron, he stationed cavalry and troops there to make sorties and patrol the roads of
Judaea, as the king had ordered.

IMa 16:1 John then went up from Gezer and reported to his father Simon what Cendebaeus was busy doing.
IMa 16:2 At this, Simon summoned his two elder sons, Judas and John, and said to them, “My brothers and I,
and my father’s House, have fought the enemies of Israel from our youth until today, and many a time we have
been successful in rescuing Israel.

IMa 16:3 But now I am an old man, while you, by the mercy of Heaven, are the right age; take the place of my
brother and myself, go out and fight for our nation, and may Heaven’s aid be with you”.

IMa 16:4 He then selected twenty thousand of the country’s fighting men and cavalry, and these marched
against Cendebaeus, spending the night at Modein.

IMa 16:5 Making an early start, they marched into the plain, to find a large army opposing them, both infantry
and cavalry; there was, however, a stream-bed in between.

IMa 16:6 John drew up facing them, he and his army and, seeing that the men were afraid to cross the stream-
bed, crossed over first himself. When his men saw this, they too crossed after him.



1 Ma 1 6:7 He divided his army into two, with the cavalry in the centre and the infantry on either flank, as the
opposing cavalry was very numerous.

1 Ma 1 6:8 The trumpets rang out; Cendebaeus and his army were put to flight, many of them falling mortally
wounded and the rest of them fleeing to the fortress.

1 Ma 1 6:9 Then it was that Judas, John’s brother, was wounded, but John pursued them until Cendebaeus
reached Kedron, which he had rebuilt.

IMa 16:10 Their flight took them as far as the towers in the countryside of Azotus, and John burnt these down.
The enemy losses amounted to ten thousand men; John returned safely to Judaea.

IMa 16:1 1 Ptolemy son of Abubos had been appointed general in command of the Plain of Jericho; he owned a
great deal of silver and gold,

IMa 16:12 and was the high priest’s son-in-law.

IMa 16:13 His ambition was fired; he hoped to make himself master of the whole country and therefore
treacherously began to plot the destruction of Simon and his sons.

IMa 16:14 Simon, who was inspecting the towns up and down the country and attending to their administration,
had come down to Jericho with his sons Mattathias and Judas, in the year 172, in the eleventh month, the month
of Shebat.

IMa 16:15 The son of Abubos lured them into a small fortress called Dok, which he had built, where he offered
them a great banquet, having previously hidden men in the place.

IMa 16:16 When Simon and his sons were drunk, Ptolemy and his men reached for their weapons, rushed on
Simon in the banqueting hall and killed him with his two sons and some of his servants.

IMa 16:17 He thus committed a great act of treachery and rendered evil for good.

IMa 16:18 Ptolemy wrote a report of the affair and sent it to the king, in the expectation of being sent
reinforcements and of having the cities and the province made over to him.

IMa 16:19 He also sent people to Gezerto murder John, and sent written orders to the military commanders to
come to him so that he could give them silver, gold and presents;

IMa 16:20 and he also sent others to seize control of Jerusalem and the Temple mount.

IMa 16:21 But someöne had been too quick for him and had already informed John in Gezer that his father and
brothers had perished, adding, “He is sending someöne to kill you too!”.

IMa 16:22 Overcome as John was by the news, he arrested the men who had come to kill him and put them to
death, being forewarned of their murderous design.

IMa 16:23 The rest of John’s acts, the battles he fought and the exploits he performed, the city walls he built,
and all his other achievements,

IMa 16:24 from the day he succeeded his father as high priest, are recorded in the annals of his pontificate.
2Ma 1:1 “To their brothers, the Jews living in Egypt, from their brothers, the Jews in Jerusalem and Judaea,
greetings and untroubled peace.

2Ma 1 :2 “May God prosper you, remembering his covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, his faithful
servants.

2Ma 1 :3 May he give you all a heart to worship him and to do his will with a generous mind and a willing spirit.
2Ma 1:4 May he open your hearts to his Law and his precepts, and give you peace.

2Ma 1 :5 May he hear your prayers and be reconciled with you, and not abandon you in time of evil.

2Ma 1:6 Such is our prayer for you.

2Ma 1:7 “During the reign of Demetrius, in the year 169, we Jews wrote to you as follows, ‘In the extremity of
trouble that befell us in the years after Jason and his associates had betrayed the Holy Land and the kingdom,

2Ma 1:8 burning down the Temple gateway and shedding innocent blood, we prayed to the Lord and were then

heard. And we then offered a sacrifice, with wheat-flour, we lit the lamps and we set out the loaves’.

2Ma 1 :9 “And we now recommend you too to keep the feast of Shelters in the month of Chislev, in the year one
hundred and eighty-eight”.

2Ma 1:10 “The people of Jerusalem and of Judaea, the senate and Judas, to Aristobulus, tutor to King Ptolemy
and one of the family of the anointed priests, and to the Jews in Egypt, greetings and good health.

2Ma 1:11 “Since we have been rescued by God from great danger, we give him great thanks for championing
our cause against the king,

2Ma 1:12 for he it was who carried off those who had taken up arms against the Holy City.

2Ma 1:13 For when their leader reached Persia with his seemingly irresistible army, he was cut to pieces in the
temple of Nanaea, as the result of a ruse employed by the priests who served that goddess.

2Ma 1:14 On the pretext of marrying Nanaea, Antiochus came to the place with his friends, intending to take its
many treasures as a dowry.

2Ma 1:15 The priests of Nanaea had put these on display, and he for his part had entered the temple precincts
with only a small retinue. As soon as Antiochus had gone inside the temple, the priests shut him in,

2Ma 1:16 opened a trap-door hidden in the ceiling and struck the leader down by hurling stones like



thunderbolts. They then cut him into pieces and threw his head to those who were waiting outside.

2Ma 1:17 Blessed in all things be our God, who has delivered the sacrilegious over to death!

2Ma 1:18 “As we shall be celebrating the purification of the Temple on the twenty-fifth of Chislev, we consider it
proper to notify you, so that you too may celebrate it, as you do the feast of Shelters and the fire that appeared
when Nehemiah, the builder of the Temple and the altar, offered sacrifice.

2Ma 1:19 For when our ancestors were being deported to Persia, the devout priests of the time took some of
the fire from the altar and hid it secretly in a hole like a dry well, where they concealed it in such a way that the
place was unknown to anyone.

2Ma 1 :20 When some years had elapsed, in God’s good time, Nehemiah, commissioned by the king of Persia,
sent the descendants of the priests who had hidden the fire to look for it. When they reported that in fact they
had found not fire but a thick liquid, Nehemiah ordered them to draw some out and bring it back.

2Ma 1 :21 When they had done this, Nehemiah ordered the priests to pour this liquid over the sacrificial
materials, that is, the wood and what lay on it.

2Ma 1:22 When this had been done, and when in due course the sun, which had previously been clouded over,
shone out, a great fire flared up, to the astonishment of all.

2Ma 1:23 While the sacrifice was being burned, the priests offered prayer, Jonathan intoning with all the priests,
and the rest responding with Nehemiah.

2Ma 1 :24 The prayer took this form, ‘Lord, Lord God, Creator of all things, awesome, strong, just, merciful, the
only king and benefactor,

2Ma 1 :25 the only provider, who alone are just, almighty and everlasting, the deliverer of Israel from every evil,
who made our fathers your chosen ones and sanctified them,

2Ma 1 :26 accept this sacrifice on behalf of all your people Israel, and protect your heritage and consecrate it.
2Ma 1 .21 Bring together those of us who are dispersed, set free those in slavery among the heathen, look
favourably on those held in contempt or abhorrence, and let the heathen know that you are our God.

2Ma 1 :28 Punish those who oppress us and affront us by their insolence,

2Ma 1 :29 and plant your people firmly in your Holy Place, as Moses promised’.

2Ma 1:30 “The priests then chanted hymns accompanied by the harp.

2Ma 1:31 When the sacrifice had been burnt, Nehemiah ordered the remaining liquid to be poured over large
stones,

2Ma 1 :32 and when this was done a flame flared up, to be absorbed in a corresponding blaze of light from the
altar.

2Ma 1:33 When the matter became known and the king of the Persians heard that, in the place where the exiled
priests had hidden the fire, a liquid had appeared, with which Nehemiah and his people had purified the
sacrificial offerings,

2Ma 1:34 the king, after verifying the facts, had the place enclosed and pronounced sacred.

2Ma 1:35 To the people on whom the king bestowed it, he granted a part of the considerable revenue he
derived from it.

2Ma 1:36 Nehemiah and his people termed this stuff ‘nephtar’, which means ‘purification’, but it is commonly
called ‘naphta’.

2Ma 2:1 “It is on record that the prophet Jeremiah ordered the deportees to take the fire, as we have described,
2Ma 2:2 and how, having given them the Law, the prophet warned the deportees never to forget the Lord’s
precepts, nor to let their thoughts be tempted by the sight of gold and silver statues or the finery adorning them.
2Ma 2:3 Among other similar admonitions, he urged them not to let the Law depart from their hearts.

2Ma 2:4 “The same document also describes how the prophet, warned by an oracle, gave orders for the tent
and the ark to go with him, when he set out for the mountain which Moses had climbed to survey God’s heritage.
2Ma 2:5 On his arrival, Jeremiah found a cave-dwelling, into which he put the tent, the ark and the altar of
incense, afterwards blocking up the entrance.

2Ma 2:6 Some of his companions went back later to mark out the path but were unable to find it.

2Ma 2:7 When Jeremiah learned this, he reproached them, ‘The place is to remain unknown’, he said, ‘until
God gathers his people together again and shows them his mercy.

2Ma 2:8 Then the Lord will bring these things once more to light, and the glory of the Lord will be seen, and so
will the cloud, as it was revealed in the time of Moses and when Solomon prayed that the holy place might be
gloriously hallowed’.

2Ma 2:9 “It was also recorded how Solomon in his wisdom offered the sacrifice of the dedication and completion
of the sanctuary.

2Ma 2:10 As Moses had prayed to the Lord and fire had come down from heaven and burned up the sacrifice,
so Solomon also prayed, and the fire from above consumed the burnt offerings.

2Ma 2:1 1 Moses had said, ‘Because the sacrifice for sin had not been eaten, it was burnt instead’.

2Ma 2:12 Solomon similarly observed the eight-day festival.



2Ma 2:13 “In addition to the above, it was also recorded, both in these writings and in the Memoirs of Nehemiah,
how Nehemiah founded a library and made a collection of the books dealing with the kings and the prophets, the
writings of David and the letters of the kings on the subject of offerings.

2Ma 2:14 Similarly, Judas made a complete collection of the books dispersed in the late war, and these we still
have.

2Ma 2:15 If you need any of them, send someöne to fetch them.

2Ma 2:16 “Since we are about to celebrate the purification, we now write, requesting you to observe the same
days.

2Ma 2:17 God, who has saved his whole people, conferring heritage, kingdom, priesthood and sanctification on
all of us,

2Ma 2:18 as he has promised in the Law, will surely, as our hope is in him, be swift to show us mercy and
gather us together from everywhere under heaven to the holy place, since he has rescued us from great evils
and has purified it”.

2Ma 2:19 The story of Judas Maccabaeus and his brothers, the purification of the great Temple, the dedication
of the altar,

2Ma 2:20 together with the wars against Antiochus Epiphanes and his son Eupator,

2Ma 2:21 and the celestial manifestations that came to hearten the brave champions of Judaism, so that, few
though they were, they pillaged the whole country, routed the barbarian hordes,

2Ma 2:22 recovered the sanctuary renowned the whole world over, liberated the city and re-established the laws
by then all but abolished, the Lord showing his favour by all his gracious help to them-

2Ma 2:23 all this, already related in five books by Jason of Cyrene, we shall attempt to condense into a single
work.

2Ma 2:24 Considering the spate of figures and the difficulty encountered, because of the mass of material, by
those who wish to immerse themselves in historical records,

2Ma 2:25 we have aimed at providing diversion for those who merely want something to read, a saving of labour
for those who enjoy committing things to memory, and profit for each and all.

2Ma 2:26 For us who have undertaken the drudgery of this abridgement, it has been no easy task but a matter
of sweat and midnight oil,

2Ma 2:27 comparable to the exacting task of someöne organising a banquet, whose aim is to satisfy a variety of
tastes. Nevertheless, for the sake of rendering a general service, we remain glad to endure this drudgery,

2Ma 2:28 leaving accuracy of detail to the historian, and concentrating our effort on tracing the outlines in this
condensed version.

2Ma 2:29 Just as the architect of a new house is responsible for the construction as a whole, while the man
undertaking the ceramic painting has to take into consideration only the decorative requirements, so, I think, it is
with us.

2Ma 2:30 To make the subject his own, to explore its by-ways, to be meticulous about details, is the business of
the original historian,

2Ma 2:31 but the person making the adaptation must be allowed to aim at conciseness of expression and to
forgo any exhaustive treatment of his subject.

2Ma 2:32 So now let us begin our narrative, without adding any more to what has been said above; there would
be no sense in expanding the preface to the history and curtailing the history itself.

2Ma 3:1 While the holy city was inhabited in all peace and the laws were observed as perfectly as possible,
owing to the piety of Onias the high priest and his hatred of wickedness,

2Ma 3:2 it came about that the kings themselves honoured the holy place and enhanced the glory of the Temple
with the most splendid offerings,

2Ma 3:3 even to the extent that Seleucus king of Asia defrayed from his own revenues all the expenses arising
out of the sacrificial liturgy.

2Ma 3:4 But a certain Simon, of the tribe of Bilgah, on being appointed administrator of the Temple, came into
conflict with the high priest over the regulation of the city markets.

2Ma 3:5 Unable to get the better of Onias, he went off to Apollonius, son of Thraseos, who was at that time
commander-in-chief of Coele-Syria and Phoenicia,

2Ma 3:6 and made out to him that the Treasury in Jerusalem was groaning with untold wealth, that the amount
contributed was incalculable and out of all proportion to expenditure on the sacrifice, but that it could all be
brought under the control of the king.

2Ma 3:7 Apollonius met the king and told him about the wealth that had been disclosed to him; whereüpon the
king selected Heliodorus, his chancellor, and sent him with instructions to effect the removal of the reported
wealth.

2Ma 3:8 Heliodorus lost no time in setting out, ostensibly to inspect the towns of Coele-Syria and Phoenicia, but
in fact to accomplish the king’s purpose.



2Ma 3:9 On his arrival in Jerusalem, and after a hospitable reception from the high priest and the city, he
announced what had been disclosed, thus revealing the reason for his presence, and asked if this was indeed
the true situation.

2Ma 3:10 The high priest explained that there were funds set aside for widows and orphans,

2Ma 3:11 with some belonging to Hyrcanus son of Tobias, a man occupying a very exalted position, and that
the whole sum, in contrast to what the evil Simon had alleged, amounted to four hundred talants of silver and
two hundred of gold.

2Ma 3:12 He also added that it was entirely out of the question that an injustice should be done to those who
had put their trust in the sanctity of the place and in the inviolable majesty of a Temple venerated throughout the
entire world.

2Ma 3:13 But Heliodorus, because of his instructions from the king, peremptorily insisted that the funds must be
confiscated for the royal exchequer.

2Ma 3:14 Fixing a day for the purpose, he went in to draw up an inventory of the funds. There was no little
consternation throughout the city;

2Ma 3:15 the priests in their sacred vestments prostrated themselves before the altar and prayed to Heaven, to
the Author of the law governing deposits, to preserve these funds intact for the depositors.

2Ma 3:16 The appearance of the high priest was enough to pierce the heart of the beholder, his expression and
his altered colour betraying the anguish of his soul;

2Ma 3:17 the man was so overwhelmed by fear and bodily trembling that those who saw him could not possibly
mistake the distress he was suffering.

2Ma 3:18 People rushed headlong from the houses, intent on making public supplication because of the
indignity threatening the holy place.

2Ma 3:19 Women thronged the streets swathed in sackcloth below their breasts; girls secluded indoors came
running, some to the doorways, some to the city walls, while others leaned out of the windows,

2Ma 3:20 all stretching out their hands to Heaven in entreaty.

2Ma 3:21 It was pitiful to see the people crowding together to prostrate themselves, and the foreboding of the
high priest in his deep anguish.

2Ma 3:22 While they were calling on the all-powerful Lord to preserve the deposits intact for the depositors, in
full security,

2Ma 3:23 Heliodorus set about his appointed task.

2Ma 3:24 He had already arrived with his bodyguard near the Treasury, when the Sovereign of spirits and of
every power caused so great an apparition that all who had dared to accompany Heliodorus were dumbfounded
at the power of God and reduced to abject terror.

2Ma 3:25 Before their eyes appeared a horse richly caparisoned and carrying a fearsome rider. Rearing
violently, it struck at Heliodorus with its forefeet. The rider was seen to be accoutred entirely in gold.

2Ma 3:26 Two other young men of outstanding strength and radiant beauty, magnificently apparelled, appeared
to him at the same time and, taking their stand on each side of him, flogged him unremittingly, inflicting stroke
after stroke.

2Ma 3:27 Suddenly Heliodorus fell to the ground, enveloped in thick darkness. His men came to his rescue and
placed him in a litter,

2Ma 3:28 this man who but a moment before had made his way into the Treasury, as we said above, with a
great retinue and his whole bodyguard; and as they carried him away, powerless to help himself, they openly
acknowledged the sovereign power of God.

2Ma 3:29 While Heliodorus lay prostrate under the divine visitation, speechless and bereft of all hope of
deliverance,

2Ma 3:30 the Jews blessed the Lord who had miraculously glorified his own holy place. And the Temple, which
a little while before had been filled with terror and commotion, now overflowed with joy and gladness at the
manifestation of the almighty Lord.

2Ma 3:31 Some of Heliodorus’ companions quickly begged Onias to entreat the Most High to grant the man his
life, lying as he did at the very point of death.

2Ma 3:32 The high priest, afraid that the king might suspect the Jews of some foul play concerning Heliodorus,
did indeed offer a sacrifice for the man’s recovery.

2Ma 3:33 And while the high priest was performing the rite of expiation, the same young men again appeared to
Heliodorus, wearing the same apparel and, standing beside him, said, “Be very grateful to Onias the high priest,
since it is for his sake that the Lord has granted you your life.

2Ma 3:34 As for you, who have been scourged by Heaven, you must proclaim to everyone the grandeur of
God’s power”. So saying, they vanished.

2Ma 3:35 Heliodorus offered sacrifice to the Lord and made most solemn vows to the preserver of his life, and
then took courteous leave of Onias and marched his forces back to the king.



2Ma 3:36 He openly testified to everyone about the works of the supreme God which he had seen with his own
eyes.

2Ma 3:37 When the king asked Heliodorus what sort of man would be the right person to send to Jerusalem on
a second occasion, he replied,

2Ma 3:38 “If you have some enemy or anyone disloyal to the state, send him there, and you will get him back
well flogged, if he survives at all, since some peculiarly divine power attaches to the holy place.

2Ma 3:39 He who has his dwelling in heaven watches over the place and defends it, and he strikes down and
destroys those who come to harm it”.

2Ma 3:40 This was the outcome of the affair of Heliodorus and the preservation of the Treasury.

2Ma 4:1 The Simon mentioned above as the informer against the funds and against his country began
slandering Onias, insinuating that the latter had been responsible for the assault on Heliodorus and himself had
contrived this misfortune.

2Ma 4:2 Simon now had the effrontery to name this benefactor of the city, this protector of his compatriots, this
zealot for the laws, as an enemy of the public good.

2Ma 4:3 This hostility reached such proportions that murders were actually committed by some of Simon’s
agents,

2Ma 4:4 and at this point Onias, recognising how mischievous this rivalry was, and aware that Apollonius son of
Menestheus, the general commanding Coele-Syria and Phoenicia, was encouraging Simon in his malice,

2Ma 4:5 went to see the king, not to play the accuser of his fellow-citizens, but having the public and private
welfare of the entire people at heart.

2Ma 4:6 He saw that, without some intervention by the king, an orderly administration would no longer be
possible, nor would Simon put a stop to his folly.

2Ma 4:7 When Seleucus had departed this life and Antiochus styled Epiphanes had succeeded to the kingdom,
Jason, brother of Onias, usurped the high priesthood:

2Ma 4:8 he approached the king with a promise of three hundred and sixty talants of silver, with eighty talants to
come from some other source of revenue.

2Ma 4:9 He further committed himself to paying another hundred and fifty, if the king would empower him to set
up a gymnasium and youth centre, and to register the Antiochists of Jerusalem.

2Ma 4:10 When the king gave his assent, Jason, as soon as he had seized power, imposed the Greek way of
life on his fellow-countrymen.

2Ma 4:1 1 He suppressed the liberties which the kings had graciously granted to the Jews at the instance of
John, father of that Eupolemus who was later to be sent on an embassy to negotiate a treaty of friendship and
alliance with the Romans and, overthrowing the lawful institutions, introduced new usages contrary to the Law.
2Ma 4:12 He went so far as to found a gymnasium at the very foot of the Citadel, and to fit out the noblest of his
young men in the petasos.

2Ma 4:13 Godless wretch that he was and no true high priest, Jason set no bounds to his impiety; indeed the
hellenising process reached such a pitch

2Ma 4:14 that the priests ceased to show any interest in serving the altar; but, scorning the Temple and
neglecting the sacrifices, they would hurry, on the stroke of the gong, to take part in the distribution, forbidden by
the Law, of the oil on the exercise ground;

2Ma 4:15 setting no store by the honours of their fatherland, they esteemed hellenic glories best of all.

2Ma 4:16 But all this brought its own retribution; the very people whose way of life they envied, whom they
sought to resemble in everything, proved to be their enemies and executioners.

2Ma 4:17 It is no small thing to violate the divine laws, as the period that followed will demonstrate.

2Ma 4:18 On the occasion of the quadrennial games at Tyre in the presence of the king,

2Ma 4:19 the vile Jason sent an embassy of Antiochists from Jerusalem, taking with them three hundred silver
drachmas for the sacrifice to Hercules. But even those who brought the money did not think it would be right to
spend it on the sacrifice and decided to reserve it for some other item of expenditure;

2Ma 4:20 and so what the sender had intended for the sacrifice to Hercules was in fact applied, at the
suggestion of those who brought it, to the construction of triremes.

2Ma 4:21 Apollonius son of Menestheus had been sent to Egypt to attend the wedding of King Philometor.
Antiochus, having learnt that the latter had become hostile to his affairs, began thinking about his own safety:
that was why he had come to Joppa. He then moved to Jerusalem,

2Ma 4:22 where he was given a magnificent welcome by Jason and the city, and escorted in by torchlight with
acclamation. After which, he marched his army into Phoenicia.

2Ma 4:23 When three years had passed, Jason sent Menelaus, brother of the Simon mentioned above, to
convey the money to the king and to complete negotiations on various essential matters.

2Ma 4:24 But Menelaus, on being presented to the king, flattered him by his own appearance of authority, and
so secured the high priesthood for himself, outbidding Jason by three hundred talants of silver.



2Ma 4:25 He returned with the royal mandate, bringing nothing worthy of the high priesthood and supported
only by the fury of a cruel tyrant and the rage of a savage beast.

2Ma 4:26 Thus Jason, who had supplanted his own brother, was in turn supplanted by a third, and obliged to
take refuge in Ammanitis.

2Ma 4:27 As for Menelaus, he secured the office, but defaulted altogether on the sums promised to the king,
2Ma 4:28 although Sostratus, the commandant of the Citadel, whose business it was to collect the revenue,
kept demanding payment. The pair of them in consequence were summoned before the king,

2Ma 4:29 Menelaus leaving his brother Lysimachus as deputy high priest, while Sostratus left Crates, the
commander of the Cypriots, to act for him.

2Ma 4:30 While all this was going on, it happened that the people of Tarsus and Mallus revolted, because their
towns had been given as a present to Antiochis, the king’s concubine.

2Ma 4:31 The king therefore hurried off to settle the affair, leaving Andronicus, one of his dignitaries, to act as
his deputy.

2Ma 4:32 Thinking he had found a favourable opportunity, Menelaus abstracted a number of golden vessels
from the Temple and presented them to Andronicus, and managed to sell others to Tyre and the surrounding
cities.

2Ma 4:33 On receiving clear evidence to this effect, Onias retired to a place of sanctuary at Daphne near
Antioch and then taxed him with it.

2Ma 4:34 Menelaus then had a quiet word with Andronicus, urging him to get rid of Onias. Andronicus sought
out Onias and, resorting to the trick of offering him his right hand on oath, succeeded in persuading him, despite
the latter’s lingering suspicions, to leave sanctuary; whereüpon, in defiance of all justice, he immediately put him
to death.

2Ma 4:35 The result was that not only Jews but many people of other nationalities were appalled and outraged
by the unjust murder of this man.

2Ma 4:36 On the king’s return from the region of Cilicia, the Jews of the capital, and those Greeks who shared
their hatred of the crime, appealed to him about the unjustified murder of Onias.

2Ma 4:37 Antiochus was profoundly grieved and filled with pity, and he wept for the prudence and moderation of
the dead man.

2Ma 4:38 Burning with indignation, he immediately stripped Andronicus of the purple, tore his garments off him
and, parading him through the length of the city, rid the world of the assassin on the very spot where he had laid
impious hands on Onias, the Lord dealing out to him the punishment he deserved.

2Ma 4:39 Now Lysimachus with the connivance of Menelaus had committed many sacrilegious thefts in the city,
and when the facts became widely known, the populace rose against Lysimachus, who had already disposed of
many pieces of gold plate.

2Ma 4:40 The infuriated mob was becoming menacing, and Lysimachus armed nearly three thousand men and
took aggressive action; the troops were led by a certain Auranus, a man advanced in years and no less in folly.
2Ma 4:41 Recognising this act of aggression as the work of Lysimachus, some snatched up stones, others
cudgels, while others scooped up handfuls of ashes lying at hand, and all hurled everything indiscriminately at
Lysimachus’ men,

2Ma 4:42 to such effect that they wounded many of them, even killing a few, and routed them all; the
sacrilegious thief himself they killed near the Treasury.

2Ma 4:43 As a result of this, legal proceedings were taken against Menelaus.

2Ma 4:44 When the king came down to Tyre, three men deputed by the Senate pleaded their case before him.
2Ma 4:45 Menelaus, seeing the case had gone against him, promised a substantial sum to Ptolemy son of
Dorymenes if he would influence the king in his favour.

2Ma 4:46 Ptolemy then took the king aside into a colonnade, as though for a breath of fresh air, and persuaded
him to change his mind;

2Ma 4:47 the king then dismissed the charges against Menelaus, the cause of all this evil, while he condemned
to death the other poor wretches who, had they pleaded even before Scythians, would have been let off scot-
free.

2Ma 4:48 No time was lost in carrying out this unjust punishment on those who had championed the cause of
the city, the townships and the sacred vessels.

2Ma 4:49 Some Tyrians even were so outraged by the crime that they provided sumptuously for their funeral,
2Ma 4:50 while, as a result of the greed of the powerful, Menelaus remained in power, growing more wicked
than ever and establishing himself as the chief enemy of his fellow-citizens.

2Ma 5:1 At about this time, Antiochus was preparing for his second attack on Egypt.

2Ma 5:2 It then happened that all over the city for nearly forty days there were apparitions of horsemen
galloping through the air in cloth of gold, troops of lancers fully armed,

2Ma 5:3 squadrons of cavalry in order of battle, attacks and charges this way and that, a flourish of shields, a



forest of pikes, a brandishing of swords, a hurling of missiles, a glittering of golden accoutrements and armour of
all kinds.

2Ma 5:4 So everyone prayed that this manifestation might prove a good omen.

2Ma 5:5 Then, on the strength of a false report that Antiochus was dead, Jason took at least a thousand men
and launched an unexpected attack on the city. When the walls had been breached and the city was finally on
the point of being taken, Menelaus took refuge in the Citadel.

2Ma 5:6 Jason, however, made a pitiless slaughter of his fellow-citizens, oblivious of the fact that success
against his own countrymen was the greatest of disasters, but rather picturing himself as winning trophies from
some enemy, and not from his fellow- countrymen.

2Ma 5:7 Even so, he did not manage to seize power; and, in the end, his machinations brought him nothing but
shame, and he took refuge once more in Ammanitis.

2Ma 5:8 His career of wickedness was thus brought to a halt: imprisoned by Aretas, the Arab despot, escaping
from his town, hunted by everyone, detested for having overthrown the laws, abhorred as the butcher of his
country and his countrymen, he drifted to Egypt.

2Ma 5:9 He who had exiled so many from their fatherland, himself perished on foreign soil, having travelled to
Sparta, hoping that, for kinship’s sake, he might find harbour there.

2Ma 5:10 So many carcases he had thrust out to lie unburied; now he himself had none to mourn him, no
funeral rites, no place in the tomb of his ancestors.

2Ma 5:1 1 When the king came to hear of what had happened, he concluded that Judaea was in revolt. He
therefore marched from Egypt, raging like a wild beast, and began by storming the city.

2Ma 5:12 He then ordered his soldiers to cut down without mercy everyone they encountered, and to butcher all
who took refuge in their houses.

2Ma 5:13 It was a massacre of young and old, a slaughter of women and children, a butchery of young girls and
infants.

2Ma 5:14 There were eighty thousand victims in the course of those three days, forty thousand dying by
violence and as many again being sold into slavery.

2Ma 5:15 Not content with this, he had the audacity to enter the holiest Temple in the entire world, with
Menelaus, that traitor to the laws and to his country, as his guide;

2Ma 5:16 with impure hands he seized the sacred vessels; with impious hands he seized the offerings
presented by other kings for the aggrandisement, glory and dignity of the holy place.

2Ma 5:17 Holding so high an opinion of himself, Antiochus did not realise that the Lord was temporarily angry at
the sins of the inhabitants of the city, hence his unconcern for the holy place.

2Ma 5:18 Had they not been entangled in many sins, Antiochus too, like Heliodorus when King Seleucus sent
him to inspect the Treasury, would have been flogged the moment he arrived and checked in his presumption.
2Ma 5:19 The Lord, however, had not chosen the people for the sake of the holy place, but the holy place for
the sake of the people;

2Ma 5:20 and so the holy place itself, having shared the disasters that befell the people, in due course also
shared their good fortune; having been abandoned by the Almighty in his anger, once the great Sovereign was
placated it was reinstated in all its glory.

2Ma 5:21 Antiochus, having extracted eighteen hundred talants from the Temple, hurried back to Antioch; in his
pride he would have undertaken to make the dry land navigable and the sea passable on foot, so high his
arrogance soared.

2Ma 5:22 But he left officials behind to plague the nation: in Jerusalem, Philip, a Phrygian by race, and by
nature more barbarous than the man who appointed him;

2Ma 5:23 on Mount Gerizim, Andronicus; and, besides these, Menelaus, who lorded it over his countrymen
worse than all the others. In his rooted hostility to the Jews,

2Ma 5:24 the king also sent the Mysarch Apollonius at the head of an army twenty-two thousand strong, with
orders to put to death all men in their prime and to sell the women and children.

2Ma 5:25 Arriving in Jerusalem and posing as a man of peace, this man waited until the holy day of the Sabbath
and then, taking advantage of the Jews as they rested from work, ordered his men to parade fully armed;

2Ma 5:26 all those who came out to watch he put to the sword; then, rushing into the city with his armed troops,
he cut down an immense number of people.

2Ma 5:27 Judas, also known as Maccabaeus, however, with about nine others, withdrew into the desert. He
lived like the wild animals in the hills with his companions, eating nothing but wild plants to avoid contracting
defilement.

2Ma 6:1 Shortly afterwards, the king sent Gerontes the Athenian to force the Jews to violate their ancestral
customs and live no longer by the laws of God;

2Ma 6:2 and to profane the Temple in Jerusalem and dedicate it to Olympian Zeus, and the one on Mount
Gerizim to Zeus, Patron of Strangers, as the inhabitants of the latter place had requested.



2Ma 6:3 The advent of these evils was painfully hard for all the people to bear.

2Ma 6:4 The Temple was filled with revelling and debauchery by the gentiles, who took their pleasure with
prostitutes and had intercourse with women in the sacred precincts, introducing other indecencies besides.

2Ma 6:5 The altar of sacrifice was loaded with victims proscribed by the law as profane.

2Ma 6:6 No one might either keep the Sabbath or observe the traditional feasts, or so much as admit to being a
Jew.

2Ma 6:7 People were driven by harsh compulsion to take part in the monthly ritual meal commemorating the
king’s birthday; and when a feast of Dionysus occurred, they were forced to wear ivy wreaths and walk in the
Dionysiac procession.

2Ma 6:8 A decree was issued at the instance of the people of Ptolemais for the neighbouring Greek cities,
enforcing the same conduct on the Jews there, obliging them to share in the sacrificial meals,

2Ma 6:9 and ordering the execution of those who would not voluntarily conform to Greek customs. So it became
clear that disaster was imminent.

2Ma 6:10 For example, two women were charged with having circumcised their children. They were paraded
publicly round the town, with their babies hung at their breasts, and then hurled over the city wall.

2Ma 6:1 1 Other people, who had assembled in some near-by caves to keep the seventh day without attracting
attention, were denounced to Philip, and were then all burnt to death together, since their consciences would not
allow them to defend themselves, out of respect for the holiness of the day.

2Ma 6:12 Now, I urge anyone who may read this book not to be dismayed at these calamities, but to reflect that
such visitations are intended not to destroy our race but to discipline it.

2Ma 6:13 Indeed, when evil-doers are not left for long to their own devices but incur swift retribution, it is a sign
of great benevolence.

2Ma 6:14 In the case of other nations, the Master waits patiently for them to attain the full measure of their sins
before he punishes them, but with us he has decided to deal differently,

2Ma 6:15 rather than have to punish us later, when our sins come to full measure.

2Ma 6:16 And so he never entirely withdraws his mercy from us; he may discipline us by some disaster, but he
does not desert his own people.

2Ma 6:17 Let this be said simply by way of reminder; we must return to our story without more ado.

2Ma 6:18 Eleazar, one of the foremost teachers of the Law, a man already advanced in years and of most noble
appearance, had his mouth forced open, to make him eat a piece of pork.

2Ma 6:19 But he, resolving to die with honour rather than to live disgraced, walked of his own accord to the
torture of the wheel,

2Ma 6:20 having spat the stuff out, as befits those with the courage to reject what is not lawful to taste, rather
than live.

2Ma 6:21 The people supervising the ritual meal, forbidden by the Law, because of the length of time for which
they had known him, took him aside and privately urged him to have meat brought of a kind he could properly
use, prepared by himself, and only pretend to eat the portions of sacrificial meat as prescribed by the king;

2Ma 6:22 this action would enable him to escape death, by availing himself of an act of kindness prompted by
their long friendship.

2Ma 6:23 But having taken a noble decision worthy of his years and the dignity of his great age and the well-
earned distinction of his grey hairs, worthy too of his impeccable conduct from boyhood, and above all of the
holy legislation established by God himself, he answered accordingly, telling them to send him at once to Hades.
2Ma 6:24 “Pretence”, he said, “does not befit our time of life; many young people would suppose that Eleazar at
the age of ninety had conformed to the foreigners’ way of life

2Ma 6:25 and, because I had played this part for the sake of a paltry brief spell of life, might themselves be led
astray on my account; I should only bring defilement and disgrace on my old age.

2Ma 6:26 Even though for the moment I avoid execution by man, I can never, living or dead, elude the grasp of
the Almighty.

2Ma 6:27 Therefore if I am man enough to quit this life here and now, I shall prove myself worthy of my old age,
2Ma 6:28 and I shall have left the young a noble example of how to make a good death, eagerly and
generously, for the venerable and holy laws”. So saying, he walked straight to the wheel,

2Ma 6:29 while those who were escorting him, recently so well disposed towards him, turned against him after
this declaration, which they regarded as sheer madness.

2Ma 6:30 He for his part, just before he died under the blows, gave a sigh and said, “The Lord whose knowledge
is holy sees clearly that, though I might have escaped death, from awe of him I gladly endure these agonies of
body under the lash, and that in my soul I am glad to suffer”.

2Ma 6:31 This was how he died, leaving his death as an example of nobility and a record of virtue not only for
the young but for the greater part of the nation.

2Ma 7:1 It also happened that seven brothers were arrested with their mother. The king tried to force them to



taste some pork, which the Law forbids, by torturing them with whips and scourges.

2Ma 7:2 One of them, acting as spokesman for the others, said, “What are you trying to find out from us? We
are prepared to die rather than break the laws of our ancestors”.

2Ma 7:3 The king, in a fury, ordered pans and cauldrons to be heated over a fire.

2Ma 7:4 As soon as these were red-hot, he commanded that their spokesman should have his tongue cut out,
his head scalped and his extremities cut off, while the other brothers and his mother looked on.

2Ma 7:5 When he had been rendered completely helpless, the king gave orders for him to be brought, still
breathing, to the fire and fried alive in a pan. As the smoke from the pan drifted about, his mother and the rest
encouraged one another to die nobly, with such words as these,

2Ma 7:6 “The Lord God is watching and certainly feels sorry for us, as Moses declared in his song, which clearly
states that ‘he will take pity on his servants’”.

2Ma 7:7 When the first had left the world in this way, they brought the second forward to be tortured. After
stripping the skin from his head, hair and all, they asked him, “Will you eat some pork, before your body is
tortured limb by limb?”.

2Ma 7:8 Replying in his ancestral tongue, he said, “No!”. So he too was put to the torture in his turn.

2Ma 7:9 With his last breath he exclaimed, “Cruel brute, you may discharge us from this present life, but the
King of the world will raise us up, since we die for his laws, to live again for ever”.

2Ma 7:10 After him, they tortured the third, who on being asked for his tongue promptly thrust it out and boldly
held out his hands,

2Ma 7:1 1 courageously saying, “Heaven gave me these limbs; for the sake of his laws I have no concern for
them; from him I hope to receive them again”.

2Ma 7:12 The king and his attendants were astounded at the young man’s courage and his utter indifference to
suffering.

2Ma 7:13 When this one was dead they subjected the fourth to the same torments and tortures.

2Ma 7:14 When he neared his end he cried, “Ours is the better choice, to meet death at men’s hands, yet relying
on God’s promise that we shall be raised up by him; whereäs for you there can be no resurrection to new life”.
2Ma 7:15 Next they brought forward the fifth and began torturing him.

2Ma 7:16 But he looked at the king and said, “You have power over human beings, mortal as you are, and can
act as you please. But do not think that our race has been deserted by God.

2Ma 7:17 Only wait, and you will see in your turn how his mighty power will torment you and your descendants”.
2Ma 7:18 After him, they led out the sixth, and his dying words were these, “Do not delude yourself: we are
suffering like this through our own fault, having sinned against our own God; hence, appalling things have
befallen us-

2Ma 7:19 but do not think you yourself will go unpunished for attempting to make war on God”.

2Ma 7:20 But the mother was especially admirable and worthy of honourable remembrance, for she watched
the death of seven sons in the course of a single day, and bravely endured it because of her hopes in the Lord.
2Ma 7:21 Indeed she encouraged each of them in their ancestral tongue; filled with noble conviction, she
reïnforced her womanly argument with manly courage, saying to them,

2Ma 7:22 “I do not know how you appeared in my womb; it was not I who endowed you with breath and life, I
had not the shaping of your every part.

2Ma 7:23 And hence, the Creator of the world, who made everyone and ordained the origin of all things, will in
his mercy give you back breath and life, since for the sake of his laws you have no concern for yourselves”.

2Ma 7:24 Antiochus thought he was being ridiculed, suspecting insult in the tone of her voice; and as the
youngest was still alive he appealed to him not with mere words but with promises on oath to make him both rich
and happy if he would abandon the traditions of his ancestors; he would make him his Friend and entrust him
with public office.

2Ma 7:25 The young man took no notice at all, and so the king then appealed to the mother, urging her to
advise the youth to save his life.

2Ma 7:26 After a great deal of urging on his part she agreed to try persuasion on her son.

2Ma 7:27 Bending over him, she fooled the cruel tyrant with these words, uttered in their ancestral tongue, “My
son, have pity on me; I carried you nine months in my womb and suckled you three years, fed you and reared
you to the age you are now, and provided for you.

2Ma 7:28 I implore you, my child, look at the earth and sky and everything in them, and consider how God made
them out of what did not exist, and that human beings come into being in the same way.

2Ma 7:29 Do not fear this executioner, but prove yourself worthy of your brothers and accept death, so that I
may receive you back with them in the day of mercy”.

2Ma 7:30 She had hardly finished, when the young man said, “What are you all waiting for? I will not comply
with the king’s ordinance; I obey the ordinance of the Law given to our ancestors through Moses.

2Ma 7:31 As for you, who have contrived every kind of evil against the Hebrews, you will certainly not escape



the hands of God.

2Ma 7:32 We are suffering for our own sins;

2Ma 7:33 and if, to punish and discipline us, our living Lord is briefly angry with us, he will be reconciled with us
in due course.

2Ma 7:34 But you, unholy wretch and wickedest of villains, what cause have you for pride, nourishing vain
hopes and raising your hand against his servants? -

2Ma 7:35 for you have not yet escaped the judgement of God the almighty, the all-seeing.

2Ma 7:36 Our brothers, having endured brief pain, for the sake of ever-flowing life have died for the covenant of
God, while you, by God’s judgement, will have to pay the just penalty for your arrogance.

2Ma 7:37 I too, like my brothers, surrender my body and life for the laws of my ancestors, begging God quickly
to take pity on our nation, and by trials and afflictions to bring you to confess that he alone is God,

2Ma 7:38 so that with my brothers and myself there may be an end to the wrath of the Almighty, rightly let loose
on our whole nation”.

2Ma 7:39 The king fell into a rage and treated this one more cruelly than the others, for he was himself smarting
from the young man’s scorn.

2Ma 7:40 And so the last brother met his end undefiled and with perfect trust in the Lord.

2Ma 7:41 The mother was the last to die, after her sons.

2Ma 7:42 But let this be sufficient account of the ritual meals and monstrous tortures.

2Ma 8:1 Judas, otherwise known as Maccabaeus, and his companions made their way secretly among the
villages, rallying their fellow-countrymen; they recruited those who remained loyal to Judaism and assembled
about six thousand.

2Ma 8:2 They called on the Lord to have regard for the people oppressed on all sides, to take pity on the
Temple profaned by the godless,

2Ma 8:3 to have mercy on the city now being destroyed and levelled to the ground, to hear the blood of the
victims that cried aloud to him,

2Ma 8:4 to remember too the criminal slaughter of innocent babies and to avenge the blasphemies perpetrated
against his name.

2Ma 8:5 As soon as Maccabaeus had an organised force, he at once proved invincible to the foreigners, the
Lord’s anger having turned into compassion.

2Ma 8:6 Making surprise attacks on towns and villages, he fired them; he captured favourable positions and
inflicted very heavy losses on the enemy,

2Ma 8:7 generally availing himself of the cover of night for such enterprises. The fame of his valour spread far
and wide.

2Ma 8:8 When Philip saw Judas was making steady progress and winning more and more frequent successes,
he wrote to Ptolemy, the general officer commanding Coele-Syria and Phoenicia, asking for reinforcements in
the royal interest.

2Ma 8:9 Ptolemy chose Nicanor son of Patroclus, one of the king’s First Friends, and sent him without delay at
the head of an international force of at least twenty thousand men to exterminate the entire Jewish race. As his
associate he appointed Gorgias, a professional general of wide military experience.

2Ma 8:10 Nicanor for his part proposed, by the sale of Jewish prisoners of war, to raise the two thousand talants
of tribute money owed by the king to the Romans.

2Ma 8:1 1 He lost no time in sending the seaboard towns an invitation to come and buy Jewish manpower,
promising delivery of ninety head for one talant; but he did not reckon on the judgement from the Almighty that
was soon to overtake him.

2Ma 8:12 When news reached Judas of Nicanor’s advance, he warned his men of the enemy’s approach,

2Ma 8:13 whereüpon the cowardly ones and those who lacked confidence in the justice of God took to their
heels and ran away.

2Ma 8:14 The rest sold all their remaining possessions, at the same time praying the Lord to deliver them from
the godless Nicanor, who had sold them even in advance of any encounter-

2Ma 8:15 if not for their own sakes, then at least out of consideration for the covenants made with their
ancestors, and because they themselves bore his sacred and majestic name.

2Ma 8:16 Maccabaeus marshalled his men, who numbered about six thousand, and exhorted them not to be
dismayed at the enemy or discouraged at the vast horde of gentiles wickedly advancing against them, but to
fight bravely,

2Ma 8:17 keeping before their eyes the outrage committed by them against the holy place and the infamous and
scornful treatment inflicted on the city, not to mention the destruction of their traditional way of life.

2Ma 8:18 “They may put their trust in their weapons and their exploits”, he said, “but our confidence is in almighty
God, who is able with a single nod to overthrow both those marching on us and the whole world with them”.

2Ma 8:19 He reminded them of the occasions on which their ancestors had received help: that time when, under



Sennacherib, a hundred and eighty-five thousand men had perished;

2Ma 8:20 that time in Babylonia when in the battle with the Galatians the Jewish combatants numbered only
eight thousand, with four thousand Macedonians, yet when the Macedonians were hard pressed, the eight
thousand had destroyed a hundred and twenty thousand, thanks to the help they had received from Heaven, and
had taken great booty as a result.

2Ma 8:21 Having so roused their courage by these words that they were ready to die for the laws and their
country, he then divided his army into four,

2Ma 8:22 putting his brothers, Simon, Joseph and Jonathan in command of one division each, and assigning
them fifteen hundred men apiece.

2Ma 8:23 Next, he ordered Esdrias to read the Holy Book aloud and gave them their watchword ‘Help from
God’. Then, putting himself at the head of the first division, he attacked Nicanor.

2Ma 8:24 With the Almighty for their ally they slaughtered over nine thousand of the enemy, wounded and
crippled the greater part of Nicanor’s army and put them all to flight.

2Ma 8:25 The money of their prospective purchasers fell into their hands. After pursuing them for a good while,
they turned back, since time was pressing:

2Ma 8:26 it was the eve of the Sabbath, and for that reason they did not prolong their pursuit.

2Ma 8:27 They collected the enemy’s weapons and stripped them of their spoils, and because of the Sabbath
even more heartily blessed and praised the Lord, who had saved them and who had chosen that day for the first
manifestation of his compassion.

2Ma 8:28 When the Sabbath was over, they distributed some of the booty among the victims of the persecution
and the widows and orphans; the rest they divided among themselves and their children.

2Ma 8:29 They then joined in public supplication, imploring the merciful Lord to be fully reconciled with his
servants.

2Ma 8:30 They also challenged the forces of Timotheus and Bacchides and destroyed over twenty thousand of
them, gaining possession of several high fortresses. They divided their enormous booty into two equal shares,
one for themselves, the other for the victims of the persecution and the orphans and widows, not forgetting the
aged.

2Ma 8:31 They carefully collected the enemy’s weapons and stored them in suitable places. The rest of the
spoils they took to Jerusalem.

2Ma 8:32 They killed the tribal chieftain on Timotheus’ staff, an extremely wicked man who had done great harm
to the Jews.

2Ma 8:33 In the course of their victory celebrations in Jerusalem, they burned the men who had fired the Holy
Gates; with Callisthenes they had taken refuge in one small house; so these received a fitting reward for their
sacrilege.

2Ma 8:34 The triple-dyed scoundrel Nicanor, who had brought the thousand merchants to buy the Jews,

2Ma 8:35 finding himself with the Lord’s help humbled by men he had himself reckoned as of very little account,
stripped off his robes of state, and made his way across country unaccompanied, like a runaway slave, reaching
Antioch by a singular stroke of fortune, since his army had been destroyed.

2Ma 8:36 Thus the man who had promised the Romans to make good their tribute money by selling the
prisoners from Jerusalem, bore witness that the Jews had a defender and that they were in consequence
invulnerable, since they followed the laws which that defender had ordained.

2Ma 9:1 At about the same time, Antiochus was beating a disorderly retreat from Persia.

2Ma 9:2 He had entered the city called Persepolis, planning to rob the temple and occupy the city; but the
population at once sprang to arms to defend themselves, with the result that Antiochus was routed by the
inhabitants and forced to beat a humiliating retreat.

2Ma 9:3 On his arrival in Ecbatana he learned what had happened to Nicanor and to Timotheus’ forces.

2Ma 9:4 Flying into a passion, he resolved to make the Jews pay for the disgrace inflicted by those who had
routed him, and with this in mind he ordered his charioteer to drive without stopping and get the journey over.

But the sentence of Heaven was already hanging over him. In his pride, he had said, “When I reach Jerusalem, I
shall turn it into a mass grave for the Jews”.

2Ma 9:5 But the all-seeing Lord, the God of Israel, struck him with an incurable and unseen complaint. The
words were hardly out of his mouth when he was seized with an incurable pain in his bowels and with
excruciating internal torture;

2Ma 9:6 and this was only right, since he had inflicted many barbaric tortures on the bowels of others.

2Ma 9:7 Even so, he in no way diminished his arrogance; still bursting with pride, breathing fire in his wrath
against the Jews, he was in the act of ordering an even keener pace when the chariot gave a sudden lurch and
out he fell and, in this serious fall, was dragged along, every joint of his body wrenched out of place.

2Ma 9:8 He who only a little while before had thought in his superhuman boastfulness he could command the
waves of the sea, he who had imagined he could weigh mountain peaks in a balance, found himself flat on the



ground and then being carried in a litter, a visible demonstration to all of the power of God,

2Ma 9:9 in that the very eyes of this godless man teemed with worms and his flesh rotted away while he
lingered on in agonising pain, and the stench of his decay sickened the whole army.

2Ma 9:10 A short while before, he had thought to grasp the stars of heaven; now no one could bring himself to
act as his bearer, for the stench was intolerable.

2Ma 9:1 1 Then and there, as a consequence, in his shattered state, he began to shed his excessive pride and
come to his senses under the divine lash, spasms of pain overtaking him.

2Ma 9:12 His stench being unbearable even to himself, he exclaimed, “It is right to submit to God; no mortal
should aspire to equality with the Godhead”.

2Ma 9:13 The wretch began to pray to the Master, who would never take pity on him now, declaring

2Ma 9:14 that the holy city, towards which he had been speeding to rase it to the ground and turn it into a mass

grave, should be declared free;

2Ma 9:15 as for the Jews, whom he had considered as not even worth burying, so much carrion to be thrown
out with their children for birds and beasts to prey on, he would give them all equal rights with the Athenians;

2Ma 9:16 the holy Temple which he had once plundered he would now adorn with the finest offerings; he would
restore all the sacred vessels many times over; he would defray from his personal revenue the expenses
incurred for the sacrifices;

2Ma 9:17 and, to crown all, he would himself turn Jew and visit every inhabited place, proclaiming the power of
God.

2Ma 9:18 Finding no respite at all from his suffering, God’s just sentence having overtaken him, he abandoned
all hope for himself and wrote the Jews the letter transcribed below, which takes the form of an appeal in these
terms:

2Ma 9:19 “To the excellent Jews, to the citizens, Antiochus, king and commander-in-chief, sends hearty
greetings, wishing them all health and prosperity.

2Ma 9:20 “If you and your children are well and your affairs as you would wish, we are profoundly thankful.

2Ma 9:21 For my part, I cherish affectionate memories of you. “On my return from the country of Persia I fell
seriously ill, and thought it necessary to make provision for the common security of all.

2Ma 9:22 Not that I despair of my condition, for I have great hope of shaking off the malady,

2Ma 9:23 but considering how my father, whenever he was making an expedition into the uplands, would
designate his successor

2Ma 9:24 so that, in case of any unforeseen event or disquieting rumour, the people of the provinces might
know to whom he had left the conduct of affairs, and thus remain undisturbed;

2Ma 9:25 furthermore, being well aware that the sovereigns on our frontiers and the neighbours of our realm are
watching for opportunities and waiting to see what will happen, I have designated as king my son Antiochus,
whom I have more than once entrusted and commended to most of you when I was setting out for the upland
satrapies; a transcript of my letter to him is appended hereto.

2Ma 9:26 I therefore urge and require you, being mindful of the benefits both public and personal received from
me, that you each persist in those sentiments of goodwill that you harbour towards me.

2Ma 9:27 I am confident that he will pursue my own policy with benevolence and humanity, and will prove
accommodating to your interests”.

2Ma 9:28 And so this murderer and blasphemer, having endured sufferings as terrible as those which he had
made others endure, met his pitiable fate, and ended his life in the mountains far from his home.

2Ma 9:29 His comrade Philip brought back his body, and then, fearing Antiochus’ son, withdrew to Egypt, to the
court of Ptolemy Philometor.

2Ma 10:1 Maccabaeus and his companions, under the Lord’s guidance, restored the Temple and the city,

2Ma 10:2 and pulled down the altars erected by the foreigners in the market place, as well as the shrines.

2Ma 10:3 They purified the sanctuary and built another altar; then, striking fire from flints and using this fire, they
offered the first sacrifice for two years, burning incense, lighting the lamps and setting out the loaves.

2Ma 10:4 When they had done this, prostrating themselves on the ground, they implored the Lord never again
to let them fall into such adversity, but if they should ever sin, to correct them with moderation and not to deliver
them over to blasphemous and barbarous nations.

2Ma 10:5 This day of the purification of the Temple fell on the very day on which the Temple had been profaned
by the foreigners, the twenty-fifth of the same month, Chislev.

2Ma 1 0:6 They kept eight festal days with rejoicing, in the manner of the feast of Shelters, remembering how,
not long before at the time of the feast of Shelters, they had been living in the mountains and caverns like wild
beasts.

2Ma 10:7 Then, carrying thyrsuses, leafy boughs and palms, they offered hymns to him who had brought the
cleansing of his own holy place to a happy outcome.

2Ma 10:8 They also decreed by public edict, ratified by vote, that the whole Jewish nation should celebrate



those same days every year.

2Ma 10:9 Such were the circumstances attending the death of Antiochus styled Epiphanes.

2Ma 10:10 Our task now is to unfold the history of Antiochus Eupator, son of that godless man, and briefly to
relate the evil effects of the wars.

2Ma 10:1 1 On coming to the throne, this prince put at the head of affairs a certain Lysias, the general officer
commanding Coele-Syria and Phoenicia,

2Ma 10:12 whereäs Ptolemy, known as Macron, and the first person to govern the Jews justly, had done his
best to govern them peacefully to make up for the wrongs inflicted on them in the past.

2Ma 10:13 Denounced, in consequence, to Eupator by the Friends of the King, he heard himself called traitor at
every turn: for having abandoned Cyprus, which had been entrusted to him by Philometer, for having gone over
to Antiochus Epiphanes, and for having shed no lustre on his illustrious office: he committed suicide by poisoning
himself.

2Ma 10:14 Gorgias now became general of the area; he maintained a force of mercenaries and a continual
state of war with the Jews.

2Ma 10:15 At the same time, the Idumaeans, who controlled important fortresses, were harassing the Jews,
welcoming outlaws from Jerusalem and endeavouring to maintain a state of war.

2Ma 10:16 Maccabaeus and his men, after making public supplication to God, entreating him to support them,
began operations against the Idumaean fortresses.

2Ma 10:17 Vigorously pressing home their attack, they seized possession of these vantage points, beating off
all who fought on the ramparts; they slaughtered all who fell into their hands, accounting for no fewer than twenty
thousand.

2Ma 10:18 Nine thousand at least took refuge in two exceptionally strong towers with everything they needed to
withstand a siege,

2Ma 10:19 whereüpon, Maccabaeus left Simon and Joseph, with Zacchaeus and his forces, in sufficient
numbers to besiege them, and himself went off to other places requiring his attention.

2Ma 10:20 But Simon’s men were greedy for money and allowed themselves to be bribed by some of the men
in the towers; accepting seventy thousand drachmas, they let a number of them escape.

2Ma 10:21 When Maccabaeus was told what had happened, he summoned the people’s commanders and
accused the offenders of having sold their brothers for money by releasing their enemies to fight them.

2Ma 10:22 Having executed them as traitors, he at once proceeded to capture both towers.

2Ma 10:23 Successful in all that he undertook by force of arms, in these two fortresses he slaughtered more
than twenty thousand men.

2Ma 10:24 Timotheus, who had been beaten by the Jews once before, now assembled an enormous force of
mercenaries, mustering cavalry from Asia in considerable numbers, and soon appeared in Judaea, expecting to
conquer it by force of arms.

2Ma 10:25 At his approach, Maccabaeus and his men made their supplications to God, sprinkling earth on their
heads and putting sackcloth round their waists.

2Ma 10:26 Prostrating themselves on the terrace before the altar, they begged him to support them and to show
himself the enemy of their enemies, the adversary of their adversaries, as the Law clearly states.

2Ma 10:27 After these prayers, they armed themselves and advanced a fair distance from the city, halting when
they were close to the enemy.

2Ma 1 0:28 As the first light of dawn began to spread, the two sides joined battle, the one having as their pledge
of success and victory not only their own valour but their recourse to the Lord, the other making their own ardour
their mainstay in the fight.

2Ma 10:29 When the battle was at its height, the enemy saw five magnificent men appear from heaven on
horses with golden bridles and put themselves at the head of the Jews;

2Ma 10:30 surrounding Maccabaeus and screening him with their own armour, they kept him unscathed, while
they rained arrows and thunderbolts on the enemy until, blinded and confused, they scattered in complete
disorder.

2Ma 10:31 Twenty thousand five hundred infantry and six hundred cavalry were slaughtered.

2Ma 10:32 Timotheus himself fled to a strongly guarded citadel called Gezer, where Chaereas was in
command.

2Ma 1 0:33 For four days Maccabaeus and his men eagerly besieged the fortress,

2Ma 10:34 while the defenders, confident in the security of the place, hurled fearful blasphemies and godless
insults at them.

2Ma 10:35 At daybreak on the fifth day, twenty young men of Maccabaeus’ forces, fired with indignation at the
blasphemies, manfully assaulted the wall, with wild courage cutting down everyone they encountered.

2Ma 1 0:36 Others, in a similar scaling operation, took the defenders in the rear, and set fire to the towers,
lighting pyres on which they burned the blasphemers alive. The first, meanwhile, breaking open the gates, let the



rest of the army in and, at their head, captured the town.

2Ma 10:37 Timotheus had hidden in a storage-well, but they killed him, with his brother Chaereas, and
Apollophanes.

2Ma 10:38 When all this was over, with hymns and thanksgiving they blessed the Lord, who had shown such
great kindness to Israel and given them the victory.

2Ma 11:1 Almost immediately afterwards, Lysias, the king’s tutor and cousin, chief minister of the realm, much
disturbed at the turn of events,

2Ma 1 1 :2 mustered about eighty thousand foot soldiers and his entire cavalry and advanced against the Jews,
intending to make the city a place for Greeks to live in,

2Ma 1 1 :3 to levy a tax on the Temple as on other national shrines, and to put the office of high priest up for sale
every year;

2Ma 1 1 :4 he took no account at all of the power of God, being sublimely confident in his tens of thousands of
infantrymen, his thousands of cavalry, and his eighty elephants.

2Ma 1 1 :5 Invading Judaea, he approached Beth-Zur, a fortified position about twenty miles from Jerusalem, and
began to subject it to strong pressure.

2Ma 1 1 :6 When Maccabaeus and his men learned that Lysias was besieging the fortresses, they and the
populace with them begged the Lord with lamentation and tears to send a good angel to save Israel.

2Ma 1 1 :7 Maccabaeus himself was the first to take up his weapons, and he urged the rest to risk their lives with
him in support of their brothers; so they sallied out resolutely, as one man.

2Ma 1 1 :8 They were still near Jerusalem when a rider attired in white appeared at their head, brandishing
golden weapons.

2Ma 1 1 :9 With one accord they all blessed the God of mercy, and found themselves filled with such courage
that they were ready to lay low not men only but the fiercest beasts and walls of iron.

2Ma 11:10 They advanced in battle order with the aid of their celestial ally, the Lord having had mercy on them.
2Ma 11:11 Charging like lions on the enemy, they laid low eleven thousand of the infantry and sixteen hundred
horsemen, and routed all the rest.

2Ma 11:12 Of those, the majority got away, wounded and weaponless. Lysias himself escaped only by
ignominious flight.

2Ma 11:13 Now Lysias was not lacking in intelligence and, as he reflected on the reverse he had just suffered,
he realised that the Hebrews were invincible because the mighty God fought for them. He therefore sent them a
delegation

2Ma 11:14 to persuade them to accept reasonable terms all round, and promised to compel the king to become
their friend.

2Ma 11:15 Maccabaeus, thinking only of the common good, agreed to all that Lysias proposed, and whatever
Maccabaeus submitted to Lysias in writing concerning the Jews was granted by the king.

2Ma 11:16 Here is the text of the letter Lysias wrote to the Jews: “Lysias to the Jewish people, greetings.

2Ma 11:17 “John and Absalom, your envoys, have delivered to me the communication transcribed below,
requesting me to approve its provisions.

2Ma 11:18 Anything requiring the king’s attention I have put before him; whatever was possible, I have granted.
2Ma 11:19 Provided you maintain your goodwill towards the interests of the State, I shall do my best in the
future to promote your well-being.

2Ma 1 1 :20 As regards the details, I have given orders for your envoys and my own officials to discuss these
with you.

2Ma 1 1 :21 May you prosper. “The twenty-fourth day of Dioscorus, in the year one hundred and forty-eight”.

2Ma 1 1 :22 The king’s letter ran as follows: “King Antiochus to his brother Lysias, greetings.

2Ma 1 1 :23 “Now that our father has taken his place among the gods, our will is that the subjects of the realm be
left undisturbed to attend to their own affairs.

2Ma 1 1 :24 We understand that the Jews do not approve our father’s policy, the adoption of Greek customs, but
prefer their own way of life and ask to be allowed to observe their own laws.

2Ma 1 1 :25 Accordingly, since we intend this people to be free from vexation like any other, our ruling is that the
Temple be restored to them and that they conduct their affairs according to the customs of their ancestors.

2Ma 1 1 :26 “It will therefore be your concern to send them a mission of friendship, so that on learning our policy
they may have confidence and happily go about their business”.

2Ma 1 1 :27 The king’s letter to the Jewish nation was in these terms: “King Antiochus to the Jewish Senate and
the rest of the Jews, greetings.

2Ma 1 1 :28 “If you are well, that is as we would wish; we ourselves are in good health.

2Ma 1 1 :29 “Menelaus informs us that you wish to return home and attend to your own affairs.

2Ma 1 1 :30 Accordingly, all those who return before the thirtieth day of Xanthicus may rest assured that they
have nothing to fear.



2Ma 1 1 :31 The Jews may make use of their own kind of food and their own laws as formerly, and none of them
is to be molested in any way for any unwitting offences.

2Ma 1 1 :32 I am in fact sending Menelaus to set your minds at rest.

2Ma 1 1 :33 Farewell. The fifteenth day of Xanthicus in the year one hundred and forty-eight”.

2Ma 1 1 :34 The Romans also sent the Jews a letter, which read as follows: “Quintus Memmius, Titus Manilius,
Manius Sergius, legates of the Romans, to the people of the Jews, greetings.

2Ma 1 1 :35 “Whatever Lysias, the king’s Cousin, has granted you we also approve.

2Ma 1 1 :36 As for the matters he decided to refer to the king, consider them carefully and send someöne without
delay, if we are to interpret them to your advantage, because we are leaving for Antioch.

2Ma 1 1 :37 Lose no time, therefore, in sending us those who can tell us what your intentions are.

2Ma 1 1 :38 Farewell. “The fifteenth day of Dioscorus in the year one hundred and forty-eight”.

2Ma 12:1 These agreements once concluded, Lysias returned to the king and the Jews went back to their
farming.

2Ma 12:2 Among the local generals, Timotheus and Apollonius son of Gennaeus, as also Hieronymus and
Demophon, and Nicanor the Cypriarch as well, would not allow the Jews to live in peace and quiet.

2Ma 12:3 The people of Joppa committed a particularly wicked crime: they invited the Jews living among them
to go aboard some boats they had lying ready, taking their wives and children. There was no hint of any intention
to harm them;

2Ma 12:4 there had been a public vote by the citizens, and the Jews accepted, as well they might, being
peaceable people with no reason to suspect anything. But once out in the open sea they were all sent to the
bottom, a company of at least two hundred.

2Ma 12:5 When Judas heard of the cruel fate of his countrymen, he issued his orders to his men

2Ma 12:6 and after invoking God, the just judge, he attacked his brothers’ murderers. Under cover of dark he

set fire to the port, burned the boats and put to the sword everyone who had taken refuge there.

2Ma 12:7 As the town gates were closed, he withdrew, intending to come back and wipe out the whole
community of Joppa.

2Ma 12:8 But hearing that the people of Jamnia were planning to treat their resident Jews in the same way,

2Ma 1 2:9 he made a night attack on the Jamnites and fired the port with its fleet; the glow of the flames was
seen as far off as Jerusalem, thirty miles away.

2Ma 12:10 When they had left the town barely a mile behind them in their advance on Timotheus, Judas was
attacked by an Arab force of at least five thousand foot soldiers, with five hundred cavalry.

2Ma 12:1 1 A fierce engagement followed, and with God’s help Judas’ men won the day; the defeated nomads
begged Judas to offer them the right hand of friendship, and promised to surrender their herds and make
themselves generally useful to him.

2Ma 12:12 Realising that they might indeed prove valuable in many ways, Judas consented to make peace with
them and after an exchange of pledges the Arabs withdrew to their tents.

2Ma 12:13 Judas also attacked a certain fortified town, closed by ramparts and inhabited by a medley of races;
its name was Caspin.

2Ma 12:14 Confident in the strength of their walls and their stock of provisions, the besieged adopted an
insolent attitude to Judas and his men, reinforcing their insults with blasphemies and profanity.

2Ma 12:15 But Judas and his men invoked the great Sovereign of the world who without battering-ram or siege-
engine had overthrown Jericho in the days of Joshua; they then made a fierce assault on the wall.

2Ma 12:16 By God’s will, having captured the town, they made such indescribable slaughter that the nearby
lake, a quarter of a mile across, seemed filled to overflowing with blood.

2Ma 12:17 Ninety-five miles further on from there, they reached the Charax, in the country of Jews known as
Tubians.

2Ma 12:18 They did not find Timotheus himself in that neighbourhood; he had already left the district, having
achieved nothing apart from leaving a very strong garrison at one point.

2Ma 12:19 Dositheus and Sosipater, two of the Maccabaean generals, marched out and destroyed the force
Timotheus had left behind in the fortress, amounting to more than ten thousand men.

2Ma 12:20 Maccabaeus himself divided his army into cohorts to which he assigned commanders, and then
hurried in pursuit of Timotheus, whose troops numbered one hundred and twenty thousand infantry and two
thousand five hundred cavalry.

2Ma 12:21 Timotheus’ first move on learning of Judas’ advance was to send away the women and children and
the rest of the baggage train to the place called the Carnaim, since it was an impregnable position, difficult of
access owing to the narrowness of all the approaches.

2Ma 12:22 Judas’ cohort came into sight first. The enemy, seized with fright and panic-stricken by the
manifestation of the All-seeing, began to flee, one running this way, one running that, often wounding one
another in consequence and running on the points of one another’s swords.



2Ma 12:23 Judas pursued them with a will, cutting the sinners to pieces and killing something like thirty
thousand men.

2Ma 12:24 Timotheus himself, having fallen into the hands of Dositheus and Sosipater and their men, very
craftily pleaded with them to let him go with his life, on the grounds that he had the relatives and even the
brothers of many of them in his power, and that these could otherwise expect short shrift.

2Ma 12:25 When at long last he convinced them that he would honour his promise and return these people safe
and sound, they let him go for the sake of saving their brothers.

2Ma 12:26 Reaching the Carnaim and the Atargateion, Judas slaughtered twenty-five thousand men.

2Ma 12:27 Having defeated and destroyed them, he led his army against Ephron, a fortified town, where
Lysanias was living. Stalwart young men drawn up outside the walls offered vigorous resistance, while inside
there were quantities of war-engines and missiles in reserve.

2Ma 12:28 But the Jews, having invoked the Sovereign who by his power shatters enemies’ defences, gained
control of the town and cut down nearly twenty-five thousand of the people inside.

2Ma 12:29 Moving off from there, they pressed on to Scythopolis,

2Ma 12:30 seventy-five miles from Jerusalem. But as the Jews who had settled there assured Judas that the
people of Scythopolis had always treated them well and had been particularly kind to them when times were at
their worst,

2Ma 12:31 he and his men thanked them and urged them to extend the same friendship to his race in the future.
They reached Jerusalem shortly before the feast of Weeks.

2Ma 12:32 After Pentecost, as it is called, they marched against Gorgias, the general commanding Idumaea.
2Ma 12:33 He came out at the head of three thousand infantry and four hundred cavalry;

2Ma 12:34 in the course of the ensuing battle a few Jews lost their lives.

2Ma 12:35 A man called Dositheus, a horseman of the Tubian contingent, a valiant man, overpowered Gorgias
and, gripping him by the cloak, was forcibly dragging him along, intending to take the accursed man alive, but
one of the Thracian cavalry, hurling himself on Dositheus, slashed his shoulder, and Gorgias escaped to Marisa.
2Ma 12:36 Meanwhile, since Esdrias and his men had been fighting for a long time and were exhausted, Judas
called on the Lord to show himself their ally and leader in battle.

2Ma 12:37 Then, chanting the battle cry and hymns at the top of his voice in his ancestral tongue, by a surprise
attack he routed Gorgias’ troops.

2Ma 12:38 Judas then rallied his army and moved on to the town of Adullam where, as it was the seventh day of
the week, they purified themselves according to custom and kept the Sabbath.

2Ma 12:39 Next day, they came to find Judas (since the necessity was by now urgent) to have the bodies of the
fallen taken up and laid to rest among their relatives in their ancestral tombs.

2Ma 12:40 But when they found on each of the dead men, under their tunics, objects dedicated to the idols of
Jamnia, which the Law prohibits to Jews, it became clear to everyone that this was why these men had lost their
lives.

2Ma 12:41 All then blessed the ways of the Lord, the upright judge who brings hidden things to light,

2Ma 12:42 and gave themselves to prayer, begging that the sin committed might be completely forgiven. Next,
the valiant Judas urged the soldiers to keep themselves free from all sin, having seen with their own eyes the
effects of the sin of those who had fallen;

2Ma 12:43 after this he took a collection from them individually, amounting to nearly two thousand drachmas,
and sent it to Jerusalem to have a sacrifice for sin offered, an action altogether fine and noble, prompted by his
belief in the resurrection.

2Ma 12:44 For had he not expected the fallen to rise again, it would have been superfluous and foolish to pray
for the dead,

2Ma 12:45 whereäs if he had in view the splendid recompense reserved for those who make a pious end, the
thought was holy and devout. Hence, he had this expiatory sacrifice offered for the dead, so that they might be
released from their sin.

2Ma 13:1 In the year one hundred and forty-nine, Judas and his men discovered that Antiochus Eupatorwas
advancing in force against Judaea,

2Ma 1 3:2 and with him Lysias his tutor and chief minister; he had moreover a Greek force of one hundred and
ten thousand infantry, five thousand three hundred cavalry, twenty-two elephants, and three hundred chariots
fitted with scythes.

2Ma 1 3:3 Menelaus, too, joined them and very craftily kept urging Antiochus on, not for the welfare of his own
country but in the hope of being restored to office.

2Ma 13:4 But the King of kings stirred up the anger of Antiochus against the guilty wretch, and when Lysias
made it clear to the king that Menelaus was the cause of all the troubles, Antiochus gave orders for him to be
taken to Beroea and there put to death by the local method of execution.

2Ma 13:5 In that place there is a tower fifty cubits high, full of ash, with an internal lip all round overhanging the



ashes.

2Ma 1 3:6 If anyone is convicted of sacrilegious theft or of some other heinous crime, he is taken up to the top
and pushed over to perish.

2Ma 13:7 In such a manner was the renegade fated to die; Menelaus had not even the privilege of burial.

2Ma 13:8 Deserved justice, this; since he had committed many sins against the altar, the fire and ashes of
which were holy, it was in ashes that he met his death.

2Ma 13:9 The king, then, was advancing, his mind filled with barbarous designs, to give the Jews a
demonstration of far worse things than anything that had happened under his father.

2Ma 13:10 When Judas heard of this, he ordered the people day and night to call on the Lord as never before,
to come to the help of those who were in peril of being deprived of the Law, their fatherland and the holy Temple,
2Ma 13:1 1 and not to allow the people, just when they were beginning to breathe again, to fall into the power of
ill-famed foreigners.

2Ma 13:12 When they had all, with one voice, obeyed his instructions and had made their petitions to the
merciful Lord, weeping, fasting and prostrating themselves for three days continuously, Judas spoke words of
encouragement and told them to keep close to him.

2Ma 13:13 After separate consultation with the elders, he resolved not to wait for the king’s army to invade
Judaea and take possession of the city, but to march out and settle the whole matter with the Lord’s help.

2Ma 13:14 Having thus committed the outcome to the Creator of the world, and having exhorted his soldiers to
fight bravely to the death for the laws, the Temple, the city, their country and their way of life, he encamped his
army near Modein.

2Ma 13:15 Giving his men the password “Victory from God”, he made a night attack on the king’s pavilion with a
picked band of the bravest young men. Inside the camp he destroyed about two thousand, and his men cut
down the largest of the elephants with its mahout;

2Ma 13:16 having eventually filled the camp with terror and confusion, they successfully withdrew,

2Ma 13:17 just as dawn was breaking. This was achieved, thanks to the protection which the Lord granted
Judas.

2Ma 13:18 The king, having had a taste of Jewish daring, now tried to capture their positions by trickery.

2Ma 13:19 He advanced on Beth-Zur, a strong fortress of the Jews, but was checked, overcome and so
repulsed.

2Ma 13:20 Judas supplied the garrison with what they needed,

2Ma 13:21 but Rhodocus, of the Jewish army, supplied the enemy with secret information; the man was
identified, arrested, and dealt with.

2Ma 13:22 A second time, the king parleyed with the garrison of Beth-Zur; he offered and accepted pledges of
friendship, retired, then attacked Judas and his men, but lost the battle.

2Ma 1 3:23 He was then told that Philip, left in charge of affairs, had rebelled in Antioch. He was stunned by this,
opened negotiations with the Jews, came to an agreement, and swore to abide by all reasonable conditions.
Agreement reached, he offered a sacrifice, honoured the Temple, and made generous gifts to the holy place.
2Ma 13:24 He received Maccabaeus kindly and, leaving Hegemonides to exercise command from Ptolemais to
the territory of the Gerrenians,

2Ma 1 3:25 went to Ptolemais. The inhabitants of the place disapproved of the treaty; they complained furiously
and wanted to annul its provisions.

2Ma 13:26 Lysias mounted the rostrum and made a convincing defence of the provisions which convinced and
calmed them and won their goodwill. He then withdrew to Antioch. So much for the episode of the king’s
offensive and retreat.

2Ma 14:1 Three years after this, Judas and his men learned that Demetrius son of Seleucus had landed at the
port of Tripolis with a strong army and a fleet,

2Ma 14:2 and that he had occupied the country and had killed Antiochus and his tutor Lysias.

2Ma 14:3 A certain Alcimus, a former high priest, had wilfully incurred defilement at the time of the insurrection;
realising that whichever way he turned there was no security for him, nor any further access to the holy altar,

2Ma 14:4 he went to King Demetrius in about the year one hundred and fifty-one and presented him with a
golden crown and a palm, together with the traditional olive branches from the Temple; there, for that day, he let
the matter rest.

2Ma 14:5 Presently he found an opportunity to further his mad plan. When Demetrius called him into his council
and questioned him about the dispositions and intentions of the Jews, he replied,

2Ma 14:6 “Those Jews called Hasidaeans, who are led by Judas Maccabaeus, are war-mongers and rebels who
are preventing the kingdom from finding stability.

2Ma 14:7 That is why, after being deprived of my hereditary dignity — 1 mean the high priesthood — 1 have come
here now,

2Ma 14:8 first out of genuine concern for the king’s interests, and secondly, out of a regard for our own fellow-



citizens, because the irresponsible behaviour of those I have mentioned has brought no slight misery on our
entire race.

2Ma 14:9 When your majesty has taken note of all these points, may it please you to make provision for the
welfare of our country and our oppressed nation, as befits the gracious benevolence you extend to all;

2Ma 14:10 for, as long as Judas remains alive, the State will never enjoy peace”.

2Ma 14:11 No sooner had he spoken thus than the rest of the King’s Friends, who were hostile to Judas’
activities, stoked Demetrius’ anger.

2Ma 14:12 The latter at once selected Nicanor, then commander of the elephants, promoted him to the
command of Judaea and despatched him

2Ma 14:13 with instructions to dispose of Judas, disperse his followers and instal Alcimus as high priest of the
greatest of temples.

2Ma 14:14 The foreigners in Judaea, who had fled before Judas, flocked to join Nicanor, thinking that the
misfortunes and troubles of the Jews would be to their own advantage.

2Ma 14:15 When the Jews heard that Nicanor was coming and that the foreigners were about to attack, they
sprinkled dust over themselves and made supplication to him who had established his people for ever and who
never failed to support his own heritage by direct manifestations.

2Ma 14:16 On their leader’s orders, they at once left the place where they were and confronted the enemy at
the village of Dessau.

2Ma 14:17 Simon, brother of Judas, engaged Nicanor but, owing to the sudden arrival of the enemy, suffered a
slight reverse.

2Ma 14:18 Nicanor, however, had heard how brave Judas and his men were and how resolutely they always
fought for their country, and he did not dare allow bloodshed to decide the issue.

2Ma 14:19 And so he sent Posidonius, Theodotus and Mattathias to offer the Jews pledges of friendship and to
accept theirs.

2Ma 14:20 After careful consideration of his terms, the leader communicated them to his troops, and since they
were all clearly of one mind they agreed to the treaty.

2Ma 14:21 A day was fixed on which the respective leaders were to meet as individuals. A litter came out from
either side and seats were set up.

2Ma 14:22 Judas had posted armed men in strategic positions, in case of a sudden treacherous move by the
enemy. The leaders held their conference and reached agreement.

2Ma 14:23 Nicanor took up residence in Jerusalem and did nothing out of place there; indeed, he sent away the
crowds that had flocked to join him.

2Ma 14:24 He kept Judas constantly with him, becoming deeply attached to him

2Ma 14:25 and encouraged him to marry and have children. Judas married, settled down and led a normal life.
2Ma 14:26 When Alcimus saw how friendly the two men had become, he went to Demetrius with a copy of the
treaty they had signed and told him that Nicanor was harbouring thoughts against the interests of the State, and
was planning that Judas, an enemy of the realm, should fill the next vacancy among the Friends of the King.

2Ma 14:27 The king flew into a rage; roused by the slanders of this villain, he wrote to Nicanor, telling him of his
strong displeasure at these agreements and ordering him immediately to send Maccabaeus to Antioch in chains.
2Ma 14:28 When the letter reached Nicanor, he was very much upset, for he disliked the prospect of breaking
an agreement with a man who had done nothing wrong.

2Ma 14:29 Since, however, there was no way of opposing the king, he waited for an opportunity to carry out the
order by a stratagem.

2Ma 14:30 Maccabaeus began to notice that Nicanor was treating him more sharply and that his manner of
speaking to him was more abrupt than it had been, and he concluded that such sharpness could have no very
good motive. He therefore collected a considerable number of his followers and got away from Nicanor.

2Ma 14:31 The latter, realising that the man had well and truly outmanoeuvred him, went to the greatest and
holiest of Temples when the priests were offering the customary sacrifices, and ordered them to surrender
Judas.

2Ma 14:32 When they protested on oath that they did not know where the wanted man could be,

2Ma 14:33 he stretched out his right hand towards the Temple and swore this oath, “If you do not hand Judas
over to me as prisoner, I shall rase this dwelling of God to the ground, I shall demolish the altar, and on this very
spot I shall erect a splendid temple to Dionysus”.

2Ma 14:34 With these words he left them. The priests stretched out their hands to heaven, calling on him who
has at all times done battle for our nation; this was their prayer:

2Ma 14:35 “O Lord in need of nothing, it has pleased you that the Temple where you dwell should be here with
us.

2Ma 14:36 Now, therefore, holy Lord of all holiness, preserve for ever from all profanation this House, so newly
purified”.



2Ma 14:37 Now, a man called Razis, one of the elders of Jerusalem, was denounced to Nicanor. He was a man
who loved his countrymen and stood high in their esteem, and he was known as the father of the Jews because
of his kindness.

2Ma 14:38 In the earlier days of the insurrection he had been convicted of Judaism, and he had risked both life
and limb for Judaism with the utmost zeal.

2Ma 1 4:39 Nicanor, by way of demonstrating the enmity he had for the Jews, sent over five hundred soldiers to
arrest him,

2Ma 14:40 reckoning that if he eliminated this man he would be dealing them a severe blow.

2Ma 14:41 When the troops were on the point of capturing the tower and were forcing the outer door and calling
for fire to set the doors alight, Razis, finding himself completely surrounded, fell on his own sword,

2Ma 14:42 nobly resolving to die rather than fall into the clutches of these villains and suffer outrages unworthy
of his noble birth.

2Ma 14:43 But in the heat of conflict he missed his thrust, and while the troops swarmed in through the
doorways, he ran nimbly upstairs to the parapet and manfully threw himself down among the troops.

2Ma 14:44 But, as they immediately drew back, he fell into the middle of the empty space.

2Ma 14:45 Still breathing, and blazing with anger, he struggled to his feet, blood spurting in all directions, and
despite his terrible wounds ran right through the crowd; then, taking his stand on a steep rock,

2Ma 14:46 although he had now lost every drop of blood, he tore out his entrails and taking them in both hands
flung them down on the crowd, calling on the Master of his life and spirit to give them back to him one day. Thus
he died.

2Ma 15:1 Nicanor heard that Judas and his men were in the neighbourhood of Samaria, so he decided to attack
them, at no risk to himself, on the day of rest.

2Ma 15:2 Those Jews who had been compelled to follow him, said, “Do not massacre them in such a savage,
barbarous way. Respect the day on which the All-seeing has conferred a special holiness”.

2Ma 15:3 At this the triple-dyed scoundrel asked if there were in heaven a sovereign who had ordered the
keeping of the Sabbath day.

2Ma 15:4 When they answered, “The living Lord himself, the Heavenly Sovereign, has ordered the observance
of the seventh day”,

2Ma 15:5 he retorted, “And I, as sovereign on earth, order you to take up arms and do the king’s business”. For
all that, he did not manage to carry out his wicked plan.

2Ma 15:6 While Nicanor, in his unlimited boastfulness and pride, was planning to erect a general trophy with the
spoils taken from Judas and his men,

2Ma 15:7 Maccabaeus remained firm in his confident conviction that the Lord would stand by him.

2Ma 15:8 He urged his men not to be dismayed by the foreigners’ attacks but, keeping in mind the help that had
come to them from Heaven in the past, to be confident that this time too victory would be theirs with the help of
the Almighty.

2Ma 15:9 He put fresh heart into them by citing the Law and the Prophets and, by stirring up memories of the
battles they had already won, he filled them with new enthusiasm.

2Ma 15:10 Having thus aroused their courage, he ended his exhortation by demonstrating the treachery of the
foreigners and how they had violated their oaths.

2Ma 15:1 1 Having armed each one of them not so much with the safety given by shield and lance as with that
confidence which springs from noble language, he encouraged them all by describing to them a convincing
dream — a vision, as it were.

2Ma 15:12 What he had seen was this: Onias, the former high priest, that paragon of men, modest of bearing
and gentle of manners, suitably eloquent and trained from boyhood in the practice of every virtue — Onias was
stretching out his hands and praying for the whole Jewish community.

2Ma 15:13 Next, there appeared a man equally remarkable for his great age and dignity and invested with a
marvellous and impressive air of majesty.

2Ma 15:14 Onias began to speak: “This is a man”, he said, “who loves his brothers and prays much for the
people and the holy city-Jeremiah, the prophet of God”.

2Ma 15:15 Jeremiah then stretched out his right hand and presented Judas with a golden sword, saying as he
gave it,

2Ma 15:16 “Take this holy sword as a gift from God; with it you will shatter the enemy”.

2Ma 15:17 Encouraged by the noble words of Judas, which had the power to inspire valour and give the young
the spirit of mature men, they decided not to entrench themselves in a camp, but bravely to take the offensive
and, in hand-to-hand fighting, to commit the result to the fortune of war, since the city, their holy religion and the
Temple were in danger.

2Ma 15:18 Their concern for their wives and children, their brothers and relatives, had shrunk to minute
importance; their chief and greatest fear was for the consecrated Temple.



2Ma 15:19 Those left behind in the city felt a similar anxiety, alarmed as they were about the forthcoming
encounter in the open country.

2Ma 15:20 Everyone now awaited the coming issue. The enemy had already concentrated their forces and
stood formed up in order of battle, with the elephants drawn up in a strategic position and the cavalry disposed
on the wings.

2Ma 15:21 Maccabaeus took note of these masses confronting him, the glittering array of armour and the fierce
aspect of the elephants; then, raising his hands to heaven, he called on the Lord who works miracles, in the
knowledge that it is not by force of arms but as he sees fit to decide, that victory is granted by him to such as
deserve it.

2Ma 15:22 His prayer was worded thus: “You, Master, sent your angel in the days of Hezekiah king of Judaea,
and he destroyed no less than one hundred and eighty-five thousand of Sennacherib’s army;

2Ma 15:23 now, once again, Sovereign of heaven, send a good angel before us to spread terror and dismay.
2Ma 15:24 May these men be struck down by the might of your arm, since they have come with blasphemy on
their lips to attack your holy people”. And on these words he finished.

2Ma 15:25 Nicanor and his men advanced to the sound of trumpets and war songs,

2Ma 15:26 but the men of Judas closed with the enemy uttering invocations and prayers.

2Ma 15:27 Fighting with their hands and praying to God in their hearts, they cut down at least thirty-five
thousand men and were greatly cheered by this manifestation of God.

2Ma 15:28 When the engagement was over and they were withdrawing in triumph, they recognised Nicanor,
lying dead in full armour.

2Ma 15:29 With shouting and confusion all around, they blessed the sovereign Master in their ancestral tongue.
2Ma 15:30 He who, as protagonist, had devoted himself, body and soul, to his fellow-citizens, and had
preserved the love he felt even in youth for those of his own race, gave orders for Nicanor’s head to be cut off,
with his arm up to the shoulder, and taken to Jerusalem.

2Ma 15:31 When he arrived there himself, he called his countrymen together, stationed the priests in front of the
altar and then sent for the people from the Citadel.

2Ma 15:32 He showed them the head of the abominable Nicanor, and the hand which this infamous man had
stretched out so insolently against the holy House of the Almighty.

2Ma 1 5:33 Then, cutting out godless Nicanor’s tongue, he gave orders for it to be fed piecemeal to the birds,
and for the salary of his folly to be hung up in front of the Temple.

2Ma 15:34 At this, everyone sent blessings heavenwards to the glorious Lord, saying, “Blessed be he who has
preserved his holy place from pollution!”.

2Ma 15:35 He hung Nicanor’s head from the Citadel, a clear and evident sign to all of the help of the Lord.

2Ma 15:36 They all decreed by public vote never to let that day go by unobserved, but to celebrate the
thirteenth day of the twelfth month, called Adar in Aramaic, the eve of what is called the Day of Mordecai.

2Ma 15:37 So ends the episode of Nicanor, and as, since then, the city has remained in the possession of the
Hebrews, I shall bring my own work to an end here too.

2Ma 15:38 If it is well composed and to the point, that is just what I wanted. If it is worthless and mediocre, that
is all I could manage.

2Ma 15:39 Just as it is injurious to drink wine by itself, or again water alone, whereäs wine mixed with water is
pleasant and produces a delightful sense of well-being, so skill in presenting the incidents is what delights the
understanding of those who read the book. And here I close.






Sir 1:1 [The Law, the Prophets, and the other writers succeeding them have passed on to us great lessons, in
consequence of which Israel must be commended for learning and wisdom. Furthermore, it is a duty, not only to
acquire learning by reading, but also, once having acquired it, to make oneself of use to people outsideby what
one can say or write. My grandfather Jesus, having long devoted himself to the readingof the Law, the
Prophets and other books of the Fathersand having become very learned in them, himself decided to write
something on the subjects of learning and wisdom, so that people who wanted to learn might, by themselves
accepting these disciplines, learn how better to live according to the Law.You are therefore askedto read this
bookwith good will and attentionand to show indulgencein those places where, notwithstanding our efforts at
interpretation, we may seemto have failed to give an adequate rendering of this or that expression;the fact is that
there is no equivalentfor things originally written in Hebrew when it is a question of translating them into another
language;what is more, the Law itself, the Prophets and the other booksdiffer considerably in translation from
what appears in the original text. It was in the thirty-eighth year of the late King Euergetesthat, coming to Egypt
and spending some time here, and finding life here consistent with a high degree of wisdom, I became convinced
of an immediate duty to apply myself in my turn with pains and diligence to the translation of the book that
follows;and I spent much time and learning on itin the course of this period, to complete the work and to publish
the bookfor the benefit of those too who, domiciled abroad, wish to study, to reform their behaviour, and to live as
the Law requires.] All wisdom comes from the Lord, she is with him for ever.

Sir 1 :2 The sands of the sea, the drops of rain, the days of eternity — who can count them?

Sir 1 :3 The height of the sky, the breadth of the earth, the depth of the abyss — who can explore them?

Sir 1 :4 Wisdom was created before everything, prudent understanding subsists from remotest ages.

Sir 1:5

Sir 1 :6 For whom has the root of wisdom ever been uncovered? Her resourceful ways, who knows them?

Sir 1:7

Sir 1 :8 One only is wise, terrible indeed,

Sir 1 :9 seated on his throne, the Lord. It was he who created, inspected and weighed her up, and then poured
her out on all his works-

Sir 1:10 as much to each living creature as he chose — bestowing her on those who love him.

Sir 1:11 The fear of the Lord is glory and pride, happiness and a crown of joyfulness.

Sir 1:12 The fear of the Lord gladdens the heart, giving happiness, joy and long life.

Sir 1:13 For those who fear the Lord, all will end well: on their dying day they will be blessed.

Sir 1:14 The basis of wisdom is to fear the Lord; she was created with the faithful in their mothers’ womb;

Sir 1:15 she has made a home in the human race, an age - old foundation, and to their descendants will she
faithfully cling.

Sir 1:16 The fullness of wisdom is to fear the Lord; she intoxicates them with her fruits;

Sir 1:17 she fills their entire house with treasures and their storerooms with her produce.

Sir 1:18 The crown of wisdom is to fear the Lord: she makes peace and health flourish.

Sir 1:19 The Lord has seen and assessed her, he has showered down knowledge and intelligence, he has
exalted the renown of those who possess her.

Sir 1 :20 The root of wisdom is to fear the Lord, and her branches are long life.

Sir 1:21

Sir 1 :22 The rage of the wicked cannot put him in the right, for the weight of his rage is his downfall.

Sir 1 :23 A patient person puts up with things until the right time comes: but his joy will break out in the end.

Sir 1 :24 Till the time comes he keeps his thoughts to himself, and many a lip will affirm how wise he is.

Sir 1 :25 Wisdom’s treasuries contain the maxims of knowledge, the sinner, however, holds piety in abhorrence.



Sir 1 :26 If you desire wisdom, keep the commandments, and the Lord will bestow it on you.

Sir 1 :27 For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and instruction, and what pleases him is faithfulness and gentleness.
Sir 1 :28 Do not stand out against fear of the Lord, do not practise it with a double heart.

Sir 1 :29 Do not act a part in public, keep watch over your lips.

Sir 1 :30 Do not grow too high and mighty, for fear you fall and cover yourself in disgrace; for the Lord would
then reveal your secrets and overthrow you before the whole community for not having practised fear of the Lord
and for having a heart full of deceit.

Sir 2:1 My child, if you aspire to serve the Lord, prepare yourself for an ordeal.

Sir 2:2 Be sincere of heart, be steadfast, and do not be alarmed when disaster comes.

Sir 2:3 Cling to him and do not leave him, so that you may be honoured at the end of your days.

Sir 2:4 Whatever happens to you, accept it, and in the uncertainties of your humble state, be patient,

Sir 2:5 since gold is tested in the fire, and the chosen in the furnace of humiliation.

Sir 2:6 Trust him and he will uphold you, follow a straight path and hope in him.

Sir 2:7 You who fear the Lord, wait for his mercy; do not turn aside, for fear you fall.

Sir 2:8 You who fear the Lord, trust him, and you will not be robbed of your reward.

Sir 2:9 You who fear the Lord, hope for those good gifts of his, everlasting joy and mercy.

Sir 2:10 Look at the generations of old and see: whoëver trusted in the Lord and was put to shame? Or
whoëver, steadfastly fearing him, was forsaken? Or whoëver called to him and was ignored?

Sir 2:1 1 For the Lord is compassionate and merciful, he forgives sins and saves in the time of distress.

Sir 2:12 Woe to faint hearts and listless hands, and to the sinner who treads two paths.

Sir 2:13 Woe to the listless heart that has no faith, for such will have no protection.

Sir 2:14 Woe to you who have lost the strength to endure; what will you do at the Lord’s visitation?

Sir 2:15 Those who fear the Lord do not disdain his words, and those who love him keep his ways.

Sir 2:16 Those who fear the Lord do their best to please him, and those who love him will find satisfaction in the
Law.

Sir 2:17 Those who fear the Lord keep their hearts prepared and humble themselves in his presence.

Sir 2:18 Let us fall into the hands of the Lord, not into any human clutches; for as his majesty is, so too is his
mercy.

Sir 3:1 Children, listen to me for I am your father: do what I tell you, and so be safe;

Sir 3:2 for the Lord honours the father above his children and upholds the rights of a mother over her sons.

Sir 3:3 Whoëver respects a father expiates sins,

Sir 3:4 whoëver honours a mother is like someöne amassing a fortune.

Sir 3:5 Whoëver respects a father will in turn be happy with children, the day he prays for help, he will be heard.
Sir 3:6 Long life comes to anyone who honours a father, whoëver obeys the Lord makes a mother happy.

Sir 3:7 Such a one serves parents as well as the Lord.

Sir 3:8 Respect your father in deed as well as word, so that blessing may come on you from him;

Sir 3:9 since a father’s blessing makes his children’s house firm, while a mother’s curse tears up its foundations.
Sir 3:10 Do not make a boast of disgrace overtaking your father, your father’s disgrace reflects no honour on
you;

Sir 3:1 1 for a person’s own honour derives from the respect shown to his father, and a mother held in dishonour
is a reproach to her children.

Sir 3:12 My child, support your father in his old age, do not grieve him during his life.

Sir 3:13 Even if his mind should fail, show him sympathy, do not despise him in your health and strength;

Sir 3:14 for kindness to a father will not be forgotten but will serve as reparation for your sins.

Sir 3:15 On your own day of ordeal God will remember you: like frost in sunshine, your sins will melt away.

Sir 3:16 Whoëver deserts a father is no better than a blasphemer, and whoëver distresses a mother is accursed
of the Lord.

Sir 3:17 My child, be gentle in carrying out your business, and you will be better loved than a lavish giver.

Sir 3:18 The greater you are, the more humbly you should behave, and then you will find favour with the Lord;
Sir 3:19

Sir 3:20 for great though the power of the Lord is, he accepts the homage of the humble.

Sir 3:21 Do not try to understand things that are too difficult for you, or try to discover what is beyond your
powers.

Sir 3:22 Concentrate on what has been assigned you, you have no need to worry over mysteries.

Sir 3:23 Do not meddle with matters that are beyond you; what you have been taught already exceeds the
scope of the human mind.

Sir 3:24 For many have been misled by their own notions, wicked presumption having warped their judgement.
Sir 3:25

Sir 3:26 A stubborn heart will come to a bad end, and whoëver dallies with danger will perish in it.



Sir 3:27 A stubborn heart is weighed down with troubles, the sinner heaps sin on sin.

Sir 3:28 For the disease of the proud there is no cure, since an evil growth has taken root there.

Sir 3:29 The heart of the sensible will reflect on parables, an attentive ear is the sage’s dream.

Sir 3:30 Water puts out a blazing fire, almsgiving expiates sins.

Sir 3:31 Whoëver gives favours in return is mindful of the future; at the moment of falling, such a person will find
support.

Sir 4:1 My child, do not refuse the poor a livelihood, do not tantalise the needy.

Sir 4:2 Do not add to the sufferings of the hungry, do not bait anyone in distress.

Sir 4:3 Do not aggravate a heart already angry, nor keep the destitute waiting for your alms.

Sir 4:4 Do not repulse a hard-pressed beggar, nor turn your face from the poor.

Sir 4:5 Do not avert your eyes from the needy, give no one occasion to curse you;

Sir 4:6 for if someöne curses you in distress, his Maker will give ear to the imprecation.

Sir 4:7 Gain the love of the community, in the presence of the great bow your head.

Sir 4:8 To the poor lend an ear, and courteously return the greeting.

Sir 4:9 Save the oppressed from the hand of the oppressor, and do not be mean-spirited in your judgements.

Sir 4:10 Be like a father to the fatherless and as good as a husband to their mothers. And you will be like a child
to the Most High, who will love you more than your own mother does.

Sir 4:1 1 Wisdom brings up her own children and cares for those who seek her.

Sir 4:12 Whoëver loves her loves life, those who seek her early will be filled with joy.

Sir 4:13 Whoëver possesses her will inherit honour, and wherever he walks the Lord will bless him.

Sir 4:14 Those who serve her minister to the Holy One, and the Lord loves those who love her.

Sir 4:15 Whoëver obeys her rules the nations, whoëver pays attention to her dwells secure.

Sir 4:16 If he trusts himself to her he will inherit her, and his descendants will remain in possession of her;

Sir 4:17 for though she takes him at first through winding ways, bringing fear and faintness on him, trying him
out with her discipline till she can trust him, and testing him with her ordeals,

Sir 4:18 she then comes back to him on the straight road, makes him happy and reveals her secrets to him.

Sir 4:19 If he goes astray, however, she abandons him and leaves him to his own destruction.

Sir 4:20 Take circumstances into account and beware of evil, and have no cause to be ashamed of yourself;

Sir 4:21 for there is a shame that leads to sin and a shame that is honourable and gracious.

Sir 4:22 Do not be too severe on yourself, do not let shame lead you to ruin.

Sir 4:23 Do not refrain from speaking when it will do good, and do not hide your wisdom;

Sir 4:24 for your wisdom is made known by what you say, your erudition by the words you utter.

Sir 4:25 Do not contradict the truth, rather blush for your own ignorance.

Sir 4:26 Do not be ashamed to confess your sins, do not struggle against the current of the river.

Sir 4:27 Do not grovel to the foolish, do not show partiality to the influential.

Sir 4:28 Fight to the death for truth, and the Lord God will war on your side.

Sir 4:29 Do not be bold of tongue, yet idle and slack in deed;

Sir 4:30 do not be like a lion at home, or cowardly towards your servants.

Sir 4:31 Do not let your hands be outstretched to receive, yet tight-fisted when the time comes to give back.

Sir 5:1 Do not put your confidence in your money or say, “With this I am self-sufficient”.

Sir 5:2 Do not be led by your appetites and energy to follow the passions of your heart.

Sir 5:3 And do not say, “Who has authority over me?”. for the Lord will certainly give you your deserts.

Sir 5:4 Do not say, “I have sinned, but what harm has befallen me?”. for the Lord’s forbearance is long.

Sir 5:5 Do not be so sure of forgiveness that you add sin to sin.

Sir 5:6 And do not say, “His compassion is great, he will forgive me my many sins”; for with him are both mercy
and retribution, and his anger does not pass from sinners.

Sir 5:7 Do not delay your return to the Lord, do not put it off day after day; for suddenly the Lord’s wrath will
blaze out, and on the day of punishment you will be utterly destroyed.

Sir 5:8 Do not set your heart on ill-gotten gains, they will be of no use to you on the day of disaster.

Sir 5:9 Do not winnow in every wind, or walk along every by-way (as the double-talking sinner does).

Sir 5:10 Be steady in your convictions, and be a person of your word.

Sir 5:1 1 Be quick to listen, and deliberate in giving an answer.

Sir 5:12 If you understand the matter, give your neighbour an answer, if not, keep your hand over your mouth.
Sir 5:13 Both honour and disgrace come from talking, the tongue is its owner’s downfall.

Sir 5:14 Do not get a name for scandal-mongering, do not set traps with your tongue; for as shame lies in store
for the thief, so harsh condemnation awaits the deceitful.

Sir 5:15 Avoid offences in great as in small matters, and do not exchange friendship for enmity,

Sir 6:1 for a bad name will earn you shame and reproach, as happens to the double-talking sinner.

Sir 6:2 Do not get carried aloft on the wings of passion, for fear your strength tear itself apart like a bull,



Sir 6:3 and you devour your own foliage and destroy your own fruit and end by making yourself like a piece of
dried-up wood.

Sir 6:4 An evil temper destroys the person who has it and makes him the laughing-stock of his enemies.

Sir 6:5 A kindly turn of speech attracts new friends, a courteous tongue invites many a friendly response.

Sir 6:6 Let your acquaintances be many, but for advisers choose one out of a thousand.

Sir 6:7 If you want to make a friend, take him on trial, and do not be in a hurry to trust him;

Sir 6:8 for one kind of friend is so only when it suits him but will not stand by you in your day of trouble.

Sir 6:9 Another kind of friend will fall out with you and to your dismay make your quarrel public,

Sir 6:10 and a third kind of friend will share your table, but not stand by you in your day of trouble:

Sir 6:1 1 when you are doing well he will be your second self, ordering your servants about;

Sir 6:12 but, if disaster befalls you, he will recoil from you and keep out of your way.

Sir 6:13 Keep well clear of your enemies, and be wary of your friends.

Sir 6:14 A loyal friend is a powerful defence: whoëver finds one has indeed found a treasure.

Sir 6:15 A loyal friend is something beyond price, there is no measuring his worth.

Sir 6:16 A loyal friend is the elixir of life, and those who fear the Lord will find one.

Sir 6:17 Whoëver fears the Lord makes true friends, for as a person is, so is his friend too.

Sir 6:18 My child, from your earliest youth choose instruction, and till your hair is white you will keep finding
wisdom.

Sir 6:19 Like ploughman and sower, cultivate her and wait for her fine harvest, for in tilling her you will toil a little
while, but very soon you will be eating her crops.

Sir 6:20 How very harsh she is to the undisciplined! The senseless does not stay with her for long:

Sir 6:21 she will weigh as heavily on the senseless as a touchstone and such a person will lose no time in
throwing her off;

Sir 6:22 for Wisdom is true to her name, she is not accessible to many.

Sir 6:23 Listen, my child, and take my advice, do not reject my counsel:

Sir 6:24 put your feet into her fetters, and your neck into her collar;

Sir 6:25 offer your shoulder to her burden, do not be impatient of her bonds;

Sir 6:26 court her with all your soul, and with all your might keep in her ways;

Sir 6:27 search for her, track her down: she will reveal herself; once you hold her, do not let her go.

Sir 6:28 For in the end you will find rest in her and she will take the form of joy for you:

Sir 6:29 her fetters you will find a mighty defence, her collars, a precious necklace.

Sir 6:30 Her yoke will be a golden ornament, and her bonds be purple ribbons;

Sir 6:31 you will wear her like a robe of honour, you will put her on like a crown of joy.

Sir 6:32 If you wish it, my child, you can be taught; apply yourself, and you will become intelligent.

Sir 6:33 If you love listening, you will learn, if you pay attention, you will become wise.

Sir 6:34 Attend the gathering of elders; if there is a wise man there, attach yourself to him.

Sir 6:35 Listen willingly to any discourse coming from God, do not let wise proverbs escape you.

Sir 6:36 If you see a man of understanding, visit him early, let your feet wear out his doorstep.

Sir 6:37 Reflect on the injunctions of the Lord, busy yourself at all times with his commandments. He will
strengthen your mind, and the wisdom you desire will be granted you.

Sir 7:1 Do no evil, and evil will not befall you;

Sir 7:2 shun wrong, and it will avoid you.

Sir 7:3 My child, do not sow in the furrows of wickedness, for fear you have to reap them seven times over.

Sir 7:4 Do not ask the Lord for the highest place, or the king for a seat of honour.

Sir 7:5 Do not parade your uprightness before the Lord, or your wisdom before the king.

Sir 7:6 Do not scheme to be appointed judge, for fear you should not be strong enough to stamp out injustice,

for fear of being swayed by someöne influential and so of risking the loss of your integrity.

Sir 7:7 Do not wrong the general body of citizens and so lower yourself in popular esteem.

Sir 7:8 Do not be drawn to sin twice over, for you will not go unpunished even once.

Sir 7:9 Do not say, “God will be impressed by my numerous offerings; when I sacrifice to God Most High, he is

bound to accept”.

Sir 7:10 Do not be hesitant in prayer; do not neglect to give alms.

Sir 7:1 1 Do not laugh at someöne who is sad of heart, for he who brings low can lift up high.

Sir 7:12 Do not make up lies against your brother, nor against a friend either.

Sir 7:13 Mind you tell no lies, for no good can come of it.

Sir 7:14 Do not talk too much at the gathering of elders, and do not repeat yourself at your prayers.

Sir 7:15 Do not shirk tiring jobs or farm work, ordained by the Most High.

Sir 7:16 Do not swell the ranks of sinners, remember that the retribution will not delay.

Sir 7:17 Be very humble, since the recompense for the godless is fire and worms.



Sir 7:18 Do not barter a friend away for the sake of profit, nor a true brother for the gold of Ophir.

Sir 7:19 Do not turn against a wise and good wife; her gracious presence is worth more than gold.

Sir 7:20 Do not ill-treat a slave who is an honest worker, or a wage-earner who is devoted to you.

Sir 7:21 Love an intelligent slave with all your heart, and do not deny such a slave his freedom.

Sir 7:22 Have you cattle? Look after them; if they are making you a profit, keep them.

Sir 7:23 Have you children? Educate them, from childhood make them bow the neck.

Sir 7:24 Have you daughters? Take care of their bodies, but do not be over-indulgent.

Sir 7:25 Marry a daughter off, and you have finished a great work; but give her to a man of sense.

Sir 7:26 Have you a wife to your liking? Do not turn her out; but if you do not love her, never trust her.

Sir 7:27 With all your heart honour your father, never forget the birthpangs of your mother.

Sir 7:28 Remember that you owe your birth to them; how can you repay them for what they have done for you?
Sir 7:29 With all your soul, fear the Lord and revere his priests.

Sir 7:30 With all your might love him who made you, and do not abandon his ministers.

Sir 7:31 Fear the Lord and honour the priest and give him the portion enjoined on you: first-fruits, sacrifice of
reparation, shoulder-gift, sanctification sacrifice, first-fruits of the holy things.

Sir 7:32 And also give generously to the poor, so that your blessing may lack nothing.

Sir 7:33 Let your generosity extend to all the living, do not withhold it even from the dead.

Sir 7:34 Do not turn your back on those who weep, but share the grief of the grief-stricken.

Sir 7:35 Do not shrink from visiting the sick; in this way you will make yourself loved.

Sir 7:36 In everything you do, remember your end, and you will never sin.

Sir 8:1 Do not try conclusions with anyone influential, in case you later fall into his clutches.

Sir 8:2 Do not quarrel with anyone rich, in case he puts his weight against you; for gold has destroyed many,
and has swayed the hearts of kings.

Sir 8:3 Do not argue with anyone argumentative, do not pile wood on that fire.

Sir 8:4 Do not joke with anyone uncouth, for fear of hearing your ancestors insulted.

Sir 8:5 Do not revile a repentant sinner; remember that we all are guilty.

Sir 8:6 Do not despise anyone in old age; after all, some of us too are growing old.

Sir 8:7 Do not gloat over anyone’s death; remember that we all have to die.

Sir 8:8 Do not scorn the discourse of the wise, but make yourself familiar with their maxims, since from these
you will learn the theory and the art of serving the great.

Sir 8:9 Do not dismiss what the old people have to say, for they too were taught by their parents; from them you
will learn how to think, and the art of the timely answer.

Sir 8:10 Do not kindle the coals of the sinner, in case you scorch yourself in his blaze.

Sir 8:11 Refuse to be provoked by the insolent, for fear that such a one try to trap you in your words.

Sir 8:12 Do not lend to anyone who is stronger than you are — if you do lend, resign yourself to loss.

Sir 8:13 Do not stand surety beyond your means; if you do stand surety, be prepared to pay up.

Sir 8:14 Do not go to law with a judge, since judgement will be given in his favour.

Sir 8:15 Do not go travelling with a rash man, for fear he becomes burdensome to you; he will act as the whim
takes him, and you will both be ruined by his folly.

Sir 8:16 Do not argue with a quick-tempered man, do not go with him where there are no other people, since
blood counts for nothing in his eyes, and where no help is to be had, he will strike you down.

Sir 8:17 Do not ask a fool for advice, since a fool will not be able to keep a confidence.

Sir 8:18 In a stranger’s presence do nothing that should be kept secret, since you cannot tell what use the
stranger will make of it.

Sir 8:19 Do not open your heart to all comers, nor lay claim to their good offices.

Sir 9:1 Do not be jealous of the wife you love, do not teach her lessons in how to harm you.

Sir 9:2 Do not put yourself in a woman’s hands or she may come to dominate you completely.

Sir 9:3 Do not keep company with a prostitute, in case you get entangled in her snares.

Sir 9:4 Do not dally with a singing girl, in case you get caught by her wiles.

Sir 9:5 Do not stare at a pretty girl, in case you and she incur the same punishment.

Sir 9:6 Do not give your heart to whores, or you will ruin your inheritance.

Sir 9:7 Keep your eyes to yourself in the streets of a town, do not prowl about its unfrequented quarters.

Sir 9:8 Turn your eyes away from a handsome woman, do not stare at a beauty belonging to someöne else.
Because of a woman’s beauty, many have been undone; this makes passion flare up like a fire.

Sir 9:9 Never sit down with a married woman, or sit at table with her drinking wine, in case you let your heart
succumb to her and you lose all self-control and slide to disaster.

Sir 9:10 Do not desert an old friend; the new one will not be his match. New friend, new wine; when it grows old,
you drink it with pleasure.

Sir 9:1 1 Do not envy the sinner his success; you do not know how that will end.



Sir 9:12 Do not take pleasure in what pleases the godless; remember they will not go unpunished here below.

Sir 9:13 Keep your distance from the man who has the power to put to death, and you will not be haunted by the
fear of dying. If you do approach him, make no false move, or he may take your life. Realise that you are
treading among trip-lines, that you are strolling on the battlements.

Sir 9:14 Cultivate your neighbours to the best of your ability, and consult with the wise.

Sir 9:15 For conversation seek the intelligent, let all your discussions bear on the law of the Most High.

Sir 9:16 Have the upright for your table companions, and let your pride be in fearing the Lord.

Sir 9:17 Work from skilled hands will earn its praise, but a leader of the people must be skilful in words.

Sir 9:18 A chatterbox is a terror to his town, a loose talker is detested.

Sir 10:1 A sagacious ruler educates his people, and he makes his subjects understand order.

Sir 10:2 As the magistrate is, so will his officials be, as the governor is, so will be the inhabitants of his city.

Sir 10:3 An undisciplined king will be the ruin of his people, a city owes its prosperity to the intelligence of its
leading men.

Sir 1 0:4 The government of the earth is in the hands of the Lord, he sets the right leader over it at the right time.
Sir 10:5 Human success is in the hands of the Lord. He invests the scribe with honour.

Sir 1 0:6 Do not resent your neighbour’s every offence, and never act in a fit of passion.

Sir 10:7 Pride is hateful to God and humanity, and injustice is abhorrent to both.

Sir 10:8 Sovereignty passes from nation to nation because of injustice, arrogance and money.

Sir 1 0:9 What has dust and ashes to pride itself on? Even in life its entrails are repellent.

Sir 10:10 A long illness makes a fool of the doctor; a king today is a corpse tomorrow.

Sir 10:1 1 For in death the portion of all alike will be insects, wild animals and worms.

Sir 10:12 The first stage of pride is to desert the Lord and to turn one’s heart away from one’s Maker.

Sir 10:13 Since the first stage of pride is sin, whoëver clings to it will pour forth filth. This is why the Lord inflicts
unexpected punishments on such people, utterly destroying them.

Sir 10:14 The Lord has turned mighty princes off their thrones and seated the humble there instead.

Sir 10:15 The Lord has plucked up the proud by the roots, and planted the lowly in their place.

Sir 10:16 The Lord has overthrown the lands of the nations and destroyed them to the very foundations of the
earth.

Sir 10:17 Sometimes he has taken them away and destroyed them, and blotted out their memory from the earth.
Sir 10:18 Pride was not created for human beings, nor furious rage for those born of woman.

Sir 10:19 What race deserves honour? The human race. What race deserves honour? Those who fear the Lord.
What race deserves contempt? The human race. What race deserves contempt? Those who break the Law.

Sir 1 0:20 A leader is honoured by his brothers, and those who fear the Lord are honoured by him.

Sir 10:21

Sir 10:22 The rich, the noble, the poor, let them pride themselves on fearing the Lord.

Sir 1 0:23 It is not right to despise one who is poor but intelligent, and it is not good to honour one who is a
sinner.

Sir 10:24 Magnate, magistrate, potentate, all are to be honoured, but none is greater than the one who fears the
Lord.

Sir 10:25 A wise slave will have free men waiting on him, and the enlightened will not complain.

Sir 1 0:26 Do not try to be smart when you do your work, do not put on airs when you are in difficulties.

Sir 10:27 Better the hardworking who has plenty of everything, than the pretentious at a loss for a meal.

Sir 1 0:28 My child, be modest in your self-esteem, and value yourself at your proper worth.

Sir 1 0:29 Who can justify one who inflicts injuries on himself, or respect one who is full of self-contempt?

Sir 1 0:30 The poor is honoured for wit, and the rich for wealth.

Sir 10:31 Honoured in poverty, how much the more in wealth! Dishonoured in wealth, how much the more in
poverty!

Sir 11:1 Wisdom enables the poor to stand erect, and gives to the poor a place with the great.

Sir 1 1 :2 Do not praise anyone for good looks, nor dislike anyone for mere appearance.

Sir 1 1 :3 Small among winged creatures is the bee but her produce is the sweetest of the sweet.

Sir 1 1 :4 Do not grow proud when people honour you; for the works of the Lord are wonderful but hidden from
human beings.

Sir 1 1 :5 Many monarchs have been made to sit on the ground, and the person nobody thought of has worn the
crown.

Sir 1 1 :6 Many influential people have been utterly disgraced, and prominent people have fallen into the power of
others.

Sir 11:7 Do not find fault before making thorough enquiry; first reflect, then give a reprimand.

Sir 1 1 :8 Listen before you answer, and do not interrupt a speech before it is finished.

Sir 11:9 Do not wrangle about something that does not concern you, do not interfere in the quarrels of sinners.



Sir 11:10 My child, do not take on a great amount of business; if you multiply your interests, you are bound to
suffer for it; hurry as fast as you can, yet you will never arrive, nor will you escape by running away.

Sir 11:11 Some people work very hard at top speed, only to find themselves falling further behind.

Sir 11:12 Or there is the slow kind of person, needing help, poor in possessions and rich in poverty; and the
Lord turns a favourable eye on him, lifts him out of his wretched condition,

Sir 11:13 and enables him to hold his head high, thus causing general astonishment.

Sir 11:14 Good and bad, life and death, poverty and wealth, all come from the Lord.

Sir 11:15
Sir 11:16

Sir 11:17 To the devout the Lord’s gift remains constant, and his favour will be there to lead them for ever.

Sir 11:18 Others grow rich by pinching and scraping, and here is the reward they receive for it:

Sir 1 1:19 although they say, “Now I can sit back and enjoy the benefit of what I have got”, they do not know how
long this will last; they will have to leave their goods to others and die.

Sir 1 1 :20 Stick to your job, work hard at it and grow old at your work.

Sir 1 1 :21 Do not admire the achievements of sinners, trust the Lord and mind your own business; since it is a
trifle in the eyes of the Lord, in a moment, suddenly to make the poor rich.

Sir 1 1 :22 The blessing of the Lord is the reward of the devout, in a moment God brings his blessing to flower.

Sir 1 1 :23 Do not say, “What are my needs, how much shall I have in the future?”.

Sir 1 1 :24 And do not say, “I am self-sufficient, what disaster can affect me now?”.

Sir 1 1 :25 In prosperous times, disasters are forgotten and in times of disaster, no one remembers prosperity.

Sir 1 1 :26 Yet it is a trifle for the Lord on the day someöne dies to repay him as his conduct deserves.

Sir 1 1:27 A moment’s adversity, and pleasures are forgotten; in a person’s last hour his deeds will stand
revealed.

Sir 1 1 :28 Call no one fortunate before his death; it is by his end that someöne will be known.

Sir 1 1 :29 Do not bring everyone home with you, for many are the traps of the crafty.

Sir 1 1 :30 Like a captive partridge in a cage, so is the heart of the proud: like a spy he watches for your downfall,
Sir 1 1 :31 ever on the look-out, turning good into bad and finding fault with what is praiseworthy.

Sir 1 1 :32 A hearthful of glowing coals starts from a single spark, and the sinner lurks for the chance to spill
blood.

Sir 1 1 :33 Beware of a scoundrel and his evil contrivances, in case he puts a smear on you for ever.

Sir 1 1 :34 Give a home to a stranger and he will start trouble and estrange you from your own family.

Sir 12:1 If you mean to do a kindness, choose the right person, then your good deeds will not be wasted.

Sir 12:2 Do good to someöne devout, and you will be rewarded, if not by that person, then certainly by the Most
High.

Sir 12:3 No good will come to one who persists in evil, or who refuses to give alms.

Sir 12:4 Give to the devout, do not go to the help of a sinner.

Sir 12:5 Do good to the humble, give nothing to the godless. Refuse him bread, do not give him any, it might
make him stronger than you are; then you would be repaid evil twice over for all the good you had done him.

Sir 1 2:6 For the Most High himself detests sinners, and will repay the wicked with what they deserve.

Sir 12:7 Give to the good, and do not go to the help of a sinner.

Sir 12:8 In prosperity you cannot always tell a true friend, but in adversity you cannot mistake an enemy.

Sir 12:9 When someöne is doing well that person’s enemies are sad, when someöne is doing badly, even a
friend will keep at a distance.

Sir 12:10 Do not ever trust an enemy; as bronze tarnishes, so does an enemy’s malice.

Sir 12:1 1 Even if he behaves humbly and comes bowing and scraping, maintain your reserve and be on your

guard against him. Behave towards him as if you were polishing a mirror, you will find that his tarnish cannot last.
Sir 12:12 Do not stand him beside you in case he thrusts you out and takes your place. Do not seat him on your
right, or he will be after your position, and then you will remember what I have said and sadly admit that I was
right.

Sir 12:13 Who feels sorry for a snake-charmer bitten by a snake, or for those who take risks with savage
animals? -

Sir 12:14 just so for one who consorts with a sinner, and becomes an accomplice in his sins.

Sir 12:15 He will stay with you for a while, but if you once give way he will press his advantage.

Sir 12:16 An enemy may have sweetness on his lips, and in his heart a scheme to throw you into the ditch. An

enemy may have tears in his eyes, but if he gets a chance there can never be too much blood for him.

Sir 12:17 If you meet with misfortune, you will find him there before you, and, pretending to help you, he will trip
you up.

Sir 12:18 He will wag his head and clap his hands, he will whisper a lot and his expression will change.

Sir 13:1 Whoëver touches pitch will be defiled, and anyone who associates with the proud will come to be like



them.

Sir 13:2 Do not try to carry a burden too heavy for you, do not associate with someöne more powerful and
wealthy than yourself. Why put the clay pot next to the iron cauldron? It will only break when they bang against
each other.

Sir 13:3 The rich does wrong and takes a high line; the poor is wronged and has to beg for pardon.

Sir 1 3:4 If you are useful the rich will exploit you, if you go bankrupt he will desert you.

Sir 13:5 Are you well off? - he will live with you, he will clean you out without a single qualm.

Sir 13:6 Does he need you? - he will hoodwink you, smile at you and raise your hopes; he will speak politely to
you and say, “Is there anything you need?”.

Sir 1 3:7 He will make you feel small at his dinner parties and, having cleaned you out two or three times over,
will end by laughing at you. Afterwards, when he sees you, he will avoid you and shake his head about you.

Sir 13:8 Take care you are not hoodwinked and thus humiliated through your own stupidity.

Sir 13:9 When an influential person invites you, show reluctance, and he will press his invitation all the more.

Sir 13:10 Do not thrust yourself forward, in case you are pushed aside, but do not stand aloof, or you will be
overlooked.

Sir 13:1 1 Do not affect to treat him as an equal, do not trust his flow of words; since all this talking is expressly
meant to test you, under cover of geniality he will be weighing you up.

Sir 13:12 Pitiless is anyone who retails gossip; he will not spare you either blows or chains.

Sir 13:13 Be wary, take very great care, because you are walking with your own downfall.

Sir 13:14

Sir 13:15 Every living thing loves its own sort, and every man his fellow.

Sir 13:16 Every creature mixes with its kind, and human beings stick to their own sort.

Sir 13:17 How can wolf and lamb agree? - Just so with sinner and devout.

Sir 13:18 What peace can there be between hyena and dog? And what peace between rich and poor?

Sir 13:19 Wild desert donkeys are the prey of lions; so too, the poor is the quarry of the rich.

Sir 13:20 The proud thinks humility abhorrent; so too, the rich abominates the poor.

Sir 13:21 When the rich stumbles he is supported by friends; when the poor falls, his friends push him away.

Sir 13:22 When the rich slips, there are many hands to catch him, if he talks nonsense he is congratulated. The
poor slips, and is blamed for it, he may talk good sense, but no room is made for him.

Sir 13:23 The rich speaks and everyone stops talking, and then they praise his discourse to the skies. The poor
speaks and people say, “Who is this?”. and if he stumbles, they trip him up yet more.

Sir 13:24 Wealth is good where there is no sin, poverty is evil, the godless say.

Sir 1 3:25 The heart moulds a person’s expression whether for better or worse.

Sir 13:26 Happy heart, cheerful expression; but wearisome work, inventing proverbs.

Sir 14:1 Blessed is anyone who has not sinned in speech and who needs feel no remorse for sins.

Sir 14:2 Blessed is anyone whose conscience brings no reproach and who has never given up hope.

Sir 14:3 Wealth is not the right thing for the niggardly, and what use are possessions to the covetous?

Sir 14:4 Whoëver hoards by stinting himself is hoarding for others, and others will live sumptuously on his
riches.

Sir 14:5 If someöne is mean to himself, whom does he benefit? he does not even enjoy what is his own.

Sir 14:6 No one is meaner than the person who is mean to himself, this is how his wickedness repays him.

Sir 14:7 If he does any good, he does it unintentionally, and in the end he himself reveals his wickedness.

Sir 14:8 Wicked the person who has an envious eye, averting his face, and careless of others’ lives.

Sir 1 4:9 The eye of the grasping is not content with what he has, greed shrivels up the soul.

Sir 14:10 The miser is grudging of bread, there is famine at his table.

Sir 14:1 1 My child, treat yourself as well as you can afford, and bring worthy offerings to the Lord.

Sir 14:12 Remember that death will not delay, and that you have never seen Sheol’s contract.

Sir 14:13 Be kind to your friend before you die, treat him as generously as you can afford.

Sir 14:14 Do not refuse yourself the good things of today, do not let your share of what is lawfully desired pass
you by.

Sir 14:15 Will you not have to leave your fortune to another, and the fruit of your labour to be divided by lot?

Sir 14:16 Give and receive, enjoy yourself — there are no pleasures to be found in Sheol.

Sir 14:17 Like clothes, every body will wear out, the age — old law is, “Everyone must die”.

Sir 14:18 Like foliage growing on a bushy tree, some leaves falling, others growing, so are the generations of
flesh and blood: one dies, another is born.

Sir 14:19 Every achievement rots away and perishes, and with it goes its author.

Sir 14:20 Blessed is anyone who meditates on wisdom, and reasons with intelligence,

Sir 14:21 who studies her ways in his heart, and ponders her secrets.

Sir 14:22 He pursues her like a hunter, and lies in wait by her path;



Sir 14:23 he peeps in at her windows, and listens at her doors;

Sir 14:24 he lodges close to her house, and fixes his peg in her walls;

Sir 14:25 he pitches his tent at her side, and lodges in an excellent lodging;

Sir 14:26 he sets his children in her shade, and camps beneath her branches;

Sir 14:27 he is sheltered by her from the heat, and in her glory he makes his home.

Sir 15:1 Whoëver fears the Lord will act like this, and whoëver grasps the Law will obtain wisdom.

Sir 15:2 She will come to meet him like a mother, and receive him like a virgin bride.

Sir 15:3 She will give him the bread of understanding to eat, and the water of wisdom to drink.

Sir 15:4 He will lean on her and will not fall, he will rely on her and not be put to shame.

Sir 15:5 She will raise him high above his neighbours, and in full assembly she will open his mouth.

Sir 15:6 He will find happiness and a crown of joy, he will inherit an everlasting name.

Sir 1 5:7 Fools will not gain possession of her, nor will sinners set eyes on her.

Sir 1 5:8 She stands remote from pride, and liars cannot call her to mind.

Sir 15:9 Praise is unseemly in a sinner’s mouth, since it has not been put there by the Lord.

Sir 15:10 For praise should be uttered only in wisdom, and the Lord himself then prompts it.

Sir 15:1 1 Do not say, “The Lord was responsible for my sinning”, for he does not do what he hates.

Sir 15:12 Do not say, “It was he who led me astray”, for he has no use for a sinner.

Sir 15:13 The Lord hates all that is foul, and no one who fears him will love it either.

Sir 15:14 He himself made human beings in the beginning, and then left them free to make their own decisions.
Sir 15:15 If you choose, you will keep the commandments and so be faithful to his will.

Sir 15:16 He has set fire and water before you; put out your hand to whichever you prefer.

Sir 15:17 A human being has life and death before him; whichever he prefers will be given him.

Sir 15:18 For vast is the wisdom of the Lord; he is almighty and all-seeing.

Sir 15:19 His eyes are on those who fear him, he notes every human action.

Sir 15:20 He never commanded anyone to be godless, he has given no one permission to sin.

Sir 16:1 Do not long fora brood of worthless children, and do not take pleasure in godless sons.

Sir 1 6:2 However many you have, take no pleasure in them, unless the fear of the Lord lives among them.

Sir 16:3 Do not count on their having long life, do not put too much faith in their number; for better have one
than a thousand, better die childless than have children who are godless.

Sir 1 6:4 One person of sense can populate a city, but a race of lawless people will be destroyed.

Sir 16:5 My eyes have seen many such things, my ears have heard things even more impressive.

Sir 16:6 Fire is kindled in a sinful society, Retribution blazes in a rebellious nation.

Sir 1 6:7 God did not pardon the giants of old who, confident in their strength, had rebelled.

Sir 16:8 He did not spare the people with whom Lot lived; he abhorred them, rather, for their pride.

Sir 16:9 He was pitiless to the nation of perdition — those people who gloried in their sins-

Sir 16:10 as also to the six hundred thousand men on the march, who had banded together in their obstinacy.

Sir 16:1 1 And had there been only one man stubborn, it would have been amazing had he escaped unpunished,
since mercy and wrath alike belong to the Lord who is mighty to forgive and to pour out wrath.

Sir 16:12 As great as his mercy, so is his severity; he judges each person as his deeds deserve:

Sir 16:13 the sinner will not escape with his ill-gotten gains nor the patience of the devout go for nothing.

Sir 16:14 He takes note of every charitable action, and everyone is treated as he deserves.

Sir 16:15
Sir 16:16

Sir 16:17 Do not say, “I shall hide from the Lord; who is going to remember me up there? I shall not be noticed
among so many people; what am I in the immensity of creation?”.

Sir 16:18 For see, the sky and the heavens above the sky, the abyss and the earth shake at his visitation.

Sir 16:19 The mountains and earth’s foundations alike quail and tremble when he looks at them.

Sir 16:20 But to all this no one gives thought. Who keeps his movements in mind?

Sir 16:21 The storm wind itself is invisible, and most of what he does goes undetected.

Sir 16:22 “Who will report whether justice has been done? Who will be watching? The covenant is remote!”.

Sir 1 6:23 Such are the thoughts of the person of little sense, stupid, misguided, cherishing his folly.

Sir 16:24 Listen to me, my child, and learn knowledge, and give your whole mind to my words.

Sir 16:25 I shall expound discipline methodically and proclaim knowledge with precision.

Sir 16:26 When God created his works in the beginning, he assigned them their places as soon as they were
made.

Sir 16:27 He determined his works for all time, from their origins to their distant generations. They know neither
hunger nor weariness, and they never desert their duties.

Sir 1 6:28 Not one has ever got in the way of another, and they will never disobey his word.

Sir 16:29 And afterwards the Lord looked at the earth, and filled it with his good things.



Sir 1 6:30 He covered its surface with every kind of animal, and to it they will return.

Sir 17:1 The Lord fashioned human beings from the earth, to consign them back to it.

Sir 17:2 He gave them so many days and so much time, he gave them authority over everything on earth.

Sir 17:3 He clothed them in strength, like himself, and made them in his own image.

Sir 17:4 He filled all living things with dread of human beings, making them masters over beasts and birds.

Sir 17:5

Sir 17:6 He made them a tongue, eyes and ears, and gave them a heart to think with.

Sir 17:7 He filled them with knowledge and intelligence, and showed them what was good and what evil.

Sir 17:8 He put his own light in their hearts to show them the magnificence of his works,

Sir 17:9

Sir 17:10 so that they would praise his holy name as they told of his magnificent works.

Sir 17:1 1 He set knowledge before them, he endowed them with the law of life.

Sir 17:12 He established an eternal covenant with them, and revealed his judgements to them.

Sir 17:13 Their eyes saw the majesty of his glory, and their ears heard the glory of his voice.

Sir 17:14 He said to them, “Beware of all wrong-doing”; he gave each a commandment concerning his
neighbour.

Sir 17:15 Their ways are always under his eye, they cannot be hidden from his sight.

Sir 17:16

Sir 17:17 Over each nation he has set a governor, but Israel is the Lord’s own portion.

Sir 17:18

Sir 17:19 Their actions are all as plain as the sun to him, and his eyes rest constantly on their conduct.

Sir 17:20 Their iniquities are not hidden from him, all their sins are before the Lord.

Sir 17:21

Sir 17:22 Almsgiving is like a signet ring to him, he cherishes generosity like the pupil of an eye.

Sir 17:23 One day he will rise and reward them, he will repay their deserts on their own heads.

Sir 17:24 But to those who repent he permits return, and he encourages those who have lost hope.

Sir 17:25 Return to the Lord and renounce your sins, plead before his face, stop offending him.

Sir 17:26 Come back to the Most High, turn away from iniquity and hold all that is foul in abhorrence.

Sir 17:27 Who is going to praise the Most High in Sheol if we do not glorify him while we are alive?

Sir 17:28 The dead can praise no more than those who do not exist, only those with life and health can praise
the Lord.

Sir 17:29 How great is the mercy of the Lord, his pardon for those who turn to him!

Sir 17:30 For we cannot have everything, human beings are not immortal.

Sir 17:31 What is brighter than the sun? And yet it fades. Flesh and blood think of nothing but evil.

Sir 17:32 He surveys the armies of the lofty sky, and all of us are only dust and ashes.

Sir 18:1 He who lives for ever has created the sum of things.

Sir 18:2 The Lord alone will be found just.

Sir 18:3

Sir 18:4 He has given no one the power to proclaim his works to the end, and who can fathom his magnificent
deeds?

Sir 18:5 Who can assess his magnificent strength, and who can go further and tell all of his mercies?

Sir 18:6 Nothing can be added to them, nothing subtracted, it is impossible to fathom the marvels of the Lord.

Sir 18:7 When someöne finishes he is only beginning, and when he stops he is as puzzled as ever.

Sir 18:8 What is a human being, what purpose does he serve? What is good and what is bad for him?

Sir 18:9 The length of his life: a hundred years at most.

Sir 18:10 Like a drop of water from the sea, or a grain of sand, such are these few years compared with eternity.
Sir 18:1 1 This is why the Lord is patient with them and pours out his mercy on them.

Sir 18:12 He sees and recognises how wretched their end is, and so he makes his forgiveness the greater.

Sir 18:13 Human compassion extends to neighbours, but the Lord’s compassion extends to everyone; rebuking,
correcting and teaching, bringing them back as a shepherd brings his flock.

Sir 18:14 He has compassion on those who accept correction, and who fervently search for his judgements.

Sir 18:15 My child, do not temper your favours with blame nor any of your gifts with words that hurt.

Sir 18:16 Does not dew relieve the heat? In the same way a word is worth more than a gift.

Sir 18:17 Why surely, a word is better than a good present, but a generous person is ready with both.

Sir 18:18 A fool will offer nothing but insult, and a grudging gift makes the eyes smart.

Sir 18:19 Learn before you speak, take care of yourself before you fall ill.

Sir 1 8:20 Examine yourself before judgement comes, and on the day of visitation you will be acquitted.

Sir 18:21 Humble yourself before you fall ill, repent as soon as the sin is committed.

Sir 18:22 Let nothing prevent your discharging a vow in good time, and do not wait till death to set matters right.



Sir 18:23 Prepare yourself before making a vow, and do not be like someöne who tempts the Lord.

Sir 18:24 Bear in mind the retribution of the last days, the time of vengeance when God averts his face.

Sir 1 8:25 In a time of plenty remember times of famine, think of poverty and want when you are rich.

Sir 1 8:26 The time slips by between dawn and dusk, everything passes quickly for the Lord.

Sir 18:27 The wise will be cautious in everything, in sinful times will take care not to offend.

Sir 18:28 Every person of sense recognises wisdom, and will respect anyone who has found her.

Sir 18:29 Those who understand sayings have toiled for their wisdom and have poured out accurate maxims.

Sir 18:30 Do not be governed by your passions, restrain your desires.

Sir 1 8:31 If you allow yourself to satisfy your desires, this will make you the laughing-stock of your enemies.

Sir 18:32 Do not indulge in luxurious living, do not get involved in such society.

Sir 18:33 Do not beggar yourself by banqueting on credit when there is nothing in your pocket.

Sir 19:1 A drunken workman will never grow rich, and one who makes light of small matters will gradually sink.
Sir 19:2 Wine and women corrupt intelligent men, the customer of whores loses all sense of shame.

Sir 19:3 Grubs and worms will have him as their legacy, and the man who knows no shame will lose his life.

Sir 19:4 Being too ready to trust shows shallowness of mind, and sinning harms the sinner.

Sir 19:5 Taking pleasure in evil earns condemnation;

Sir 19:6 by hating gossip one avoids evil.

Sir 19:7 Never repeat what you are told and you will come to no harm;

Sir 1 9:8 whether to friend or foe, do not talk about it, unless it would be sinful not to, do not reveal it;

Sir 19:9 you would be heard out, then mistrusted, and in due course you would be hated.

Sir 19:10 Have you heard something? Let it die with you. Courage! It will not burst you!

Sir 19:1 1 A fool will suffer birthpangs over a piece of news, like a woman labouring with child.

Sir 19:12 Like an arrow stuck in the flesh of the thigh, so is a piece of news inside a fool.

Sir 19:13 Question your friend, he may have done nothing at all; and if he has done anything, he will not do it
again.

Sir 19:14 Question your neighbour, he may have said nothing at all; and if he has said anything, he will not say
it again.

Sir 19:15 Question your friend, for slander is very common, do not believe all you hear.

Sir 19:16 People sometimes make a slip, without meaning what they say; and which of us has never sinned by
speech?

Sir 19:17 Question your neighbour before you threaten him, and defer to the Law of the Most High.

Sir 19:18
Sir 19:19

Sir 19:20 Wisdom consists entirely in fearing the Lord, and wisdom is entirely constituted by the fulfilling of the
Law.

Sir 19:21

Sir 19:22 Being learned in evil, however, is not wisdom, there is no prudence in the advice of sinners.

Sir 19:23 There is a cleverness that is detestable; whoëver has no wisdom is a fool.

Sir 1 9:24 Better be short of sense and full of fear, than abound in shrewdness and violate the Law.

Sir 19:25 There is a wickedness which is scrupulous but nonetheless dishonest, and there are those who
misuse kindness to win their case.

Sir 19:26 There is the person who will walk bowed down with grief, when inwardly this is nothing but deceit:

Sir 19:27 he hides his face and pretends to be deaf, if he is not unmasked, he will take advantage of you.

Sir 19:28 There is the person who is prevented from sinning by lack of strength, yet he will do wrong when he
gets the chance.

Sir 19:29 You can tell a person by his appearance, you can tell a thinker by the look on his face.

Sir 19:30 The way a person dresses, the way he laughs, the way he walks, tell you what he is.

Sir 20:1 There is the rebuke that is untimely, and there is the person who keeps quiet, and he is the shrewd one.
Sir 20:2 But how much better to rebuke than to fume!

Sir 20:3 The person who acknowledges a fault wards off punishment.

Sir 20:4 Like a eunuch trying to take a girl’s virginity is someöne who tries to impose justice by force.

Sir 20:5 There is the person who keeps quiet and is considered wise, another incurs hatred for talking too much.
Sir 20:6 There is the person who keeps quiet, not knowing how to answer, another keeps quiet, knowing when
to speak.

Sir 20:7 The wise will keep quiet till the right moment, but a garrulous fool will always misjudge it.

Sir 20:8 Someöne who talks too much will earn dislike, and someöne who usurps authority will earn hatred.

Sir 20:9 There is the person who finds misfortune a boon, and the piece of luck that turns to loss.

Sir 20:10 There is the gift that affords you no profit, and the gift that repays you double.

Sir 20:1 1 There is the honour that leads to humiliation, and there are people in a low state who raise their



heads.

Sir 20:12 There is the person who buys much for little, yet pays for it seven times over.

Sir 20:13 The wise wins love with words, while fools may shower favours in vain.

Sir 20:14 The gift of the stupid will bring you no advantage, his eyes look for seven times as much in return.

Sir 20:15 He gives little and reviles much, he opens his mouth like the town crier, he lends today and demands
payment tomorrow; he is a detestable fellow.

Sir 20:16 The fool will say, “I have no friends, I get no gratitude for my good deeds;

Sir 20:17 those who eat my bread have malicious tongues”. How often he will be laughed at, and by how many!
Sir 20:18 Better a slip on the pavement than a slip of the tongue; this is how ruin takes the wicked by surprise.
Sir 20:19 A coarse-grained person is like an indiscreet story endlessly retold by the ignorant.

Sir 20:20 A maxim is rejected when coming from a fool, since the fool does not utter it on the apt occasion.

Sir 20:21 There is a person who is prevented from sinning by poverty; no qualms of conscience disturb that
person’s rest.

Sir 20:22 There is a person who courts destruction out of false shame, courts destruction for the sake of a fool’s
opinion.

Sir 20:23 There is a person who out of false shame makes promises to a friend, and so makes an enemy for
nothing.

Sir 20:24 Lying is an ugly blot on anyone, and ever on the lips of the undisciplined.

Sir 20:25 A thief is preferable to an inveterate liar, but both are heading for ruin.

Sir 20:26 Lying is an abominable habit, the liar’s disgrace lasts for ever.

Sir 20:27 The wise gains advancement by words, the shrewd wins favour from the great.

Sir 20:28 Whoëver tills the soil will have a full harvest, whoëver wins favour from the great will secure pardon for
offences.

Sir 20:29 Presents and gifts blind the eyes of the wise and stifle rebukes like a muzzle on the mouth.

Sir 20:30 Wisdom concealed, and treasure undiscovered, what use is either of these?

Sir 20:31 Better one who conceals his folly than one who conceals his wisdom.

Sir 21:1 My child, have you sinned? Do so no more, and ask forgiveness for your previous faults.

Sir 21 :2 Flee from sin as from a snake, if you approach it, it will bite you; its teeth are lion’s teeth, they take
human life away.

Sir 21 :3 All law-breaking is like a two-edged sword, the wounds it inflicts are beyond cure.

Sir 21 :4 Terror and violence make havoc of riches, similarly, desolation overtakes the houses of the proud.

Sir 21 :5 A plea from the mouth of the poor goes straight to the ear of God, whose judgement comes without
delay.

Sir 21 :6 Whoëver resents reproof walks in the sinner’s footsteps; whoëver fears the Lord is repentant of heart.
Sir 21 :7 The glib speaker is known far and wide, but the wary detects every slip.

Sir 21 :8 To build your house with other people’s money is like collecting stones for your own tomb.

Sir 21 :9 A meeting of the lawless is like a heap of tow: they will end in a blazing fire.

Sir 21:10 The sinner’s road is smoothly paved, but it ends at the pit of Sheol.

Sir 21:11 Whoëver keeps the Law will master his instincts; the fear of the Lord is made perfect in wisdom.

Sir 21:12 No one who lacks aptitude can be taught, but certain aptitudes give rise to bitterness.

Sir 21:1 3 The sage’s knowledge is as rich as the abyss and his advice is like a living spring.

Sir 21:14 The heart of a fool is like a broken jar, it will not hold any knowledge.

Sir 21:1 5 If the educated hears a wise saying, he praises it and caps it with another; if a debauchee hears it, he
does not like it and tosses it behind his back.

Sir 21:16 The talk of a fool is like a load on a journey, but it is a pleasure to listen to the intelligent.

Sir 21:1 7 The utterance of the shrewd will be eagerly awaited in the assembly, what he says will be given
serious consideration.

Sir 21:18 The wisdom of a fool is like the wreckage of a house, the knowledge of a dolt is incoherent talk.

Sir 21:19 To the senseless fellow instruction is like fetters on the feet, like manacles on the right hand.

Sir 21 :20 A fool laughs at the top of his voice, but the intelligent quietly smiles.

Sir 21 :21 To the shrewd instruction is like a golden ornament, like a bracelet on the right arm.

Sir 21 :22 The step of a fool goes straight into a house, but a person of much experience makes a respectful
approach;

Sir 21 :23 the stupid peeps inside through the door, a well-bred person waits outside.

Sir 21 :24 Listening at doors is a sign of bad upbringing, the perceptive would be ashamed to do so.

Sir 21 :25 The lips of gossips repeat the words of others, the words of the wise are carefully weighed.

Sir 21 :26 The heart of fools is in their mouth, but the mouth of the wise is in their heart.

Sir 21 :27 When the godless curses Satan, he is cursing himself.

Sir 21 :28 The scandal-monger sullies himself and earns the hatred of the neighbourhood.



Sir 22:1 An idler is like a stone covered in filth, everyone whistles at his disgrace.

Sir 22:2 An idler is like a lump of dung, anyone picking it up shakes it off his hand.

Sir 22:3 It is a disgrace to have fathered a badly brought-up son, but the birth of any daughter is a loss;

Sir 22:4 a sensible daughter will find a husband, but a shameless one is a grief to her father.

Sir 22:5 A brazen daughter puts father and mother to shame, and will be disowned by both.

Sir 22:6 An untimely remonstrance is like music at a funeral, but a thrashing and correction are wisdom at all
times.

Sir 22:7
Sir 22:8

Sir 22:9 Teaching a fool is like gluing bits of pottery together — you are rousing someöne who is besotted with
sleep.

Sir 22:10 You might as well talk to someöne sound asleep; when you have finished the fool will say, “What’s
up?”.

Sir 22:1 1 Shed tears for the dead, who has left the light behind; shed tears for the fool, who has left his wits
behind. Shed quieter tears for the dead who is at rest, for the fool life is worse than death.

Sir 22:12 Mourning for the dead lasts seven days, for the foolish and ungodly all the days of their lives.

Sir 22:13 Do not waste many words on the stupid, do not go near a dolt. Beware of him, or you will have trouble
and be soiled by contact with him; keep away from him, and you will have peace of mind and not be exasperated
by his folly.

Sir 22:14 What is heavier than lead, and what is its name if not “fool'?

Sir 22:15 Sand and salt and a lump of iron are a lighter burden than a dolt.

Sir 22:16 A tie-beam bonded into a building will not be dislodged by an earthquake; so too, a heart resolved
after due reflection will not flinch at the critical moment.

Sir 22:17 A heart founded on intelligent reflection is like a stucco decoration on a smooth wall.

Sir 22:18 Pebbles placed on top of a wall will not stand up to the wind; no more can the heart of a fool frightened

at his own thoughts stand up to fear.

Sir 22:19 Prick an eye and you will draw a tear, prick a heart and you reveal its feelings.

Sir 22:20 Throw stones at birds and you scare them away, reproach a friend and you destroy a friendship.

Sir 22:21 If you have drawn your sword on a friend, do not despair; there is a way back.

Sir 22:22 If you have opened your mouth against your friend, do not worry; there is hope for reconciliation; but
insult, arrogance, betrayal of secrets, and the stab in the back — in these cases any friend is lost.

Sir 22:23 Win your neighbour’s confidence when he is poor, so that you may enjoy his later good fortune with
him; stand by him in times of trouble, in order to have your share when he comes into a legacy.

Sir 22:24 Fire is heralded by the reek of the furnace and smoke, so too, bloodshed by insults.

Sir 22:25 I shall not be ashamed to shelter a friend nor shall I hide away from him,

Sir 22:26 and if evil comes to me through him, everyone who hears about it will beware of him.

Sir 22:27 Who will set a guard on my mouth, and an efficient seal on my lips, to keep me from falling, and my
tongue from causing my ruin?

Sir 23:1 Lord, father and master of my life, do not abandon me to their whims, do not let me fall because of
them.

Sir 23:2 Who will lay whips to my thoughts, and the discipline of wisdom to my heart, to be merciless to my
errors and not let my sins go unchecked,

Sir 23:3 for fear my errors should multiply and my sins then abound and I fall before my adversaries, and my
enemy gloat over me?

Sir 23:4 Lord, father and God of my life, do not let my eyes be proud,

Sir 23:5 turn envy away from me,

Sir 23:6 do not let lechery and lust grip me, do not leave me a prey to shameless desire.

Sir 23:7 Children, listen to what I teach, no one who keeps it will be caught out.

Sir 23:8 The sinner is ensnared by his own lips, both the abusive and the proud are tripped by them.

Sir 23:9 Do not get into the habit of swearing, do not make a habit of naming the Holy One;

Sir 23:10 for just as a slave who is constantly overseen will never be without bruises, so someöne who is always
swearing and uttering the Name will not be exempt from sin.

Sir 23:1 1 A man for ever swearing is full of iniquity, and the scourge will not depart from his house. If he offends,
his sin will be on him, if he did it unheedingly, he has doubly sinned; if he swears a false oath, he will not be
treated as innocent, for his house will be filled with calamities.

Sir 23:12 One way of talking is like death, let it not be found in the heritage of Jacob since devout people have
nothing to do with that: they will not wallow in sin.

Sir 23:13 Do not get into the habit of using coarse and foul language since this involves sinful words.

Sir 23:14 Remember your father and mother when you are sitting with the great, for fear you forget yourself in



their presence and behave like a fool, and then wish you had not been born and curse the day of your birth.

Sir 23:15 No one in the habit of using shameful language will break himself of it as long as he lives.

Sir 23:16 There are two types of people who commit sin after sin and a third who attracts retribution-
Sir 23:17 desire, blazing like a furnace, will not die down until it has been sated- the man who lusts after
members of his own family is not going to stop until he is quite burnt out; every food is sweet to the promiscuous,
and he will not desist until he dies;

Sir 23:18 and the man who sins against the marriage bed and says to himself, “Who can see me? There is
darkness all round me, the walls hide me, no one can see me, why should I worry? The Most High will not
remember my sins”.

Sir 23:19 What he fears are human eyes, he does not realise that the eyes of the Lord are ten thousand times
brighter than the sun, observing every aspect of human behaviour, seeing into the most secret corners.

Sir 23:20 All things were known to him before they were created, and are still, now that they are finished.

Sir 23:21 This man will be punished in view of the whole town, and will be seized when he least expects it.

Sir 23:22 Similarly the woman unfaithful to her husband, who provides him with an heir by another man:

Sir 23:23 first, she has disobeyed the Law of the Most High; secondly, she has been false to her husband; and
thirdly, she has gone whoring in adultery

Sir 23:24 and conceived children by another man. She will be led before the assembly, an enquiry will be held
about her children.

Sir 23:25 Her children will strike no root, her branches will bear no fruit.

Sir 23:26 She will leave an accursed memory behind her, her shame will never be wiped out.

Sir 23:27 And those who survive her will recognise that nothing is better than fearing the Lord, and nothing
sweeter than adherence to the Lord’s commandments.

Sir 24:1 Wisdom speaks her own praises, in the midst of her people she glories in herself.

Sir 24:2 She opens her mouth in the assembly of the Most High, she glories in herself in the presence of the
Mighty One:

Sir 24:3 “I came forth from the mouth of the Most High, and I covered the earth like mist.

Sir 24:4 I had my tent in the heights, and my throne was a pillar of cloud.

Sir 24:5 Alone, I have made the circuit of the heavens and walked through the depths of the abyss.

Sir 24:6 Over the waves of the sea and over the whole earth, and over every people and nation I have held
sway.

Sir 24:7 Among all these I searched for rest, and looked to see in whose territory I might pitch camp.

Sir 24:8 Then the Creator of all things instructed me and he who created me fixed a place for my tent. He said,
‘Pitch your tent in Jacob, make Israel your inheritance’.

Sir 24:9 From eternity, in the beginning, he created me, and for eternity I shall remain.

Sir 24:10 In the holy tent I ministered before him and thus became established in Zion.

Sir 24:1 1 In the beloved city he has given me rest, and in Jerusalem I wield my authority.

Sir 24:12 I have taken root in a privileged people, in the Lord’s property, in his inheritance.

Sir 24:13 I have grown tall as a cedar on Lebanon, as a cypress on Mount Hermon;

Sir 24:14 I have grown tall as a palm in En-Gedi, as the rose bushes of Jericho; as a fine olive in the plain, as a
plane tree, I have grown tall.

Sir 24:15 Like cinnamon and acanthus, I have yielded a perfume, like choice myrrh, have breathed out a scent,
like galbanum, onycha, labdanum, like the smoke of incense in the tent.

Sir 24:16 I have spread my branches like a terebinth, and my branches are glorious and graceful.

Sir 24:17 I am like a vine putting out graceful shoots, my blossoms bear the fruit of glory and wealth.

Sir 24:18

Sir 24:19 Approach me, you who desire me, and take your fill of my fruits,

Sir 24:20 for memories of me are sweeter than honey, inheriting me is sweeter than the honeycomb.

Sir 24:21 They who eat me will hunger for more, they who drink me will thirst for more.

Sir 24:22 No one who obeys me will ever have to blush, no one who acts as I dictate will ever sin”.

Sir 24:23 All this is no other than the Book of the Covenant of the Most High God, the Law that Moses enjoined
on us, an inheritance for the communities of Jacob.

Sir 24:24

Sir 24:25 This is what makes wisdom brim over like the Pishon, like the Tigris in the season of fruit,

Sir 24:26 what makes intelligence overflow like the Euphrates, like the Jordan at harvest time;

Sir 24:27 and makes discipline flow like the Nile, like the Gihon when the grapes are harvested.

Sir 24:28 The first man did not finish discovering about her, nor has the most recent tracked her down;

Sir 24:29 for her thoughts are wider than the sea, and her designs more profound than the abyss.

Sir 24:30 And I, like a conduit from a river, like a watercourse running into a garden,

Sir 24:31 I said, “I am going to water my orchard, I intend to irrigate my flower beds”. And see, my conduit has



grown into a river, and my river has grown into a sea.

Sir 24:32 Making discipline shine forth from daybreak, I shall send its light far and wide.

Sir 24:33 I shall pour out teaching like prophecy, as a legacy to all future generations.

Sir 24:34 And note, I have been working not merely for myself, but for all who are seeking wisdom.

Sir 25:1 There are three things my soul delights in, and which are delightful to God and to all people: concord
between brothers, friendship between neighbours, and a wife and husband who live happily together.

Sir 25:2 There are three sorts of people my soul hates, and whose existence I consider an outrage: the poor
swollen with pride, the rich who is a liar and an adulterous old man who has no sense.

Sir 25:3 If you have gathered nothing in your youth, how can you discover anything in your old age?

Sir 25:4 How fine a thing: sound judgement with grey hairs, and for greybeards to know how to advise!

Sir 25:5 How fine a thing: wisdom in the aged, and considered advice coming from people of distinction!

Sir 25:6 The crown of the aged is ripe experience, their glory, the fear of the Lord.

Sir 25:7 There are nine things I can think of which strike me as happy, and a tenth which is now on my tongue:
the man who can be proud of his children, he who lives to see the downfall of his enemies;

Sir 25:8 happy is he who keeps house with a sensible wife; he who does not toil with ox and donkey; he who
has never sinned with his tongue; he who does not serve a man less worthy than himself;

Sir 25:9 happy is he who has acquired good sense and can find attentive ears for what he has to say;

Sir 25:10 how great is he who has acquired wisdom; but unsurpassed is one who fears the Lord.

Sir 25:1 1 The fear of the Lord surpasses everything; what can compare with someöne who has mastered that?
Sir 25:12

Sir 25:13 Any wound rather than a wound of the heart! Any spite rather than the spite of woman!

Sir 25:14 Any evil rather than an evil caused by an enemy! Any vengeance rather than the vengeance of a foe!
Sir 25:15 There is no poison worse than the poison of a snake, there is no fury worse than the fury of an enemy.
Sir 25:16 I would sooner keep house with a lion or a dragon than keep house with a spiteful wife.

Sir 25:17 A woman’s spite changes her appearance and makes her face as grim as a bear’s.

Sir 25:18 When her husband goes out to dinner with his neighbours, he cannot help heaving bitter sighs.

Sir 25:19 No spite can approach the spite of a woman, may a sinner’s lot be hers!

Sir 25:20 Like the climbing of a sandhill for elderly feet, such is a garrulous wife for a quiet husband.

Sir 25:21 Do not be taken in by a woman’s beauty, never lose your head over a woman.

Sir 25:22 Bad temper, insolence and shame hold sway where the wife supports the husband.

Sir 25:23 Low spirits, gloomy face, stricken heart: such is a spiteful wife. Slack hands and sagging knees: such
is the wife who does not make her husband happy.

Sir 25:24 Sin began with a woman, and thanks to her we must all die.

Sir 25:25 Do not let water find a leak, nor a spiteful woman give free rein to her tongue.

Sir 25:26 If she will not do as you tell her, get rid of her.

Sir 26:1 How blessed is the husband of a really good wife; the number of his days will be doubled.

Sir 26:2 A perfect wife is the joy of her husband, he will live out the years of his life in peace.

Sir 26:3 A good wife is the best of portions, reserved for those who fear the Lord;

Sir 26:4 rich or poor, their hearts will be glad, their faces cheerful, whatever the season.

Sir 26:5 There are three things that I dread, and a fourth which terrifies me: slander by a whole town, the
gathering of a mob, and a false accusation — these are all worse than death;

Sir 26:6 but a woman jealous of a woman means heartbreak and sorrow, and all this is the scourge of the
tongue.

Sir 26:7 A bad wife is a badly fitting ox-yoke, trying to master her is like grasping a scorpion.

Sir 26:8 A drunken wife will goad anyone to fury, she cannot conceal her own degradation.

Sir 26:9 A woman’s wantonness shows in her wide-eyed look, her eyelashes leave no doubt.

Sir 26:10 Keep a headstrong daughter under firm control, or, feeling free, she will take advantage of it.

Sir 26:1 1 Keep a strict watch on her shameless eye, do not be surprised if she disgraces you.

Sir 26:12 Like a thirsty traveller she will open her mouth and drink any water she comes across; she will sit
down in front of every tent-peg and open her quiver to any arrow.

Sir 26:13 The grace of a wife will charm her husband, her understanding will make him the stronger.

Sir 26:14 A silent wife is a gift from the Lord, no price can be put on a well-trained character.

Sir 26:15 A modest wife is a boon twice over, a chaste character cannot be over-valued.

Sir 26:16 Like the sun rising over the mountains of the Lord, such is the beauty of a good wife in a well-run
house.

Sir 26:17 Like a lamp shining on the sacred lamp-stand, such is a beautiful face on a well-proportioned body.

Sir 26:18 Like golden pillars on a silver base, such are shapely legs on firm-set heels.

Sir 26:19
Sir 26:20



Sir 26:21
Sir 26:22
Sir 26:23
Sir 26:24
Sir 26:25
Sir 26:26
Sir 26:27

Sir 26:28 There are two things which grieve my heart and a third arouses my anger: a warrior wasting away
through poverty, the intelligent treated with contempt, someöne turning back from virtue to sin — the Lord marks
out such a person for a violent death.

Sir 26:29 It is difficult for a merchant to avoid doing wrong and for a trader not to incur sin.

Sir 27:1 Many have sinned for the sake of profit, one who hopes to be rich must turn a blind eye.

Sir 27:2 A peg will stick in the joint between two stones, and sin will wedge itself between selling and buying.

Sir 27:3 Whoëver does not firmly hold to the fear of the Lord, his house will soon be overthrown.

Sir 27:4 In a shaken sieve the rubbish is left behind, so too the defects of a person appear in speech.

Sir 27:5 The kiln tests the work of the potter, the test of a person is in conversation.

Sir 27:6 The orchard where the tree grows is judged by its fruit, similarly words betray what a person feels.

Sir 27:7 Do not praise anyone who has not yet spoken, since this is where people are tested.

Sir 27:8 If you pursue virtue, you will attain it and put it on like a festal gown.

Sir 27:9 Birds consort with their kind, truth comes home to those who practise it.

Sir 27:10 The lion lies in wait for its prey, so does sin for those who do wrong.

Sir 27:1 1 The conversation of the devout is wisdom at all times, but the fool is as changeable as the moon.

Sir 27:12 When visiting stupid people, choose the right moment, but among the thoughtful take your time.

Sir 27:13 The conversation of fools is disgusting, raucous their laughter in their sinful pleasures.

Sir 27:14 The talk of hard-swearing people makes your hair stand on end, their brawling makes you stop your
ears.

Sir 27:15 A quarrel between the proud leads to bloodshed, and their insults are embarrassing to hear.

Sir 27:16 A betrayer of secrets forfeits all trust and will never find the kind of friend he wants.

Sir 27:17 Be fond of a friend and keep faith with him, but if you have betrayed his secrets, do not go after him
any more;

Sir 27:18 for, as one destroys a person by killing him, so you have killed your neighbour’s friendship,

Sir 27:19 and as you let a bird slip through your fingers, so you have let your friend go, and will not catch him.

Sir 27:20 Do not go after him - he is far away, he has fled like a gazelle from the snare.

Sir 27:21 For a wound can be bandaged and abuse forgiven, but for the betrayer of a secret there is no hope.

Sir 27:22 Someöne with a sly wink is plotting mischief, no one can dissuade him from it.

Sir 27:23 Honey-tongued to your face, he is lost in admiration at your words; but behind your back he has other
things to say, and turns your words into a stumbling-block.

Sir 27:24 I have found many things to hate, but nothing as much as him, and the Lord hates him too.

Sir 27:25 Whoëver throws a stone in the air, throws it on to his own head; a treacherous blow cuts both ways.

Sir 27:26 The man who digs a pit falls into it, whoëver sets a snare will be caught by it.

Sir 27:27 On anyone who does evil, evil will recoil, without his knowing where it comes from.

Sir 27:28 Sarcasm and abuse are the mark of the arrogant, but vengeance lies in wait like a lion for such a one.
Sir 27:29 The trap will close on all who rejoice in the downfall of the devout, and pain will eat them up before
they die.

Sir 27:30 Resentment and anger, these are foul things too, and a sinner is a master at them both.

Sir 28:1 Whoëver exacts vengeance will experience the vengeance of the Lord, who keeps strict account of sin.
Sir 28:2 Pardon your neighbour any wrongs done to you, and when you pray, your sins will be forgiven.

Sir 28:3 If anyone nurses anger against another, can one then demand compassion from the Lord?

Sir 28:4 Showing no pity for someöne like oneself, can one then plead for one’s own sins?

Sir 28:5 Mere creature of flesh, yet cherishing resentment!-who will forgive one for sinning?

Sir 28:6 Remember the last things, and stop hating, corruption and death, and be faithful to the commandments.
Sir 28:7 Remember the commandments, and do not bear your fellow ill-will, remember the covenant of the Most
High, and ignore the offence.

Sir 28:8 Avoid quarrelling and you will sin less; for the hot-tempered provokes quarrels,

Sir 28:9 a sinner sows trouble between friends, introducing discord among the peaceful.

Sir 28:10 The way a fire burns depends on its fuel, a quarrel spreads in proportion to its violence; a man’s rage
depends on his strength, his fury grows fiercer in proportion to his wealth.

Sir 28:1 1 A sudden quarrel kindles fire, a hasty dispute leads to bloodshed.

Sir 28:12 Blow on a spark and up it flares, spit on it and out it goes; both are the effects of your mouth.



Sir 28:13 A curse on the scandal-monger and double-talker, such a person has ruined many who lived in
concord.

Sir 28:14 That third tongue has shattered the peace of many and driven them from nation to nation; it has pulled
down fortified cities, and overthrown the houses of the great.

Sir 28:15 The third tongue has had upright wives divorced, depriving them of reward for their hard work.

Sir 28:16 No one who listens to it will ever know peace of mind, will ever live in peace again.

Sir 28:17 A stroke of the whip raises a weal, but a stroke of the tongue breaks bones.

Sir 28:18 Many have fallen by the edge of the sword, but many more have fallen by the tongue.

Sir 28:19 Blessed is anyone who has been sheltered from it, and has not experienced its fury, who has not
dragged its yoke about, or been bound in its chains;

Sir 28:20 for its yoke is an iron yoke, its chains are bronze chains;

Sir 28:21 the death it inflicts is a miserable death, Sheol is preferable to it.

Sir 28:22 It cannot gain a hold over the devout, they are not burnt by its flames.

Sir 28:23 Those who desert the Lord will fall into it, it will flare up inextinguishably among them, it will be let
loose against them like a lion, it will tear them like a leopard.

Sir 28:24 Be sure you put a thorn-hedge round your property, lock away your silver and gold;

Sir 28:25 then make scales and weights for your words, and put a door with bolts across your mouth.

Sir 28:26 Take care you take no false step through it, in case you fall a prey to him who lies in wait.

Sir 29:1 Making your neighbour a loan is an act of mercy, to lend him a helping hand is to keep the
commandments.

Sir 29:2 Lend to your neighbour in his time of need, and in your turn repay your neighbour on time.

Sir 29:3 Be as good as your word and keep faith with him, and you will find your needs met every time.

Sir 29:4 Many treat a loan as a windfall, and embarrass those who have come to their rescue.

Sir 29:5 Until he gets something, a man will kiss his neighbour’s hand, and refer diffidently to his wealth; but
when the loan falls due, he puts this off, he repays with offhand words, and pleads the inconvenience of the time.
Sir 29:6 Even if he can be made to pay, his creditor will recover barely half, and consider even that a windfall.
But otherwise he will be cheated of his money, and undeservedly gain himself an enemy; the man will pay him
back in curses and abuse, and with insults instead of honour.

Sir 29:7 Many, not out of malice, refuse to lend; they are merely anxious not to be cheated for nothing.

Sir 29:8 Nevertheless, be patient with those who are badly off, do not keep them waiting on your generosity.

Sir 29:9 In obedience to the commandment, help the poor; do not turn the poor away empty-handed in their
need.

Sir 29:10 Spend your money on your brother or your friend, do not leave it under a stone to rust away.

Sir 29:1 1 Use your wealth as the Most High has decreed; you will find that more profitable than gold.

Sir 29:12 Stock your store-rooms with almsgiving; this will save you from all misfortune.

Sir 29:13 Better than sturdy shield or weighty spear, this will fight for you against the enemy.

Sir 29:14 A good man will go surety for his neighbour; only a shameless wretch would desert him.

Sir 29:15 Do not forget the favour your guarantor has done you; he has given his life for you.

Sir 29:16 A sinner is careless of his guarantor’s prosperity, the ungrateful forgets his deliverer.

Sir 29:17 Going surety has ruined many who were prosperous, tossing them about in a heavy sea.

Sir 29:18 It has driven the powerful from home to wander among foreign nations.

Sir 29:19 A wicked man in a hurry to stand guarantor in the hope of profit, is hurrying to be sentenced.

Sir 29:20 Come to your neighbour’s help as far as you can, but take care not to fall into the same plight.

Sir 29:21 The first thing in life is water, and bread, and clothing, and a house for the sake of privacy.

Sir 29:22 Better the life of the poor under a roof of planks, than lavish fare in somebody else’s house.

Sir 29:23 Whether you have little or much, be content with it, and you will not hear your household complaining.
Sir 29:24 It is a miserable life, going from house to house; wherever you stay, you dare not open your mouth,

Sir 29:25 you do not belong, you receive no thanks for the drink you pour out and hear embittering words into
the bargain:

Sir 29:26 “Come along, stranger, lay the table, what have you got ready? give me something to eat!”.

Sir 29:27 “Go away, stranger, make room for someöne important; my brother is coming to stay, I need the
house”.

Sir 29:28 It is hard for the reasonable to be begrudged hospitality to be shamed like a debtor.

Sir 30:1 Whoëver loves his son will beat him frequently so that in after years the son may be his comfort.

Sir 30:2 Whoëver is strict with his son will reap the benefit, and be able to boast of him to his acquaintances.

Sir 30:3 Whoëver educates his son will be the envy of his enemy, and will be proud of him among his friends.

Sir 30:4 Even when the father dies, he might well not be dead, since he leaves his likeness behind him.

Sir 30:5 In life he has had the joy of his company, dying, he has no anxieties.

Sir 30:6 He leaves an avenger against his enemies and a rewarder of favours for his friends.



Sir 30:7 Whoëver coddles his son will bandage his wounds, his heart will turn over at every cry.

Sir 30:8 A badly broken-in horse turns out stubborn, a son left to himself turns out headstrong.

Sir 30:9 Pamper your child and he will terrorise you, play along with him and he will bring you sorrow.

Sir 30:10 Do not laugh with him, or one day you will weep with him and end up gnashing your teeth.

Sir 30:1 1 While he is young, do not allow him his freedom and do not wink at his mistakes.

Sir 30:12 Bend his neck in youth, bruise his ribs while he is a child, or else he will grow stubborn and
disobedient, and hurt you very deeply.

Sir 30:13 Be strict with your son, and persevere with him, or you will rue his insolence.

Sir 30:14 Better be poor if healthy and fit than rich if tormented in body.

Sir 30:15 Health and strength are better than any gold, a robust body than untold wealth.

Sir 30:16 No riches can outweigh bodily health, no enjoyment surpass a cheerful heart.

Sir 30:17 Better death than a wretched life, and everlasting rest than chronic illness.

Sir 30:18 Good things lavished on a closed mouth are like food offerings put on a grave.

Sir 30:19 What use is an offering to an idol which can neither eat nor smell? How describe someöne pursued by
the Lord’s displeasure?

Sir 30:20 He looks and sighs like a eunuch embracing a pretty girl — how he sighs!

Sir 30:21 Do not abandon yourself to sorrow, do not torment yourself with brooding.

Sir 30:22 Gladness of heart is life to anyone, joy is what gives length of days.

Sir 30:23 Give your cares the slip, console your heart, chase sorrow far away; for sorrow has been the ruin of
many, and is no use to anybody.

Sir 30:24 Jealousy and anger shorten your days, and worry brings premature old age.

Sir 30:25 A genial heart makes a good trencherman, someöne who enjoys a good meal.

Sir 31:1 The sleeplessness brought by wealth makes a person lose weight, the worry it causes drives away
sleep.

Sir 31 :2 The worries of the daytime prevent you from sleeping, like a serious illness, they keep sleep at bay.

Sir 31 :3 The rich for ever toils, piling up money, and then, leaving off, he is gorged with luxuries;

Sir 31 :4 the poor for ever toils, barely making a living, and then, leaving off, is poorer than ever.

Sir 31 :5 No one who loves money can easily avoid sinning, whoëver pursues profit will be corrupted by it.

Sir 31 :6 Gold has been the ruin of many; their coming destruction was self-evident,

Sir 31 :7 since it is a snare for those who sacrifice to it and stupid people all get caught in it.

Sir 31 :8 Happy the rich who is found to be blameless and does not go chasing after gold.

Sir 31 :9 Who is he, so that we can congratulate him, for he has achieved marvels among his fellows?

Sir 31:10 Who has been through this test and emerged perfect? He may well be proud of that! Who has had the
chance to sin and has not sinned, had the chance to do wrong and has not done it?

Sir 31:11 His fortune will be firmly based and the assembly will acclaim his generosity.

Sir 31:12 If you are sitting down to a lavish table, do not display your greed, do not say, “What a lot to eat!”.

Sir 31:13 Remember, it is bad to have a greedy eye. Is any creature more wicked than the eye? - That is why it
is always weeping!

Sir 31:14 Do not reach out for anything your host has his eye on, do not jostle him at the dish.

Sir 31:15 Judge your fellow-guest’s needs by your own, be thoughtful in everyway.

Sir 31:16 Eat what is offered you like a well brought-up person, do not wolf your food or you will earn dislike.

Sir 31:17 For politeness’ sake be the first to stop; do not act the glutton, or you will give offence,

Sir 31:18 and if you are sitting with a large party, do not help yourself before the others do.

Sir 31:19 A little is quite enough for a well-bred person; his breathing is easy when he lies in bed.

Sir 31 :20 A moderate diet ensures sound sleep, one gets up early, in the best of spirits. Sleeplessness,
biliousness and gripe are what the glutton has to endure.

Sir 31 :21 If you are forced to eat too much, get up, go and vomit, and you will feel better.

Sir 31 :22 Listen to me, my child, do not disregard me, eventually you will see the force of my words. Be
moderate in all your activities and illness will never overtake you.

Sir 31 :23 People praise the person who keeps a splendid table, and their opinion of his munificence is sound.

Sir 31 :24 But a niggardly host provokes universal resentment and people will retail instances of his meanness.

Sir 31 :25 Do not play the valiant at your wine, for wine has been the undoing of many.

Sir 31 :26 The furnace proves the temper of steel, and wine proves hearts in the drinking bouts of braggarts.

Sir 31 :27 Wine gives life if drunk in moderation. What is life worth without wine? It came into being to make
people happy.

Sir 31 :28 Drunk at the right time and in the right amount, wine makes for a glad heart and a cheerful mind.

Sir 31 :29 Bitterness of soul comes of wine drunk to excess out of temper or bravado.

Sir 31 :30 Drunkenness excites the stupid to a fury to his own harm, it reduces his strength while leading to
blows.



Sir 31 :31 Do not provoke your fellow-guest at a wine feast, do not make fun of him when he is enjoying himself,
do not take him to task or annoy him by reclaiming money owed.

Sir 32:1 Have they made you the presider? Do not let it go to your head, behave like everyone else in the party,
see that they are happy and then sit down yourself.

Sir 32:2 Having discharged your duties, take your place so that your joy may be through theirs, and you may
receive the crown for your competence.

Sir 32:3 Speak, old man — it is proper that you should - but with discretion: do not spoil the music.

Sir 32:4 If someöne is singing, do not ramble on and do not play the sage at the wrong moment.

Sir 32:5 An amber seal on a precious stone, such is a concert of music at a wine feast.

Sir 32:6 An emerald seal in a golden setting, such are strains of music with a vintage wine.

Sir 32:7 Speak, young man, when you must, but twice at most, and then only if questioned.

Sir 32:8 Keep to the point, say much in few words; give the impression of knowing but not wanting to speak.

Sir 32:9 Among eminent people do not behave as though you were their equal; do not make frivolous remarks
when someöne else is speaking.

Sir 32:10 Lightning comes before the thunder, favour goes ahead of a modest person.

Sir 32:1 1 Leave in good time, do not bring up the rear, and hurry home without loitering.

Sir 32:12 There amuse yourself, and do what you have a mind to, but do not sin by arrogant talk.

Sir 32:13 And for all this bless your Creator, who intoxicates you with his favours.

Sir 32:14 Whoëver fears the Lord will accept his correction; those who look for him will win his favour.

Sir 32:15 Whoëver seeks the Law will be nourished by it, the hypocrite will find it a stumbling-block.

Sir 32:16 Those who fear the Lord win his approval, their good deeds shining like a light.

Sir 32:17 The sinner waves reproof aside, he finds an excuse for headstrong behaviour.

Sir 32:18 A sensible person never scorns a warning; foreigners and the proud do not know about fear.

Sir 32:19 Never act without reflection, and you will not regret your actions.

Sir 32:20 Do not venture on a rough road, for fear of stumbling over the stones.

Sir 32:21 Do not be over-confident on an even road
Sir 32:22 and beware of your own children.

Sir 32:23 Watch yourself in everything you do; this is also the way to keep the commandments.

Sir 32:24 Anyone who trusts in the Law obeys its precepts, no one who has confidence in the Lord will come to
harm.

Sir 33:1 No evil will befall one who fears the Lord, such a one will be rescued even in the ordeal.

Sir 33:2 No one who hates the Law is wise, one who is hypocritical about it is like a storm-tossed ship.

Sir 33:3 An intelligent person will put faith in the Law, for such a one the Law is as dependable as a prophecy.
Sir 33:4 Prepare what you have to say and you will get a hearing, marshal your information before you answer.
Sir 33:5 The feelings of a fool are like a cart-wheel, a fool’s thought revolves like a turning axle.

Sir 33:6 A rutting stallion is like a sarcastic friend; he neighs, whoëver rides him.

Sir 33:7 Why is one day better than another, though the sun gives the same daylight throughout the year?

Sir 33:8 They have been differentiated in the mind of the Lord, who has diversified the seasons and feasts;

Sir 33:9 some he has made more important and has hallowed, others he has made ordinary days.

Sir 33:10 Human beings come from the ground, Adam himself was formed out of earth;

Sir 33:1 1 in the fullness of his wisdom the Lord has made distinctions between them, and diversified their
conditions.

Sir 33:12 Some of them he has blessed, hallowing and setting them near him; others he has cursed and
humiliated by degrading them from their positions.

Sir 33:13 Like clay in the hands of the potter to mould as it pleases him, so are human beings in the hands of
their Maker to reward as he judges right.

Sir 33:14 Opposite evil stands good, opposite death, life; so too opposite the devout stands the sinner.

Sir 33:15 Contemplate all the works of the Most High, you will find they go in pairs, by opposites.

Sir 33:16 Although the last to come, I have kept my eyes open like a man picking up what the grape-pickers
have left.

Sir 33:17 By the blessing of the Lord I have come in first, and like a true grape-picker have filled my winepress.
Sir 33:18 And note, I have not been working merely for myself, but for all who seek instruction.

Sir 33:19 Listen to me, important public figures, presidents of the assembly, give ear!

Sir 33:20 Neither to son nor wife, brother nor friend, give power over yourself during your own lifetime. And do
not give your property to anyone else, in case you regret it and have to ask for it back.

Sir 33:21 As long as you live and there is breath in your body, do not yield power over yourself to anyone;

Sir 33:22 better for your children to come begging to you, than for you to have to go begging to them.

Sir 33:23 In all you do be the master, and leave a reputation unstained.

Sir 33:24 The day your life draws to a close, at the hour of death, then distribute your heritage.



Sir 33:25 Fodder, the stick and burdens for a donkey, bread, discipline and work for a slave.

Sir 33:26 Work your slave hard, and you will have peace of mind, leave his hands idle, and he will be asking for
his freedom.

Sir 33:27 Yoke and harness will bow the neck, for a bad servant, torments and the rack.

Sir 33:28 Set him to work, so that he will not be idle; idleness teaches every kind of mischief.

Sir 33:29 Keep him at his duties, where he should be, if he is disobedient, clap him in irons.

Sir 33:30 But do not be over-exacting with anyone, and do nothing contrary to justice.

Sir 33:31 You have only one slave? Treat him like yourself, since you have acquired him with blood.

Sir 33:32 You have only one slave? Treat him as a brother, since you need him as you need yourself.

Sir 33:33 If you ill-treat him and he runs away, which way will you go to look for him?

Sir 34:1 Vain and deceptive hopes are for the foolish, and dreams lend wings to fools.

Sir 34:2 As well clutch at shadows and chase the wind as put any faith in dreams.

Sir 34:3 Dreams are no different from mirrors; confronting a face, the reflection of that face.

Sir 34:4 What can be cleansed by uncleanness, what can be verified by falsehood?

Sir 34:5 Divinations, auguries and dreams are nonsense, like the fantasies of a pregnant woman.

Sir 34:6 Unless sent as emissaries from the Most High, do not give them a thought;

Sir 34:7 for dreams have led many astray, and those who relied on them have come to grief.

Sir 34:8 Fulfilling the Law requires no such falsehood, and wisdom is perfected in veracity.

Sir 34:9 A much travelled man knows many things, and a man of great experience will talk sound sense.

Sir 34:10 Someöne who has never had his trials knows little; but the travelled man is master of every situation.
Sir 34:1 1 I have seen many things on my travels, I have understood more than I can put into words.

Sir 34:12 I have often been in danger of death, but I have been spared, and this is why:

Sir 34:13 the spirit of those who fear the Lord can survive, for their hope is in someöne with power to save them.
Sir 34:14 No one who fears the Lord need ever hesitate, or ever be daunted, since the Lord is his hope.

Sir 34:15 Happy the soul of one who fears the Lord. On whom does he rely? Who supports him?

Sir 34:16 The eyes of the Lord watch over those who love him, he is their powerful protection and their strong
support, their screen from the desert wind, their shelter from the midday sun, a guard against stumbling, an
assurance against a fall.

Sir 34:17 He revives the spirit and brightens the eyes, he gives health, life and blessing.

Sir 34:18 The sacrifice of an offering unjustly acquired is a mockery; the gifts of the impious are unacceptable.
Sir 34:19 The Most High takes no pleasure in offerings from the godless, multiplying sacrifices will not gain
pardon for sin.

Sir 34:20 Offering sacrifice from the property of the poor is as bad as slaughtering a son before his father’s
eyes.

Sir 34:21 A meagre diet is the very life of the poor, to deprive them of it is to commit murder.

Sir 34:22 To take away a fellow-man’s livelihood is to kill him, to deprive an employee of his wages is to shed

blood.

Sir 34:23 If one person builds while another pulls down, what will they get out of it but trouble?

Sir 34:24 If one person prays and another calls down a curse, to which one’s voice is the Master going to listen?

Sir 34:25 If someöne washes after touching a corpse, and then touches it again, what is the good of his
washing?

Sir 34:26 Just so with someöne who fasts for sin, and then goes and commits it again. Who is going to hear that
person’s prayer? What is the good of the self-abasement?

Sir 35:1 One who keeps the Law multiplies offerings; one who follows the commandments offers communion
sacrifices.

Sir 35:2 Proof of gratitude is an offering of fine flour, almsgiving a sacrifice of praise.

Sir 35:3 To abandon wickedness is what pleases the Lord, to give up wrong-doing is an expiatory sacrifice.

Sir 35:4 Do not appear empty-handed in the Lord’s presence; for all these things are due under the
commandment.

Sir 35:5 The offering of the upright graces the altar, and its savour rises before the Most High.

Sir 35:6 The sacrifice of the upright is acceptable, its memorial will not be forgotten.

Sir 35:7 Honour the Lord with generosity, do not stint the first-fruits you bring.

Sir 35:8 Add a smiling face to all your gifts, and be cheerful as you dedicate your tithes.

Sir 35:9 Give to the Most High as he has given to you, as generously as your means can afford;

Sir 35:10 for the Lord is a good rewarder, he will reward you seven times over.

Sir 35:1 1 Do not try to bribe him with presents, he will not accept them, do not put your faith in wrongly
motivated sacrifices;

Sir 35:12 for the Lord is a judge who is utterly impartial.

Sir 35:13 He never shows partiality to the detriment of the poor, he listens to the plea of the injured party.



Sir 35:14 He does not ignore the orphan’s supplication, nor the widow’s as she pours out her complaint.

Sir 35:15 Do the widow’s tears not run down her cheeks, as she accuses the man who is the cause of them?

Sir 35:16 Whoëver wholeheartedly serves God will be accepted, his petitions will carry to the clouds.

Sir 35:17 The prayer of the humble pierces the clouds: and until it does, he is not to be consoled,

Sir 35:18 nor will he desist until the Most High takes notice of him, acquits the upright and delivers judgement.
Sir 35:19 And the Lord will not be slow, nor will he be dilatory on their behalf,

Sir 35:20 until he has crushed the loins of the merciless and exacted vengeance on the nations,

Sir 35:21 until he has eliminated the hordes of the arrogant and broken the sceptres of the wicked,

Sir 35:22 until he has repaid all people as their deeds deserve and human actions as their intentions merit,

Sir 35:23 until he has judged the case of his people and made them rejoice in his mercy.

Sir 35:24 Mercy is welcome in time of trouble, like rain clouds in time of drought.

Sir 36:1 Take pity on us, Master, Lord of the universe, look at us, spread fear of yourself throughout all other
nations.

Sir 36:2 Raise your hand against the foreign nations and let them see your might.

Sir 36:3 As, in their sight, you have proved yourself holy to us, so now, in our sight, prove yourself great to them.
Sir 36:4 Let them acknowledge you, just as we have acknowledged that there is no God but you, Lord.

Sir 36:5 Send new portents, do fresh wonders, win glory for your hand and your right arm.

Sir 36:6 Rouse your fury, pour out your rage, destroy the opponent, annihilate the enemy.

Sir 36:7 Hasten the day, remember the oath, and let people tell of your mighty deeds.

Sir 36:8 Let fiery wrath swallow up the survivor, and destruction overtake those who oppress your people.

Sir 36:9 Crush the heads of hostile rulers who say, “There is no one else but us!”.

Sir 36:10 Gather together all the tribes of Jacob, restore them their heritage as at the beginning.

Sir 36:1 1 Take pity, Lord, on the people called by your name, on Israel whom you have made your first-born.

Sir 36:12 Have compassion on your holy city, on Jerusalem, the place where you rest.

Sir 36:13 Fill Zion with your praises and your sanctuary with your glory.

Sir 36:14 Vindicate those whom you created first, fulfil what has been prophesied in your name.

Sir 36:15 Give those who wait for you their reward, let your prophets be proved true.

Sir 36:16 Grant, Lord, the prayer of your servants, in the terms of Aaron’s blessing on your people,

Sir 36:17 so that all the earth’s inhabitants may acknowledge that you are the Lord, the everlasting God.

Sir 36:18 The stomach takes in all kinds of food, but some foods are better than others.

Sir 36:19 As the palate discerns the flavour of game, so a shrewd listener detects lying words.

Sir 36:20 A perverse character causes depression in others; it needs experience to know how to repay such a
one.

Sir 36:21 A woman will accept any husband, but some daughters are better than others.

Sir 36:22 A woman’s beauty delights the beholder, a man likes nothing better.

Sir 36:23 If her tongue is kind and gentle, her husband is the happiest of men.

Sir 36:24 The man who takes a wife has the makings of a fortune, a helper to match himself, a pillar of support.
Sir 36:25 When property has no fence, it is open to plunder, when a man has no wife, he is aimless and
querulous.

Sir 36:26 Will anyone trust an armed thief who flits from town to town?

Sir 36:27 So it is with the man who has no nest, and lodges wherever night overtakes him.

Sir 37:1 Any friend will say, “I am your friend too”, but some friends are friends only in name.

Sir 37:2 Is it not a deadly sorrow when a comrade or a friend turns enemy?

Sir 37:3 O evil inclination, why were you created, to cover the earth with deceit?

Sir 37:4 One kind of comrade congratulates a friend in prosperity but in time of trouble appears on the other
side.

Sir 37:5 One kind of comrade genuinely feels for a friend and when it comes to a fight, springs to arms.

Sir 37:6 Do not forget the genuine friend, do not push him out of mind once you are rich.

Sir 37:7 Any adviser will offer advice, but some are governed by self-interest.

Sir 37:8 Beware of someöne who offers advice; first find out what he wants himself- since his advice coincides
with his own interest — in case he has designs on you

Sir 37:9 and tells you, “You are on the right road”, but stands well clear to see what will happen to you.

Sir 37:10 Do not consult anyone who looks at you askance, conceal your plans from people jealous of you.

Sir 37:1 1 Do not consult a woman about her rival, or a coward about war, a merchant about prices, or a buyer
about selling, anyone mean about gratitude, or anyone selfish about kindness, a lazy fellow about any sort of
work, or a casual worker about finishing a job, an idle servant about a major undertaking — do not rely on these
for any advice.

Sir 37:12 But have constant recourse to some devout person, whom you know to be a keeper of the
commandments, whose soul matches your own, and who, if you go wrong, will be sympathetic.



Sir 37:13 Finally, stick to the advice your own heart gives you, no one can be truer to you than that;

Sir 37:14 since a person’s soul often gives a clearer warning than seven watchmen perched on a watchtower.

Sir 37:15 And besides all this beg the Most High to guide your steps into the truth.

Sir 37:16 Reason should be the basis for every activity, reflection must come before any undertaking.

Sir 37:17 Thoughts are rooted in the heart, and this sends out four branches:

Sir 37:18 good and evil, life and death, and mistress of them always is the tongue.

Sir 37:19 One kind of person is clever at teaching others, yet is no good whatever to himself;

Sir 37:20 another, very eloquent, is detested and ends by starving to death,

Sir 37:21 not having won the favour of the Lord, and being destitute of all wisdom.

Sir 37:22 Another considers himself wise and proclaims his intellectual conclusions as certainties.

Sir 37:23 But the truly wise instructs his people and his intellectual conclusions are certainties.

Sir 37:24 The wise is showered with blessings, and all who see him will call him happy.

Sir 37:25 Human life lasts a number of days, but the days of Israel are beyond counting.

Sir 37:26 The wise will earn confidence among the people, his name will live for ever.

Sir 37:27 During your life, my child, see what suits your constitution, do not give it what you find disagrees with
it;

Sir 37:28 for not everything is good for everybody, nor does everybody like everything.

Sir 37:29 Do not be insatiable for any delicacy, do not be greedy for food,

Sir 37:30 for over-eating leads to illness and excess leads to liver-attacks.

Sir 37:31 Many people have died from over-eating; control yourself, and so prolong your life.

Sir 38:1 Treat the doctor with the honour that is his due, in consideration of his services; for he too has been

created by the Lord.

Sir 38:2 Healing itself comes from the Most High, like a gift received from a king.

Sir 38:3 The doctor’s learning keeps his head high, and the great regard him with awe.

Sir 38:4 The Lord has brought forth medicinal herbs from the ground, and no one sensible will despise them.

Sir 38:5 Did not a piece of wood once sweeten the water, thus giving proof of its power?

Sir 38:6 He has also given some people knowledge, so that they may draw credit from his mighty works.

Sir 38:7 He uses these for healing and relieving pain; the druggist makes up a mixture from them.

Sir 38:8 Thus, there is no end to his activities; thanks to him, well-being exists throughout the world.

Sir 38:9 My child, when you are ill, do not rebel, but pray to the Lord and he will heal you.

Sir 38:10 Renounce your faults, keep your hands unsoiled, and cleanse your heart from all sin.

Sir 38:1 1 Offer incense and a memorial of fine flour, make as rich an offering as you can afford.

Sir 38:12 Then let the doctor take over — the Lord created him too — do not let him leave you, for you need him.

Sir 38:13 There are times when good health depends on doctors.

Sir 38:14 For they, in their turn, will pray the Lord to grant them the grace to relieve and to heal, and so prolong
your life.

Sir 38:15 Whoëver sins in the eyes of his Maker, let such a one come under the care of the doctor!

Sir 38:16 My child, shed tears over the dead, lament for the dead to show your sorrow, then bury the body with
due ceremony and do not fail to honour the grave.

Sir 38:17 Weep bitterly, beat your breast, observe the mourning the dead deserves for a day or two, to avoid
censorious comment, and then be comforted in your sorrow;

Sir 38:18 for grief can lead to death, a grief-stricken heart loses all energy.

Sir 38:19 In affliction sorrow persists, a life of grief is hard to bear.

Sir 38:20 Do not abandon your heart to grief, drive it away, bear your own end in mind.

Sir 38:21 Do not forget, there is no coming back; you cannot help the dead, and you will harm yourself.

Sir 38:22 “Remember my doom, since it will be yours too; I yesterday, you today!”.

Sir 38:23 Once the dead are laid to rest, let their memory rest, do not fret for them, once their spirit departs.

Sir 38:24 Leisure gives the scribe the chance to acquire wisdom; a man with few commitments can grow wise.
Sir 38:25 How can the ploughman become wise, whose sole ambition is to wield the goad, driving his oxen,
engrossed in their work, his conversation limited to bullocks,

Sir 38:26 his thoughts absorbed in the furrows he traces and his long evenings spent in fattening heifers?

Sir 38:27 Similarly with all workmen and craftsmen, toiling day and night; those who engrave seals, for ever
trying to think of a new design, concentrating on catching a good likeness and staying up late to get the work
done.

Sir 38:28 Similarly with the blacksmith sitting by his anvil; he considers what to do with the pig-iron, the breath of
the fire scorches his skin, as he contends with the heat of the furnace; the noise of the hammer deafens him, his
eyes are fixed on the pattern; he concentrates on getting the job done well and stays up late to apply the
finishing touches.

Sir 38:29 Similarly with the potter, sitting at his work, turning the wheel with his feet; constantly on the alert over



his work, each flick of the finger premeditated;

Sir 38:30 he pummels the clay with his arm, and with his feet he kneads it; he concentrates on applying the
glaze right and stays up late to clean the kiln.

Sir 38:31 All these people rely on their hands and each is skilled at his own craft.

Sir 38:32 A town could not be inhabited without them, there would be no settling, no travelling.

Sir 38:33 But you will not find them in the parliament, they do not hold high rank in the assembly. They do not sit
on the judicial bench, and they do not meditate on the Law.

Sir 38:34 They are not remarkable for their culture or judgement, nor are they found frequenting the
philosophers. They sustain the structure of the world, and their prayer is concerned with their trade.

Sir 39:1 Not so with one who concentrates his mind and his meditation on the Law of the Most High. He
researches into the wisdom of all the Ancients, he occupies his time with the prophecies.

Sir 39:2 He preserves the discourses of famous men, he is at home with the niceties of parables.

Sir 39:3 He researches into the hidden sense of proverbs, he ponders the obscurities of parables.

Sir 39:4 He enters the service of princes, he is seen in the presence of rulers. He travels in foreign countries, he
has experienced human good and human evil.

Sir 39:5 At dawn and with all his heart he turns to the Lord his Creator; he pleads in the presence of the Most
High, he opens his mouth in prayer and makes entreaty for his sins.

Sir 39:6 If such be the will of the great Lord, he will be filled with the spirit of intelligence, he will shower forth
words of wisdom, and in prayer give thanks to the Lord.

Sir 39:7 He will grow upright in purpose and learning, he will ponder the Lord’s hidden mysteries.

Sir 39:8 He will display the instruction he has received, taking his pride in the Law of the Lord’s covenant.

Sir 39:9 Many will praise his intelligence and it will never be forgotten. His memory will not disappear,
generation after generation his name will live.

Sir 39:10 Nations will proclaim his wisdom, the assembly will celebrate his praises.

Sir 39:1 1 If he lives long, his name will be more glorious than a thousand others, and if he dies, that will satisfy
him just as well.

Sir 39:12 And here are some more of my reflections: yes, I am as full as the moon at the full!

Sir 39:13 Listen to me, devout children, and blossom like the rose that grows on the bank of a watercourse.

Sir 39:14 Give off a sweet smell like incense, flower like the lily, spread your fragrance abroad, sing a song of
praise blessing the Lord for all his works.

Sir 39:15 Declare the greatness of his name, proclaim his praise with song and with lyre, and this is how you
must sing his praises:

Sir 39:16 “How wonderful, the actions of the Lord! Whatever he orders is done at the proper time!”. You must not
say, “What is this? Why is that?”. There is a proper time for every question.

Sir 39:17 At his word, the water stops and piles up high, at his voice, the watery reservoirs take shape,

Sir 39:18 at his command, whatever he wants is done, no one can stop him, if he intends to save.

Sir 39:19 He can see whatever human beings are doing, nothing can be hidden from his eye;

Sir 39:20 his gaze stretches from eternity to eternity, and nothing can astonish him.

Sir 39:21 You must not say, “What is this? Why is that?”. for everything has been made for a purpose.

Sir 39:22 As his blessing covers the dry land like a river and soaks it like a flood,

Sir 39:23 so retribution is his legacy to the nations, just as he has turned fresh waters to salt.

Sir 39:24 His ways are as smooth for the devout, as they are full of obstacles for the wicked.

Sir 39:25 Good things were created from the beginning for good people, as bad ones were for sinners.

Sir 39:26 The prime needs of human beings for living are water and fire, iron and salt, wheat-flour, milk and
honey, the juice of the grape, oil and clothing.

Sir 39:27 All these are good for those who are good, but turn out bad for sinners.

Sir 39:28 Some winds have been created for punishing, in his fury, he uses them as scourges; on the day of
doom, they unleash their violence and appease the wrath of their Creator.

Sir 39:29 Fire and hail, famine and death, have all been created for punishing.

Sir 39:30 Wild animals’ fangs, scorpions, vipers, the avenging sword for the ruin of the godless:

Sir 39:31 all of them exult in discharging his orders, ready on earth whenever the need arises and, when their
time comes, not falling short of his word.

Sir 39:32 That is why I was determined from the outset, why I have pondered and why I have written,

Sir 39:33 “The works of the Lord are all good, when the time is right, he gives whatever is needed.

Sir 39:34 You must not say, ‘This is worse than that’, for, sooner or later, everything proves its worth.

Sir 39:35 So now, sing with all your heart and voice, and bless the name of the Lord!”.

Sir 40:1 A hard lot has been created for human beings, a heavy yoke lies on the children of Adam from the day
they come out of their mother’s womb, till the day they return to the mother of them all.

Sir 40:2 What fills them with foreboding and their hearts with fear is dread of the day of death.



Sir 40:3 From the one who sits on a glorious throne to the wretch in dust and ashes,

Sir 40:4 from the one who wears purple and a crown to the one dressed in sacking, all is fury and jealousy,
turmoil and unrest, fear of death, rivalry, strife.

Sir 40:5 And even at night while he rests on his bed his sleep only gives a new twist to his worries:

Sir 40:6 scarcely has he lain down to rest, when in his sleep, as if in broad daylight, he is troubled with
nightmares, like one who has escaped from a battle,

Sir 40:7 and at the moment of rescue he wakes up, amazed that there was nothing to be afraid of!

Sir 40:8 For all creatures, human and animal — and seven times more for sinners-
Sir40:9 there is death and blood and strife and the sword, disasters, famine, affliction, plague.

Sir 40:10 These things were all created for the wicked, and the Flood came because of them.

Sir 40:1 1 All that comes from the earth returns to the earth, and what comes from the water returns to the sea.
Sir 40:12 All bribery and injustice will be blotted out, but good faith will stand for ever.

Sir 40:13 Ill-gotten wealth will vanish like a torrent, like the single thunder-clap that heralds rain.

Sir 40:14 When he opens his hand, he rejoices, by the same token, sinners come to ruin.

Sir 40:15 The sprigs of the godless will not make many branches, tainted roots find only hard rock.

Sir 40:16 The reed that grows by every lake and river’s edge is the first plant to be uprooted.

Sir 40:17 Charity is a very paradise of blessing and almsgiving endures for ever.

Sir 40:18 For a person of private means and one who works hard, life is pleasant, better off than either, one who
finds a treasure.

Sir 40:19 Children and the founding of a city perpetuate a name: more esteemed than either, a perfect wife.

Sir 40:20 Wine and music cheer the heart; better than either, the love of wisdom.

Sir 40:21 Flute and harp add sweetness to a song; better than either, a melodious voice.

Sir 40:22 The eye longs for grace and beauty; better than either, the green of spring corn.

Sir 40:23 Friend or comrade — it is always well met; better than either, a wife and husband.

Sir 40:24 Brothers and allies are good in times of trouble; better than either, almsgiving to the rescue.

Sir 40:25 Gold and silver will steady your feet; more esteemed than either, good advice.

Sir 40:26 Money and strength make a confident heart; better than either, the fear of the Lord. With fear of the
Lord, nothing is lacking: no need to seek for other help.

Sir 40:27 Fear of the Lord is a paradise of blessing, a better protection than the highest reputation.

Sir 40:28 My child, do not live by sponging off others, better be dead than be a sponger.

Sir 40:29 A life spent in eyeing someöne else’s table cannot be accounted a life at all. Other people’s food
defiles the gullet; a wise, well-brought-up person will beware of doing this.

Sir 40:30 What a sponger says may sound very sweet but in his belly there burns a fire.

Sir 41:1 O death, how bitter it is to remember you for someöne peacefully living with his possessions, for
someöne with no worries and everything going well and who can still enjoy his food!

Sir 41 :2 O death, your sentence is welcome to one in want, whose strength is failing, to one worn out with age
and a thousand worries, resentful and impatient!

Sir 41 :3 Do not dread death’s sentence; remember those who came before you and those who will come after.
Sir 41 :4 This is the sentence passed on all living creatures by the Lord, so why object to what seems good to
the Most High? Whether your life lasts ten or a hundred or a thousand years, its length will not be held against
you in Sheol.

Sir 41 :5 Hateful brats, such are the children of sinners, who foregather in the haunts of the godless.

Sir 41 :6 The inheritance of sinners’ children is doomed to perish, their posterity will endure lasting reproach.

Sir 41 :7 A godless father will be blamed by his children for the reproach he has brought on them.

Sir 41 :8 A bad outlook for you, godless people, who have forsaken the Law of God Most High.

Sir 41 :9 When you were born, you were born to be accursed, and when you die, that curse will be your portion.
Sir 41:10 All that comes from the earth returns to the earth, so too the wicked proceed from curse to destruction.
Sir 41:11 Mourning concerns only the bodies of the dead, but the worthless name of sinners will be blotted out.
Sir 41:12 Be careful of your reputation, for it will last you longer than a thousand great hoards of gold.

Sir 41:13 A good life lasts a certain number of days, but a good reputation lasts for ever.

Sir 41:14 Keep my instructions and be at peace, my children. Wisdom hidden away and treasure undisplayed,
what use is either of these?

Sir 41:1 5 Better someöne who hides his folly than one who hides his wisdom.

Sir 41:16 Preserve a sense of shame in the following matters, for not every kind of shame is right to harbour,
nor is every situation correctly appraised by all.

Sir 41:1 7 Be ashamed, before father and mother, of depraved behaviour, and before prince or potentate of
telling lies;

Sir 41:1 8 of wrong-doing before judge or magistrate, and of impiety before the assembly of the people;

Sir 41:1 9 of sharp practice before your companion and your friend, and of theft before the neighbourhood you



live in.

Sir 41 :20 Before the truth and covenant of God, be ashamed of leaning elbows on the table,

Sir 41 :21 of being ungracious when giving or receiving, of ignoring those who greet you,

Sir 41 :22 of gazing at a loose woman, of repulsing your fellow-countryman,

Sir 41 :23 of misappropriating another’s portion or gift, of paying court to another man’s wife,

Sir 41 :24 of making advances to his servant-girl — do not go near her bed-

Sir 41 :25 of saying disagreeable things to friends — do not follow up a gift with a taunt-

Sir 41 :26 of repeating everything you hear and of betraying confidences.

Sir 41 :27 Then you will know what true shame is, and you will find yourself in everyone’s graces.

Sir 42:1 The following things you should not be ashamed of, and do not sin from fear of what others think:

Sir 42:2 of the Law of the Most High or of the covenant, of a verdict that acquits the godless,

Sir 42:3 of keeping accounts with a travelling companion, of settling property on your friends,

Sir 42:4 of being accurate over scales and weights, of making small and large profits,

Sir 42:5 of gaining from commercial transactions, of disciplining your children strictly, of lashing a wicked slave
till you draw blood.

Sir 42:6 With an interfering wife, it is as well to use your seal, and where there are many hands, lock things up.
Sir 42:7 Whatever stores you issue, do it by number and weight, spendings and takings, put everything in
writing.

Sir 42:8 Do not be ashamed to correct a stupid person or a fool, or an old dotard who bickers with young
people. Then you will show yourself really educated and win the approval of everyone.

Sir 42:9 Unknown to her, a daughter keeps her father awake, the worry she gives him drives away his sleep: in
her youth, in case she never marries, married, in case she should be disliked,

Sir 42:10 as a virgin, in case she should be defiled and found with child in her father’s house, having a husband,
in case she goes astray, married, in case she should be sterile!

Sir 42:1 1 Your daughter is headstrong? Keep a sharp look-out that she does not make you the laughing-stock of
your enemies, the talk of the town, the object of common gossip, and put you to public shame.

Sir 42:12 Do not stare at any man for his good looks, do not sit down with women;

Sir 42:13 for moth comes out of clothes, and woman’s spite out of woman.

Sir 42:14 Better a man’s spite than a woman’s kindness: women give rise to shame and reproach.

Sir 42:15 Next, I shall remind you of the works of the Lord, and tell of what I have seen. By the words of the Lord
his works come into being and all creation obeys his will.

Sir 42:16 The shining sun looks down on all things, and the work of the Lord is full of his glory.

Sir 42:17 The Lord has not granted the Holy Ones the power to tell of all his marvels which the Almighty Lord
has solidly constructed for the universe to stand firm in his glory.

Sir 42:18 He has fathomed both the abyss and the human heart and seen into their devious ways; for the Most
High knows all there is to know and sees the signs of the times.

Sir 42:19 He declares what is past and what will be, and reveals the trend of hidden things.

Sir 42:20 Not a thought escapes him, not a single word is hidden from him.

Sir 42:21 He has embellished the magnificent works of his wisdom, he is from everlasting to everlasting, nothing
can be added to him, nothing taken away, he needs no one’s advice.

Sir 42:22 How lovely, all his works, how dazzling to the eye!

Sir 42:23 They all live and last for ever, and, whatever the circumstances, all obey.

Sir 42:24 All things go in pairs, by opposites, he has not made anything imperfect:

Sir 42:25 one thing complements the excellence of another. Who could ever grow tired of gazing at his glory?

Sir 43:1 Pride of the heights, a clear vault of the sky — such is the beauty of the heavens, a glorious sight.

Sir 43:2 The sun, as he emerges, proclaims at his rising, “How wonderful a thing, the work of the Most High!”.

Sir 43:3 At his zenith, he parches the ground, who can withstand his blaze?

Sir 43:4 We have to blow the furnace to produce any heat, the sun burns the mountains three times as much;
breathing out blasts of fire, flashing his rays, he dazzles the eyes.

Sir 43:5 Great is the Lord who created him and whose word speeds him on his course.

Sir 43:6 And then the moon, ever punctual to mark the times, an everlasting sign:

Sir 43:7 It is the moon that signals the feasts, a luminary that wanes after being full.

Sir 43:8 The month derives its name from hers, she waxes wonderfully in her phases, banner of the hosts on
high, shining in the vault of heaven.

Sir 43:9 The glory of the stars makes the beauty of the sky, a brilliant adornment of the Lord on High.

Sir 43:10 At the words of the Holy One they stand as he decrees, and never grow slack at their watch.

Sir 43:1 1 See the rainbow and praise its Maker, so superbly beautiful in its splendour.

Sir 43:12 Across the sky it forms a glorious arc drawn by the hands of the Most High.

Sir 43:13 By his command he sends the snow, he speeds the lightning by his command.



Sir 43:14 In the same way, his treasuries open and the clouds fly out like birds.

Sir 43:15 His great power solidifies the clouds, then pulverises them into hail.

Sir 43:16 at the sight of him, the mountains quake. At his will the south wind blows, or the storm from the north
and the whirlwind.

Sir 43:17 At the roar of his thunder, the earth writhes in labour,

Sir 43:18 He sprinkles snow like birds alighting, it comes down like locusts settling. The eye marvels at the
beauty of its whiteness, and the mind is amazed at its falling.

Sir 43:19 Over the earth, like salt, he also pours hoarfrost, which, when it freezes, bristles like thorns.

Sir 43:20 The cold wind blows from the north, and ice forms on the water; it forms on every piece of standing
water, covering it like a breastplate.

Sir 43:21 The wind swallows up the mountains and scorches the desert, like a fire it consumes the vegetation.
Sir 43:22 But cloud brings swift healing, and dew brings joy after the heat.

Sir 43:23 By his own resourcefulness he has tamed the abyss, and planted it with islands.

Sir 43:24 Those who sail the sea tell of its dangers, their accounts fill our ears with amazement:

Sir 43:25 for there too exist strange and wonderful works, animals of every kind and huge sea creatures.

Sir 43:26 Thanks to God, his messenger reaches port, everything works out according to his word.

Sir 43:27 We could say much more and still fall short; to put it concisely, “He is all”.

Sir 43:28 Where shall we find sufficient power to glorify him, since he is the Great One, above all his works,

Sir 43:29 the awe-inspiring Lord, stupendously great, and wonderful in his power?

Sir 43:30 Exalt the Lord in your praises as high as you may — still he surpasses you. Exert all your strength
when you exalt him, do not grow tired — you will never come to the end.

Sir 43:31 Who has ever seen him to describe him? Who can glorify him as he deserves?

Sir 43:32 Many mysteries remain even greater than these, for we have seen only a few of his works,

Sir 43:33 the Lord himself having created all things and given wisdom to those who are devout.

Sir 44:1 Next let us praise illustrious men, our ancestors in their successive generations.

Sir 44:2 The Lord has created an abundance of glory, and displayed his greatness from earliest times.

Sir 44:3 Some wielded authority as kings and were renowned for their strength; others were intelligent advisers
and uttered prophetic sayings.

Sir 44:4 Others directed the people by their advice, by their understanding of the popular mind, and by the wise
words of their teaching;

Sir 44:5 others composed musical melodies and set down ballads;

Sir 44:6 others were rich and powerful, living peacefully in their homes.

Sir 44:7 All these were honoured by their contemporaries and were the glory of their day.

Sir 44:8 Some of them left a name behind them, so that their praises are still sung.

Sir 44:9 While others have left no memory, and disappeared as though they had not existed. They are now as
though they had never been, and so too, their children after them.

Sir 44:10 But here is a list of illustrious men whose good works have not been forgotten.

Sir 44:1 1 In their descendants they find a rich inheritance, their posterity.

Sir 44:12 Their descendants stand by the commandments and, thanks to them, so do their children’s children.
Sir 44:13 Their offspring will last for ever, their glory will not fade.

Sir 44:14 Their bodies have been buried in peace, and their name lives on for all generations.

Sir 44:15 The peoples will proclaim their wisdom, the assembly will celebrate their praises.

Sir 44:16 Enoch pleased the Lord and was transferred to heaven, an example for the conversion of all
generations.

Sir 44:17 Noah was found perfectly upright, in the time of retribution he became the heir: because of him a
remnant was preserved for the earth at the coming of the Flood.

Sir 44:18 Everlasting covenants were made with him that never again should every living creature perish by
flood.

Sir 44:19 Abraham, the great ancestor of a host of nations, no one was ever his equal in glory.

Sir 44:20 He observed the Law of the Most High, and entered into a covenant with him. He confirmed the
covenant in his own flesh, and proved himself faithful under ordeal.

Sir 44:21 The Lord therefore promised him on oath to bless the nations through his descendants, to multiply him
like the dust on the ground, to exalt his descendants like the stars, and to give them the land as their heritage,
from one sea to the other, from the River to the ends of the earth.

Sir 44:22 To Isaac too, for the sake of Abraham his father, he assured

Sir 44:23 the blessing of all humanity; he caused the covenant to rest on the head of Jacob. He confirmed him
in his blessings and gave him the land as his inheritance; he divided it into portions, and shared it out among the
twelve tribes.

Sir 45:1 From Jacob’s stock he produced a generous man who found favour in the eyes of all humanity, beloved



by God and people, Moses, of blessed memory.

Sir 45:2 He made him the equal of the holy ones in glory and made him strong, to the terror of his enemies.

Sir 45:3 By the word of Moses, he made prodigies cease and raised him high in the respect of kings; he gave
him commandments for his people, and showed him something of his glory.

Sir 45:4 For his loyalty and gentleness he sanctified him, choosing him alone out of all human beings;

Sir 45:5 he allowed him to hear his voice, and led him into the darkness;

Sir 45:6 he gave him the commandments face to face, the law of life and knowledge, to teach Jacob his
ordinances and Israel his decrees. He raised up Aaron, a holy man like Moses, his brother, of the tribe of Levi.
Sir 45:7 He made an everlasting covenant with him, and gave him the priesthood of the people. He adorned him
with impressive vestments, he dressed him in a robe of glory.

Sir 45:8 He clothed him in glorious perfection and invested him with rich ornaments, the breeches, the long
robe, the <i>ephod</i>.

Sir 45:9 To surround the robe he gave him pomegranates, and many gold bells all round to chime at every step,
for their sound to be heard in the Temple as a reminder to the children of his people;

Sir 45:10 and a sacred vestment of gold and aquamarine and scarlet, the work of an embroiderer; the pectoral
of judgement, the urim and thummim, of plaited crimson, the work of a craftsman;

Sir 45:1 1 precious stones cut like seals mounted in gold, the work of a jeweller, as a reminder with their
engraved inscriptions of the number of the tribes of Israel;

Sir 45:12 and a golden diadem on his turban, engraved with the seal of consecration; superb ornamentation,
magnificent work, adornment to delight the eye.

Sir 45:13 There had never been such lovely things before him, and no one else has ever put them on, but only
his own sons, and his descendants for all time.

Sir 45:14 His sacrifices were to be burnt entirely, twice each day and for ever.

Sir 45:15 Moses consecrated him and anointed him with holy oil; and this was an everlasting covenant for him,
and for his descendants as long as the heavens endure, that he should preside over worship, act as priest, and
bless the people in the name of the Lord.

Sir 45:16 He chose him out of all the living to offer sacrifices to the Lord, incense and perfume as a memorial to
make expiation for the people.

Sir 45:17 He entrusted him with his commandments, committed to him the statutes of the Law for him to teach
Jacob his decrees and enlighten Israel on his Law.

Sir 45:18 Others plotted against him, they were jealous of him in the desert, Dathan and Abiram and their men,
Korah and his crew in fury and rage.

Sir 45:19 The Lord saw it and was displeased, his raging fury made an end of them; he worked miracles on
them, consuming them by his flaming fire.

Sir 45:20 And he added to Aaron’s glory, he gave him an inheritance; he allotted him the offerings of the first-
fruits, before all else, as much bread as he could want.

Sir 45:21 Thus they eat the sacrifices of the Lord which he gave to him and his posterity.

Sir 45:22 But of the people’s territory he inherits nothing, he alone of all the people has no share, “For I myself
am your share and heritage”.

Sir 45:23 Phinehas son of Eleazar is third in glory because of his zeal in the fear of the Lord, because he stood
firm when the people revolted, with a staunch and courageous heart; and in this way made expiation for Israel.
Sir 45:24 Hence a covenant of peace was sealed with him, making him governor of both sanctuary and people,
and securing to him and his descendants the high priestly dignity for ever.

Sir 45:25 There was also a covenant with David son of Jesse, of the tribe of Judah, a royal succession by
exclusively linear descent, but the succession of Aaron passes to all his descendants.

Sir 45:26 May God endow your hearts with wisdom to judge his people uprightly, so that the virtues of your
ancestors may never fade, and their glory may pass to all their descendants!

Sir 46:1 Mighty in war was Joshua son of Nun, successor to Moses in the prophetic office, who well deserved
his name, and was a great saviour of the chosen people, wreaking vengeance on the enemies who opposed
him, and so bringing Israel into its inheritance.

Sir 46:2 How splendid he was when, arms uplifted, he brandished his sword against cities!

Sir 46:3 Who had ever shown such determination as his? He himself led the battles of the Lord.

Sir 46:4 Was not the sun held back by his hand, and one day drawn out into two?

Sir 46:5 He called on the Most High, the Mighty One, while pressing the enemies from all directions, and the
great Lord answered him with hard and violent hailstones.

Sir 46:6 He fell on that enemy nation, and at the Descent destroyed all resistance to make the nations
acknowledge his warlike prowess and that he was waging war on behalf of the Lord.

Sir 46:7 For he was a follower of the Mighty One, in the time of Moses showing his devotion, he and Caleb son
of Jephunneh, by opposing the whole community, by preventing the people from sinning, and by silencing the



mutters of rebellion.

Sir 46:8 Hence these two alone were preserved out of six hundred thousand men on the march, and brought
into their inheritance, into a land where milk and honey flow.

Sir 46:9 And the Lord conferred strength on Caleb too, which stayed by him into old age, so that he could invest
the highlands of the country which his descendants kept as their inheritance,

Sir 46:10 so that every Israelite might see that it is good to follow the Lord.

Sir 46:1 1 The Judges too, each when he was called, all men whose hearts were never disloyal, who never
turned their backs on the Lord — may their memory be blessed!

Sir 46:12 May their bones flourish again from the tomb, and may the names of those illustrious men be worthily
borne by their sons!

Sir 46:13 Samuel was the beloved of his Lord; prophet of the Lord, he instituted the kingdom, and anointed
rulers over his people.

Sir 46:14 By the Law of the Lord he judged the assembly, and the Lord watched over Jacob.

Sir 46:15 By his loyalty he was recognised as a prophet, by his words he was known to be a trustworthy seer.

Sir 46:16 He called on the Lord, the Mighty One, when his enemies pressed in from all directions, by offering a
sucking lamb.

Sir 46:17 And the Lord thundered from heaven, and made his voice heard in a rolling peal;

Sir 46:18 he massacred the leaders of the enemy, and all the rulers of the Philistines.

Sir 46:19 Before the time of his everlasting rest he bore witness to the Lord and his anointed, “Of no property,
not even a pair of sandals, have I ever deprived a soul”. Nor did anyone accuse him.

Sir 46:20 And, having fallen asleep, he prophesied again, warning the king of his end; he spoke from the depths
of the earth in prophecy, to blot out the wickedness of the people.

Sir 47:1 After him arose Nathan, to prophesy in the time of David.

Sir 47:2 As the fat is set apart from the communion sacrifice, so was David chosen out of the Israelites.

Sir 47:3 He played with lions as though with kids, and with bears as though with lambs.

Sir 47:4 While still a boy, did he not slay the giant and take away the people’s shame, by hurling a stone from
his sling and cutting short the boasting of Goliath?

Sir 47:5 For he called on the Lord Most High, who gave strength to his right arm to put a mighty warrior to death
and assert the strength of his own people.

Sir 47:6 Hence they gave him credit for ten thousand, and praised him while they blessed the Lord, by offering
him a crown of glory.

Sir 47:7 For he destroyed the enemies on every front, he annihilated his foes, the Philistines, and crushed their
strength for ever.

Sir 47:8 In all his activities he gave thanks to the Holy One Most High in words of glory; he put all his heart into
his songs out of love for his Creator.

Sir 47:9 He placed singers before the altar, melodiously to sing;

Sir 47:10 he gave the feasts their splendour, the festivals their solemn pomp, causing the Lord’s holy name to
be praised and the sanctuary to resound from dawn.

Sir 47:1 1 The Lord took away his sins, making his strength ever greater; he gave him a royal covenant, and a
glorious throne in Israel.

Sir 47:12 A wise son succeeded him, who lived content, thanks to him.

Sir 47:13 Solomon reigned in a time of peace, and God gave him peace all round so that he could raise a house
to his name and prepare an everlasting sanctuary.

Sir 47:14 How wise you were despite your youth, like a river, brimming over with intelligence!

Sir 47:15 Your mind ranged the earth, you filled it with mysterious sayings.

Sir 47:16 Your name reached the distant islands, and you were loved for your peace.

Sir 47:17 Your songs, your proverbs, your sayings and your answers were the wonder of the world.

Sir 47:18 In the name of the Lord God, of him who is called the God of Israel, you amassed gold like so much
tin, and made silver as common as lead.

Sir 47:19 You abandoned your body to women, you became the slave of your appetites.

Sir 47:20 You stained your honour, you profaned your stock, so bringing retribution on your children and
affliction for your folly:

Sir 47:21 the empire split in two, from Ephraim arose a rebel kingdom.

Sir 47:22 But the Lord never goes back on his mercy, never cancels any of his words, will neither deny offspring
to his elect nor stamp out the line of the man who loved him. And hence, he has granted a remnant to Jacob and
to David a root sprung from him.

Sir 47:23 Solomon rested with his ancestors, leaving one of his stock as his successor, the stupidest member of
the nation, brainless Rehoboam, who drove the people to rebel.

Sir 47:24 Next, Jeroboam son of Nebat, who made Israel sin, and set Ephraim on the way of evil; from then on



their sins multiplied so excessively as to drive them out of their country;

Sir 47:25 for they tried out every kind of wickedness, until vengeance overtook them.

Sir 48:1 Then the prophet Elijah arose like a fire, his word flaring like a torch.

Sir 48:2 It was he who brought famine on them and decimated them in his zeal.

Sir 48:3 By the word of the Lord he shut up the heavens, three times also he brought down fire.

Sir 48:4 How glorious you were in your miracles, Elijah! Has anyone reason to boast as you have? -
Sir 48:5 rousing a corpse from death, from Sheol, by the word of the Most High;

Sir 48:6 dragging kings down to destruction, and high dignitaries from their beds;

Sir 48:7 hearing a rebuke on Sinai and decrees of punishment on Horeb;

Sir 48:8 anointing kings as avengers, and prophets to succeed you;

Sir 48:9 taken up in the whirlwind of fire, in a chariot with fiery horses;

Sir 48:10 designated in the prophecies of doom to allay God’s wrath before the fury breaks, to turn the hearts of
fathers towards their children, and to restore the tribes of Jacob.

Sir 48:1 1 Blessed, those who will see you, and those who have fallen asleep in love; for we too shall certainly
have life.

Sir 48:12 Such was Elijah, who was enveloped in a whirlwind; and Elisha was filled with his spirit; throughout his
life no ruler could shake him, and no one could subdue him.

Sir 48:13 No task was too hard for him, and even in death his body prophesied.

Sir 48:14 In his lifetime he performed wonders, and in death his works were marvellous.

Sir 48:15 Despite all this the people did not repent, nor did they give up their sins, until they were herded out of
their country and scattered all over the earth;

Sir 48:16 only a few of the people were left, with a ruler of the House of David. Some of them did what pleased
the Lord, others piled sin on sin.

Sir 48:17 Hezekiah fortified his city, and laid on a water-supply inside it; with iron he tunnelled through the rock
and constructed storage-tanks.

Sir 48:18 In his days Sennacherib invaded and sent Rabshakeh; he lifted his hand against Zion, and boasted
loudly in his arrogance.

Sir 48:19 Then their hearts and hands trembled, they felt the pangs of a woman in labour,

Sir 48:20 but they called on the merciful Lord, stretching out their hands towards him. Swiftly the Holy One
heard them from heaven and delivered them by the agency of Isaiah;

Sir 48:21 he struck the camp of the Assyrians and his Angel annihilated them.

Sir 48:22 For Hezekiah did what is pleasing to the Lord, and was steadfast in the ways of David his father,

enjoined on him by the prophet Isaiah, a great man trustworthy in his vision.

Sir 48:23 In his days the sun moved back; he prolonged the life of the king.

Sir 48:24 In the power of the spirit he saw the last things, he comforted the mourners of Zion,

Sir 48:25 he revealed the future to the end of time, and hidden things long before they happened.

Sir 49:1 The memory of Josiah is like blended incense prepared by the perfumer’s art; it is as sweet as honey to
all mouths, and like music at a wine feast.

Sir 49:2 He took the right course, of converting the people, he rooted out the iniquitous abominations,

Sir 49:3 he set his heart on the Lord, in godless times he upheld the cause of religion.

Sir 49:4 Apart from David, Hezekiah and Josiah, they all heaped wrong on wrong, they abandoned the Law of

the Most High: the kings of Judah disappeared;

Sir 49:5 for they handed their power over to others and their honour to a foreign nation.

Sir 49:6 The holy, chosen city was burnt down, her streets were left deserted,

Sir 49:7 as Jeremiah had predicted; for they had ill-treated him, though consecrated a prophet in his mother’s
womb, to tear up and afflict and destroy, but also to build up and to plant.

Sir 49:8 Ezekiel saw a vision of glory which God showed to him above the chariot of the great winged creatures,

Sir 49:9 for he mentioned the enemies in the downpour to the advantage of those who follow the right way.

Sir 49:10 As for the twelve prophets, may their bones flower again from the tomb, since they have comforted
Jacob and redeemed him in faith and hope.

Sir 49:1 1 How shall we extol Zerubbabel? He was like a signet ring on the right hand,

Sir 49:12 so too was Joshua son of Jozadak; they who in their days built the Temple and raised a sanctuary
sacred to the Lord, destined to everlasting glory.

Sir 49:13 Great too is the memory of Nehemiah, who rebuilt our walls which lay in ruins, erected the bolted
gates and rebuilt our houses.

Sir 49:14 No one else has ever been created on earth to equal Enoch, for he was taken up from earth.

Sir 49:15 And no one else ever born has been like Joseph, the leader of his brothers, the prop of his people; his
bones received a visitation.

Sir 49:16 Shem and Seth were the most honoured of men, but above every living creature is Adam.



Sir 50:1 It was the High Priest Simon son of Onias who repaired the Temple during his lifetime and in his day
fortified the sanctuary.

Sir 50:2 He laid the foundations of double depth, the high buttresses of the Temple precincts.

Sir 50:3 In his day the pool was excavated, a reservoir as huge as the sea.

Sir 50:4 Anxious to save the people from ruin, he fortified the city against siege.

Sir 50:5 How splendid he was with the people thronging round him, when he emerged from the curtained shrine,
Sir 50:6 like the morning star among the clouds, like the moon at the full,

Sir 50:7 like the sun shining on the Temple of the Most High, like the rainbow gleaming against brilliant clouds,
Sir 50:8 like a rose in springtime, like a lily by a spring, like a branch of the incense tree in summer,

Sir 50:9 like fire and incense in the censer, like a massive golden vessel encrusted with every kind of precious
stone,

Sir 50:10 like an olive tree loaded with fruit, like a cypress soaring to the clouds;

Sir 50:1 1 when he took his ceremonial robe and put on his magnificent ornaments, when he went up to the holy
altar and filled the sanctuary precincts with his grandeur;

Sir 50:12 when he received the portions from the hands of the priests, himself standing by the altar hearth,
crowned with the circle of his brothers, as a cedar of Lebanon is by its foliage, as though surrounded by the
trunks of palm trees.

Sir 50:13 When all the sons of Aaron in their glory, with the offerings of the Lord in their hands, stood before the
whole assembly of Israel,

Sir 50:14 while he completed the rites at the altars, nobly presenting the offerings to the Almighty, Most High!

Sir 50:15 He would reach out his hand to the cup and pour a libation of wine, pouring it at the foot of the altar, a
fragrance pleasing to the Most High, King of All;

Sir 50:16 then the sons of Aaron would shout and blow their metal trumpets, making a mighty sound ring out as
a reminder before the Most High;

Sir 50:17 and immediately the people all together would fall on their faces to the ground, in adoration of their
Lord, the Almighty, God Most High,

Sir 50:18 and with the cantors chanting their hymns of praise. Sweet was the melody of all these voices,

Sir 50:19 as the people pleaded with the Lord Most High and prayed in the presence of the Merciful, until the
service of the Lord was completed and the ceremony at an end.

Sir 50:20 Then he would come down and raise his hands over the whole assembly of the Israelites, to give them
the Lord’s blessing from his lips, being privileged to pronounce his name;

Sir 50:21 and once again the people would bow low to receive the blessing of the Most High.

Sir 50:22 And now bless the God of all things, the doer of great deeds everywhere, who has exalted our days
from the womb and has acted mercifully towards us.

Sir 50:23 May he grant us cheerful hearts and bring peace in our time, in Israel for ages on ages.

Sir 50:24 May his mercy be faithfully with us, may he redeem us in our own times!

Sir 50:25 There are two nations that my soul detests, the third is not a nation at all:

Sir 50:26 the inhabitants of Mount Seir, the Philistines, and the stupid people living at Shechem.

Sir 50:27 Instruction in wisdom and knowledge is what has been written in this book by Jesus son of Sira
Eleazar of Jerusalem, who has poured a rain of wisdom from his heart.

Sir 50:28 Blessed is he who devotes his time to these and grows wise by taking them to heart!

Sir 50:29 If he practises them he will be strong enough for anything, since the light of the Lord is his path.

Sir 51:1 I shall give thanks to you, Lord and King, and praise you, God my Saviour, I give thanks to your name;
Sir 51 :2 for you have been my guard and support and redeemed my body from destruction, from the snare of
the lying tongue, from lips that fabricate falsehood; in the presence of my assailants, you were on my side; you
have been my support, you have redeemed me,

Sir 51 :3 true to your abounding kindness — and the greatness of your name — you liberated me from the fangs
of those seeking to devour me, from the clutches of those seeking my life, from the many ordeals which I have
endured,

Sir 51 :4 from the stifling heat which hemmed me in, from the heart of a fire which I had not kindled,

Sir 51 :5 from deep in the belly of Sheol,

Sir 51 :6 treacherous denunciations to the king. My soul has been close to death, my life had gone down to the
brink of Sheol.

Sir 51 :7 I was completely surrounded, there was no one to help me; I looked for someöne to help me, there was
no one.

Sir 51 :8 Then I remembered your mercy, Lord, and your deeds from earliest times, how you deliver those who
wait for you patiently, and save them from the clutches of their enemies.

Sir 51 :9 And I sent up my plea from the earth, I begged to be delivered from death.

Sir 51:10 I called on the Lord, the father of my Lord, “Do not desert me in the days of ordeal, in the days of the



proud, when we are helpless. I shall praise your name unceasingly and gratefully sing its praises”.

Sir 51:11 And my plea was heard, for you saved me from destruction, you delivered me from that time of evil.

Sir 51:12 And therefore I shall thank you and praise you, and bless the name of the Lord.

Sir 51:13 When I was still a youth, before I went travelling, in my prayers I asked outright for wisdom.

Sir 51:14 Outside the sanctuary I would pray for her, and to the last I shall continue to seek her.

Sir 51:15 From her blossoming to the ripening of her grape my heart has taken its delight in her. My foot has
pursued a straight path, I have sought her ever since my youth.

Sir 51:16 By bowing my ear a little, I have received her, and have found much instruction.

Sir 51:17 Thanks to her I have advanced; glory be to him who has given me wisdom!

Sir 51:18 For I was determined to put her into practice, have earnestly pursued the good, and shall not be put to
shame.

Sir 51:19 My soul has fought to possess her, I have been scrupulous in keeping the Law; I have stretched out
my hands to heaven and bewailed how little I knew of her;

Sir 51 :20 I have directed my soul towards her, and in purity I have found her; having my heart fixed on her from
the outset, I shall never be deserted;

Sir 51 :21 my very core having yearned to discover her, I have now acquired a good possession.

Sir 51 :22 In reward the Lord has given me a tongue with which I shall sing his praises.

Sir 51 :23 Come close to me, you ignorant, take your place in my school.

Sir 51 :24 Why complain about lacking these things when your souls are so thirsty for them?

Sir 51 :25 I have opened my mouth, I have said: “Buy her without money,

Sir 51 :26 put your necks under her yoke, let your souls receive instruction, she is near, within your reach”.

Sir 51 :27 See for yourselves: how slight my efforts have been to win so much peace.

Sir 51 :28 Buy instruction with a large sum of silver, thanks to her you will gain much gold.

Sir 51 :29 May your souls rejoice in the mercy of the Lord, may you never be ashamed of praising him.

Sir 51 :30 Do your work before the appointed time and at the appointed time he will give you your reward.
(Subscript:) Wisdom of Jesus, son of Sira.


Jer 1:1 The words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, one of the priests living at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin.

Jer 1 :2 The word of Yahweh came to him in the days of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth
year of his reign;

Jer 1 :3 then in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah
son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the deportation of Jerusalem, in the fifth month.

Jer 1 :4 The word of Yahweh came to me, saying:

Jer 1 :5 “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; before you came to birth I consecrated you; I appointed
you as prophet to the nations”.

Jer 1 :6 I then said, “Ah, ah, ah, Lord Yahweh; you see, I do not know how to speak: I am only a child!”.

Jer 1 :7 But Yahweh replied, “Do not say, ‘I am only a child,” for you must go to all to whom I send you and say
whatever I command you.



Jer 1 :8 Do not be afraid of confronting them, for I am with you to rescue you, Yahweh declares”.

Jer 1 :9 Then Yahweh stretched out his hand and touched my mouth, and Yahweh said to me: “There! I have put
my words into your mouth.

Jer 1:10 Look, today I have set you over the nations and kingdoms, to uproot and to knock down, to destroy and
to overthrow, to build and to plant”.

Jer 1:11 The word of Yahweh came to me, asking, “Jeremiah, what do you see?”. I answered, “I see a branch of
the Watchful Tree”.

Jer 1:12 Then Yahweh said, “Well seen, for I am watching over my word to perform it”.

Jer 1:13 A second time the word of Yahweh came to me, asking, “What do you see?”. I answered, “I see a

cooking pot on the boil, with its mouth tilting from the north”.

Jer 1:14 Then Yahweh said: “From the north disaster will come boiling over on all who live in the country,

Jer 1:15 for I am now summoning all the families of the kingdoms of the north, Yahweh declares. They will
come, and each will set his throne in front of the gates of Jerusalem, all round, against its walls and against all
the towns of Judah.

Jer 1:16 I shall pronounce my judgements on them because of all their wickedness, since they have abandoned
me, offering incense to other gods and worshipping what their own hands have made.

Jer 1:17 “As for you, prepare yourself for action. Stand up and tell them all I command you. Have no fear of
them and in their presence I will make you fearless.

Jer 1:18 For look, today I have made you into a fortified city, a pillar of iron, a wall of bronze to stand against the

whole country: the kings of Judah, its princes, its priests and the people of the country.

Jer 1:19 They will fight against you but will not overcome you, for I am with you, Yahweh declares, to rescue
you”.

Jer 2:1 The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,

Jer 2:2 “Go and shout this in Jerusalem’s ears: “Yahweh says this: ‘I remember your faithful love, the affection of
your bridal days, when you followed me through the desert, through a land unsown.

Jer 2:3 Israel was sacred to Yahweh; the first-fruits of his harvest; all who ate this incurred guilt, disaster befell
them, Yahweh declares’”.

Jer 2:4 Listen to Yahweh’s word, House of Jacob and all the families of the House of Israel.

Jer 2:5 Yahweh says this, “What did your ancestors find wrong in me for them to have deserted me so far as to
follow Futility and become futile themselves?

Jer 2:6 They never said, ‘Where is Yahweh, who brought us out of Egypt and led us through the desert, through
a land of plains and ravines, through a land of drought, of shadow dark as death, a land through which no one
passes and where no human being lives?’.

Jer 2:7 I brought you to a country of plenty, to enjoy its produce and good things; but when you entered you
defiled my country and made my heritage loathsome.

Jer 2:8 The priests never asked, ‘Where is Yahweh?’. Those skilled in the Law did not know me, the shepherds
too rebelled against me and the prophets prophesied by Baal and followed the Useless Ones.

Jer 2:9 So I must state my case against you once more, Yahweh declares, and state my case against your
children’s children:

Jer 2:10 Cross to the isles of the Kittim and look, send to Kedarand carefully observe, see if anything like this
has happened before!

Jer 2:1 1 Does a nation change its gods? - and these are not gods at all! Yet my people have exchanged their
Glory for the Useless One!

Jer 2:12 You heavens, stand aghast at this, horrified, utterly appalled, Yahweh declares.

Jer 2:13 For my people have committed two crimes: they have abandoned me, the fountain of living water, and
dug water-tanks for themselves, cracked water-tanks that hold no water.

Jer 2:14 “Is Israel a slave? Was he born into serfdom, for him to be preyed on like this?

Jer 2:15 Lions have roared at him, they have made their voices heard. They have left this country a desert, his
towns lie burnt and uninhabited.

Jer 2:16 The people of Noph and Tahpanhes have shaved your skull!

Jer 2:17 Have you not brought this on yourself, by abandoning Yahweh your God, when he was guiding you on
your way?

Jer 2:18 What is the good of going to Egypt now to drink the water of the Nile? What is the good of going to
Assyria to drink the water of the River?

Jer 2:19 Your wickedness will bring its own punishment, your infidelities will bring you to book, so give thought
and see how evil and bitter it is to abandon Yahweh your God and not to stand in awe of me, the Lord Yahweh
Sabaoth declares.

Jer 2:20 “It is long ago now since you broke your yoke, burst your bonds and said, ‘I will not serve!’. Yet on every
high hill and under every green tree you have sprawled and played the whore.



Jer 2:21 Yet I had planted you, a red vine of completely sound stock. How is it you have turned into seedlings of
a vine that is alien to me?

Jer 2:22 Even though you scrub yourself with soda and put in quantities of soap, the stain of your guilt would still
be visible to me, the Lord Yahweh declares.

Jer 2:23 How dare you say, ‘I am not defiled, I have not run after the Baals?’. Look at your behaviour in the
Valley, realise what you have done.

Jer 2:24 A wild she-donkey, at home in the desert, snuffing the breeze in desire; who can control her when she
is on heat? Males need not trouble to look for her, they will find her in her month.

Jer 2:25 Beware! Your own foot will go unshod, your own throat grow dry! But you said, ‘It is no use! No! For I
love the Strangers and they are the ones I shall follow’.

Jer 2:26 “Like a thief ashamed at being caught, so will the House of Israel be: they, their kings, their chief men,
their priests and their prophets,

Jer 2:27 who say to a piece of wood, ‘You are my father’, and to a stone, ‘You gave birth to me’. For they turn
to me their backs, never their faces; yet when trouble comes they shout, ‘Get up! Save us!’.

Jer 2:28 Where are your gods you made for yourself? Let them get up if they can save you when trouble comes!
For you have as many gods as you have towns, Judah!

Jer 2:29 Why make out a case against me? You have all rebelled against me, Yahweh declares.

Jer 2:30 In vain I have struck your children, they have not accepted correction; your own sword has devoured
your prophets like a marauding lion.

Jer 2:31 Now you of this generation, listen to what Yahweh says: Have I been a desert for Israel, or a land of
gloom? Why do my people say, ‘We are our own masters, we will come to you no more?’

Jer 2:32 Does a girl forget her ornaments, a bride her sash? And yet my people have forgotten me, days
beyond number.

Jer 2:33 “How well you set your course in pursuit of love! And so you have schooled your ways to wicked deeds.
Jer 2:34 The very skirts of your robe are stained with the blood of the poor, of innocent men you never caught
breaking and entering! And in spite of all this,

Jer 2:35 you say, ‘I am innocent, let his anger turn from me!’. Now I pass sentence on you for saying, ‘I have not
sinned’.

Jer 2:36 “How frivolously you undertake a change of course! But you will be disappointed by Egypt just as you
were by Assyria.

Jer 2:37 You will have to leave there too with your hands on your head, for Yahweh has rejected those that you
rely on, you will come to no good with them”.

Jer 3:1 “If a man divorces his wife and she leaves him and becomes someöne else’s, has he the right to go back
to her? Has not that piece of land been totally polluted? And you, having played the whore with many lovers, you
claim the right to come back to me! Yahweh demands.

Jer 3:2 “Lift your eyes to the bare heights and look! Where have you not offered your sex! You waited by the
roadside for them like an Arab in the desert. You have polluted the country with your prostitution and your vices:
Jer 3:3 this is why the showers have been withheld, the late rains have not come. “But you maintained a
prostitute’s bold front, with no trace of a blush.

Jer 3:4 From now on, do not cry out at me, ‘My father! My beloved ever since I was young!

Jer 3:5 Will he keep up his anger for ever, maintain his wrath to the end?’. You say this but still go on sinning,

being so obstinate”.

Jer 3:6 In the days of King Josiah, Yahweh said to me, “Have you seen what disloyal Israel has done? How she

has made her way up every high hill and to every green tree, and played the whore there?

Jer 3:7 I thought, ‘After doing all this she will come back to me’. But she did not come back. Her faithless sister
Judah saw this.

Jer 3:8 She also saw that I had repudiated disloyal Israel for all her adulteries and given her her divorce papers.
Her faithless sister Judah, however, was not afraid: she too went and played the whore.

Jer 3:9 And with her shameless whoring, she polluted the country; she committed adultery with stones and
pieces of wood.

Jer 3:10 Worse than all this: Judah, her faithless sister, has come back to me not in sincerity, but only in
pretence, Yahweh declares”.

Jer 3:1 1 And Yahweh said to me, “Disloyal Israel is upright, compared with faithless Judah.

Jer 3:12 So go and shout words towards the north, and say: ‘Come back, disloyal Israel, Yahweh declares, I
shall frown on you no more, since I am merciful, Yahweh declares. I shall not keep my anger for ever.

Jer 3:13 Only acknowledge your guilt: how you have rebelled against Yahweh your God, how you have
prostituted yourself with the Strangers under every green tree and have not listened to my voice, Yahweh
declares.

Jer 3:14 ‘Come back, disloyal children, Yahweh declares, for I alone am your Master, and I will take you, one



from a town, two from a family, and bring you to Zion.

Jer 3:15 I shall give you shepherds after my own heart, who will pasture you wisely and discreetly.

Jer 3:16 Then, when you have increased and grown numerous in the country, Yahweh declares, no one will
ever again say: The ark of the covenant of Yahweh! It will not enter their minds, they will not remember it or miss
it, nor will another one be made.

Jer 3:17 When that time comes, Jerusalem will be called: The Throne of Yahweh, and all the nations will
converge on her, on Yahweh’s name, on Jerusalem, and will no longer follow their own stubborn and wicked
inclinations.

Jer 3:18 ‘When those days come, the House of Judah will join the House of Israel; together they will come from
the land of the north to the country I gave your ancestors as their heritage’.

Jer 3:19 “And I was thinking: How am I to rank you as my children? I shall give you a country of delights, the
fairest heritage of all the nations! I thought: You will call me Father and will never cease to follow me.

Jer 3:20 But like a woman betraying her lover, House of Israel, you have betrayed me”, Yahweh declares.

Jer 3:21 A noise is heard on the bare heights: the weeping and entreaty of the Israelites, for they have gone
wildly astray, have forgotten Yahweh their God.

Jer 3:22 “Come back, disloyal sons, I want to cure your disloyalty”. “We are here, we are coming to you, for you
are Yahweh our God.

Jer 3:23 The hills are a delusion after all, so is the tumult of the mountains. Yahweh our God is, after all, the
saving of Israel.

Jer 3:24 Shame has devoured what our ancestors worked for ever since we were young, their flocks and herds,
their sons and their daughters.

Jer 3:25 Let us lie down in our shame, let our confusion cover us, for we have sinned against Yahweh our God,
we and our ancestors, from our youth until today, and have not listened to the voice of Yahweh our God”.

Jer 4:1 “If you come back, Israel, Yahweh declares, if you come back to me, if you take your Horrors out of my
sight, if you go roving no more,

Jer 4:2 if you swear, ‘As Yahweh lives!’. truthfully, justly, uprightly, then the nations will bless themselves by him
and glory in him.

Jer 4:3 “For Yahweh says this to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, ‘Clear the ground that lies neglected, do not
sow among thorns.

Jer 4:4 Circumcise yourselves for Yahweh, apply circumcision to your hearts, men of Judah and inhabitants of
Jerusalem, or my wrath will leap out like a fire and burn with no one to quench it, in return for the wickedness of
your deeds’”.

Jer 4:5 Announce it in Judah, proclaim it in Jerusalem, say, “Sound the trumpet in the countryside, shout the
message aloud: Mobilise! Take to the fortified towns!

Jer 4:6 Signpost the way to Zion! Run! Do not delay! For I am bringing disaster from the north, an immense
calamity.

Jer 4:7 The lion is up from his thicket, the destroyer of nations is on his way, he has come from his home to
reduce your land to a desert; your towns will be in ruins, uninhabited.

Jer 4:8 So wrap yourselves in sackcloth, lament and wail, since Yahweh’s burning anger has not turned away
from us.

Jer 4:9 “That day”, Yahweh declares, “the king’s heart will fail him, the princes’ hearts will fail them too, the
priests will stand aghast, the prophets stupefied”.

Jer 4:10 Then I said, “Ah, Lord Yahweh, how sadly you deceived this people and Jerusalem when you used to
say, ‘You will have peace’, whereäs the sword is now at our throats!

Jer 4:1 1 When that time comes, this will be said to this people and to Jerusalem: The scorching wind from the
desert heights comes towards the daughter of my people -and not to winnow or to cleanse!

Jer 4:12 A gale of wind comes to me from over there. Now I myself shall pass sentence on them!”.

Jer 4:13 Look, he is advancing like the clouds, his chariots like a hurricane, his horses swifter than eagles.
Disaster for us! We are lost!

Jer 4:14 Wash your heart clean of wickedness, Jerusalem, and so be saved. How long will you go on
harbouring your pernicious thoughts?

Jer 4:15 For a voice from Dan shouts the news, proclaims disaster from the highlands of Ephraim.

Jer 4:16 Report it to the nations, proclaim it to Jerusalem, “Enemies are coming from a distant country, shouting
their war cry against the towns of Judah;

Jer 4:17 they surround her like watchmen round a field because she has rebelled against me”, Yahweh
declares.

Jer 4:18 “Your own behaviour and actions have brought this on yourself. Your wickedness, how bitter, has
stabbed you to the heart!”.

Jer 4:19 In the pit of my stomach how great my agony! Walls of my heart! My heart is throbbing! I cannot keep



quiet, for I have heard the trumpet call, the battle cry.

Jer 4:20 Ruin on ruin is the news: the whole land is laid waste, my tents are suddenly destroyed, in one moment
all that sheltered me.

Jer 4:21 How long must I see the standard and hear the trumpet call?

Jer 4:22 This is because my people are stupid, they do not know me, they are slow-witted children, they have
no understanding, they are clever enough at doing wrong, but do not know how to do right”.

Jer 4:23 I looked to the earth — it was a formless waste; to the heavens, and their light had gone.

Jer 4:24 I looked to the mountains — they were quaking and all the hills rocking to and fro.

Jer 4:25 I looked — there was no one at all, the very birds of heaven had all fled.

Jer 4:26 I looked — the fruitful land was a desert, all its towns in ruins before Yahweh, before his burning anger.

Jer 4:27 Yes, Yahweh has said this, “The whole country will be laid waste, though I shall not annihilate it
completely.

Jer 4:28 For this, the earth will go into mourning and the heavens above grow dark. For I have spoken, I have
decided, I shall not change my mind or go back on it”.

Jer 4:29 At the din of horseman and archer the entire city takes to flight: some plunge into the thickets, others
scale the rocks; every town is abandoned, not a single person is left there.

Jer 4:30 And, once despoiled, what are you going to do? You may dress yourself in scarlet, put on ornaments of
gold, enlarge your eyes with paint but you make yourself pretty in vain. Your former lovers disdain you, your life
is what they are seeking.

Jer 4:31 Yes, I hear screams like those of a woman in labour, anguish like that of a woman giving birth to her
first child; they are the screams of the daughter of Zion, gasping, hands outstretched, “Unhappy me! I am dying,
the murderers have killed me!”.

Jer 5:1 Rove the streets of Jerusalem, now look and enquire, see in her squares if you can find an individual,
one individual who does right and seeks the truth, and I will pardon her, Yahweh says.

Jer 5:2 Although they say, “As Yahweh lives”, they are, in fact, swearing a false oath.

Jer 5:3 Yahweh, do your eyes not look for truth? You have struck them; they have not felt it. You have
annihilated them, for they ignored the lesson. They have set their faces harder than rock, they have refused to
repent.

Jer 5:4 I thought, “These are only the poor! They behave stupidly since they do not know Yahweh’s way or the
ruling of their God.

Jer 5:5 I shall approach the great men and speak to them, for these will know Yahweh’s way and the ruling of
their God”. But these, too, have broken the yoke, have burst the bonds.

Jer 5:6 And so, a lion from the forest will slaughter them, a wolf from the plains will despoil them, a leopard will
be lurking round their towns: anyone who goes out will be torn to pieces — because of their many crimes, their
countless infidelities.

Jer 5:7 “Why should I pardon you? Your sons have abandoned me, to swear by gods that are not gods at all. I
fed them full, and they became adulterers, they hurried to the brothel.

Jer 5:8 They are well-fed, roving stallions, each neighing for his neighbour’s wife.

Jer 5:9 Shall I fail to punish this, Yahweh demands, or on such a nation to exact vengeance?

Jer 5:10 Scale her terraces! Destroy! But do not annihilate her completely! Strip off her branches, for Yahweh
does not own them!

Jer 5:1 1 How treacherously they have treated me, the House of Israel and the House of Judah! Yahweh
declares.

Jer 5:12 “They have denied Yahweh, they have said, ‘He is nothing; no evil will overtake us, we shall not see
sword or famine.

Jer 5:13 And the prophets? Nothing but wind; the word is not in them; let those very things happen to them!’”.
Jer 5:14 Because of this, Yahweh, God Sabaoth, says this, “Since you have said such things, now I shall make
my words a fire in your mouth, and make this people wood, for the fire to devour.

Jer 5:15 Now I shall bring on you a nation from afar, House of Israel, Yahweh declares, an enduring nation, an
ancient nation, a nation whose language you do not know, nor can you grasp what they say.

Jer 5:16 Their quiver a gaping tomb, they are all of them fighters.

Jer 5:17 They will devour your harvest and your food, devour your sons and daughters, devour your flocks and
herds, devour your vines and fig trees, and demolish your fortified towns in which you trust — with the sword!”.

Jer 5:18 “Yet even in those days, Yahweh declares, I shall not annihilate you completely.

Jer 5:19 “And when you ask, ‘Why has Yahweh our God done all this to us?’. you will give them this answer, ‘As
you abandon me to serve alien gods in your own country, so you must serve aliens in a country not your own’.
Jer 5:20 “Announce this in the House of Jacob, proclaim it in Judah, and say,

Jer 5:21 ‘Now listen to this, stupid, brainless people who have eyes and do not see, who have ears and do not
hear!



Jer 5:22 Have you no fear of me? Yahweh demands. Will you not tremble before me who set the sand as limit to
the sea, as an everlasting barrier it cannot pass? Its waves may toss but not prevail, they may roar but cannot
pass beyond.

Jer 5:23 But this people has a rebellious, unruly heart; they have rebelled and gone!

Jer 5:24 Nor do they say to themselves: Now we ought to fear Yahweh our God who gives the rain, of autumn
and of spring, at the right season, and reserves us the weeks appointed for harvest.

Jer 5:25 Your misdeeds have upset all this, your sins have deprived you of these blessings’.

Jer 5:26 Yes, there are wicked men among my people who watch like fowlers on the alert; they set traps and
they catch human beings.

Jer 5:27 Like a cage full of birds so are their houses full of loot; they have grown rich and powerful because of it,
Jer 5:28 they are fat, they are sleek, in wickedness they go to any lengths: they have no respect for rights, for
orphans’ rights, and yet they succeed! They have not upheld the cause of the needy.

Jer 5:29 Shall I fail to punish this, Yahweh demands, or on such a nation to exact vengeance?

Jer 5:30 Horrible, disgusting things are happening in the land:

Jer 5:31 the prophets prophesy falsely and the priests exploit the people. And my people love it! But when the
end comes, what will you do?

Jer 6:1 Flee in a body, Benjaminites, right away from Jerusalem! Sound the trumpet in Tekoa! Light the beacon
on Beth-ha-Cherem! For disaster lowers from the north, an immense calamity.

Jer 6:2 Beautiful, delicate as she is, I shall destroy the daughter of Zion!

Jer 6:3 Shepherds are advancing on her with their flocks. They have pitched their tents all round her, each
grazes his part.

Jer 6:4 Prepare for holy war against her! To arms! We shall attack at noon! Disaster for us! The light is fading,
the evening shadows lengthen.

Jer 6:5 To arms! We shall attack at night and destroy her palaces.

Jer 6:6 For Yahweh Sabaoth says this, “Cut down trees, throw up an earthwork outside Jerusalem: this is the
city to be punished, with nothing but oppression in her.

Jer 6:7 As a well keeps its water fresh so she keeps her wickedness fresh. Violence and ruin are what you hear
in her, wounds and blows always forced on my attention.

Jer 6:8 Reform, Jerusalem, or I shall turn my attention away from you and reduce you to a desert, a land without
people”.

Jer 6:9 Yahweh Sabaoth says this, “They will glean, glean what is left of Israel like a vine. Like a grape-picker,
pass your hand again over the branches!”.

Jer 6:10 To whom should I speak, whom warn, for them to hear? Look, their ears are uncircumcised, they
cannot listen. Look, for them Yahweh’s word is something to sneer at, they have no taste for it.

Jer 6:11 So I am full of Yahweh’s wrath, I am weary of holding it in. Then pour it on the children in the streets,
and on the bands of youths as well, for husband and wife will both be taken, the greybeard and the man weighed
down with years.

Jer 6:12 Their houses will pass to other men, so will their fields and wives. Yes, I shall stretch my hand over
those living in this country, Yahweh declares.

Jer 6:13 For, from the least to greatest, they are all greedy for gain; prophet no less than priest, all of them
practise fraud.

Jer 6:14 Without concern they dress my people’s wound, saying, “Peace! Peace!”. whereäs there is no peace.

Jer 6:15 They should be ashamed of their loathsome deeds. Not they! They feel no shame, they do not even
know how to blush. And so as others fall, they too will fall, will be thrown down when I come and punish them,
Yahweh says.

Jer 6:16 Yahweh says this, “Stand at the crossroads and look, ask for the ancient paths: which was the good
way? Take it and you will find rest for yourselves. But they have said, ‘We will not take it’.

Jer 6:17 I posted look-outs on your behalf: Listen to the sound of the trumpet! But they said, ‘We will not listen’.
Jer 6:18 Then hear, you nations, and know, assembly, what is going to happen to them!

Jer 6:19 Listen, earth! Watch, I shall bring disaster on this people: it is the fruit of the way they think, since they
have not listened to my words nor to my law, but have rejected it.

Jer 6:20 What do I care about incense imported from Sheba, or fragrant cane from a distant country? Your burnt
offerings are not acceptable, your sacrifices do not please me”.

Jer 6:21 And so, Yahweh says this, “In front of this people I shall now lay obstacles for them to stumble over;
father and son alike, neighbour and friend will perish”.

Jer 6:22 Yahweh says this, “Look, a people is coming from the land of the north, from the far ends of the earth a
great nation is rising;

Jer 6:23 they are armed with bow and spear, they are cruel and pitiless; their noise is like the roaring of the sea;
they are riding horses, they are ready to fight against you as one man, against you, daughter of Zion.



Jer 6:24 We have heard the news, our hands fall limp, anguish has gripped us, pain like that of a woman in
labour.

Jer 6:25 Do not go out into the countryside, do not venture onto the roads, for the enemy’s sword is there, terror
on every side.

Jer 6:26 Put on sackcloth, daughter of my people, roll in ashes; mourn as for an only son, a very bitter dirge. For
on us suddenly the destroyer is coming.

Jer 6:27 “I have appointed you as tester of my people, to learn and to test how they behave.

Jer 6:28 All of them are total rebels peddlers of slander, hard as bronze and iron, all agents of corruption.

Jer 6:29 The bellows blast away to make the fire burn away the lead. In vain the smelter does his work, for the
dross is not purged out.

Jer 6:30 ‘Silver-reject’, men call them, and indeed Yahweh has rejected them!”.

Jer 7:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying,

Jer 7:2 “Stand at the gate of the Temple of Yahweh and there proclaim this message. Say, ‘Listen to the word of
Yahweh, all you of Judah who come in by these gates to worship Yahweh.

Jer 7:3 Yahweh Sabaoth, the God of Israel, says this: Amend your behaviour and your actions and I will let you
stay in this place.

Jer 7:4 Do not put your faith in delusive words, such as: This is Yahweh’s sanctuary, Yahweh’s sanctuary,
Yahweh’s sanctuary!

Jer 7:5 But if you really amend your behaviour and your actions, if you really treat one another fairly,

Jer 7:6 if you do not exploit the stranger, the orphan and the widow, if you do not shed innocent blood in this
place and if you do not follow other gods, to your own ruin,

Jer 7:7 then I shall let you stay in this place, in the country I gave for ever to your ancestors of old.

Jer 7:8 Look, you are putting your faith in delusive, worthless words!

Jer 7:9 Steal, would you, murder, commit adultery, perjure yourselves, burn incense to Baal, follow other gods
of whom you know nothing? -

Jer 7:10 and then come and stand before me in this Temple that bears my name, saying: Now we are safe to go
on doing all these loathsome things!

Jer 7:1 1 Do you look on this Temple that bears my name as a den of bandits? I, at any rate, can see straight,
Yahweh declares.

Jer 7:12 ‘Now go to the place which used to be mine at Shiloh, where I once gave my name a home; see what I
have done to it because of the wickedness of my people Israel!

Jer 7:13 And now, since you have done all these things, Yahweh declares, and refused to listen when I spoke
so urgently, so persistently, or to answer when I called you,

Jer 7:14 I shall treat this Temple that bears my name, and in which you put your heart, the place that I gave you
and your ancestors, just as I treated Shiloh,

Jer 7:15 and I shall drive you out of my sight, as I did all your kinsfolk, the whole race of Ephraim’.

Jer 7:16 “You, for your part, must not intercede for this people, nor raise either plea or prayer on their behalf; do
not plead with me, for I will not listen to you.

Jer 7:17 Can you not see what they are doing in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?

Jer 7:18 The children collect the wood, the fathers light the fire, the women knead the dough, to make cakes for
the Queen of Heaven; and, to spite me, they pour libations to alien gods.

Jer 7:19 Is it really me they spite, Yahweh demands, is it not in fact themselves, to their own confusion?

Jer 7:20 So, Lord Yahweh says this, ‘My anger, my wrath will be poured down on this place, on man and beast,
on the trees of the countryside and the fruits of the soil; it will burn, and not be quenched’.

Jer 7:21 “Yahweh Sabaoth, the God of Israel, says this, ‘Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices and eat all
the meat.

Jer 7:22 For when I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, I said nothing to them, gave them no orders, about
burnt offerings or sacrifices.

Jer 7:23 My one command to them was this: Listen to my voice, then I will be your God and you shall be my
people. In everything, follow the way that I mark out for you, and you shall prosper.

Jer 7:24 But they did not listen, they did not pay attention; they followed their own devices, their own stubborn
and wicked inclinations, and got worse rather than better.

Jer 7:25 From the day your ancestors left Egypt until today, I have sent you all my servants the prophets,
persistently sending them day after day.

Jer 7:26 But they have not listened to me, have not paid attention; they have deliberately resisted, behaving
worse than their ancestors.

Jer 7:27 So you will tell them all this, but they will not listen to you; you will call them, but they will not answer
you’.

Jer 7:28 Then you are to say to them, ‘This is the nation that will neither listen to the voice of Yahweh its God



nor take correction. Sincerity is no more, it has vanished from their mouths.

Jer 7:29 ‘Cut off your tresses, throw them away! On the bare heights raise a dirge, for Yahweh has rejected,
has abandoned, a brood that enrages him!’.

Jer 7:30 “Yes, the people of Judah have done what displeases me, Yahweh declares. They have set up their
Horrors in the Temple that bears my name, to defile it,

Jer 7:31 and have built the high places of Topheth in the Valley of Ben-Hinnom, to burn their sons and
daughters: a thing I never ordered, that had never entered my thoughts.

Jer 7:32 So now the days are coming, Yahweh declares, when people will no longer say Topheth or Valley of
Ben-Hinnom, but Valley of Slaughter. Topheth will become a burial ground, for lack of other space;

Jer 7:33 the corpses of this people will be food for the birds of the sky and the animals of earth, and there will be
no one to drive them off.

Jer 7:34 I shall silence the shouts of rejoicing and mirth and the voices of bridegroom and bride, in the towns of
Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, for the country will be reduced to desert”.

Jer 8:1 “When that time comes, Yahweh declares, the bones of the kings of Judah, the bones of its chief men,
the bones of the priests, the bones of the prophets and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, will be taken
from their tombs.

Jer 8:2 They will be spread out before the sun, the moon, the whole array of heaven, whom they have loved and
served, followed, consulted and worshipped. They will not be gathered or reburied but will be left lying on the
surface like dung.

Jer 8:3 And death will seem preferable to life to all the survivors of this wicked race, wherever I have driven
them, Yahweh Sabaoth declares.

Jer 8:4 “You are to tell them, ‘Yahweh says this: If someöne falls, can he not stand up again? If people stray,
can they not turn back?

Jer 8:5 Why does this people persist in acts of infidelity, why does Jerusalem persist in continuous infidelity?
They cling to illusion, they refuse to turn back.

Jer 8:6 I have listened attentively: they have never said anything like that. Not one repents of wickedness
saying: What have I done? Each one keeps returning to the course like a horse charging into battle.

Jer 8:7 Even the stork in the sky knows the appropriate season; turtledove, swallow and crane observe their
time of migration. But my people do not know Yahweh’s laws!’”.

Jer 8:8 How can you say, “We are wise, since we have Yahweh’s Law?”. Look how it has been falsified by the
lying pen of the scribes!

Jer 8:9 The wise are put to shame, alarmed, caught out because they have rejected Yahweh’s word. What price
their wisdom now?

Jer 8:10 So I shall give their wives to other men, their fields to new masters, for, from the least to greatest, they
are all greedy for gain; prophet no less than priest, all of them practise fraud.

Jer 8:11 Without concern they dress the wound of the daughter of my people, saying, “Peace! Peace!”. whereäs
there is no peace.

Jer 8:12 They should be ashamed of their loathsome deeds. Not they! They feel no shame, they do not even
know how to blush. And so as others fall, they too will fall, will be thrown down when the time for punishing them
comes, Yahweh says.

Jer 8:13 I shall put an end to them, Yahweh declares, no more grapes on the vine, no more figs on the fig tree
only withered leaves: I have found them people to trample on them!

Jer 8:14 Why are we sitting still? Mobilise! Take to the fortified towns and there fall silent, since Yahweh our
God means to silence us by giving us poisoned water to drink because we have sinned against him.

Jer 8:15 We are hoping for peace — no good came of it! For the time of healing — nothing but terror!

Jer 8:16 From Dan you can hear the snorting of his horses; at the neighing of his stallions the whole country
quakes; they are coming to devour the country and its contents, the town and those that live in it.

Jer 8:17 Yes, now I am sending you poisonous snakes against which no charm exists; and they will bite you,
Yahweh declares.

Jer 8:18 Incurable sorrow overtakes me, my heart fails me.

Jer 8:19 Hark, from the daughter of my people the cry for help, ringing far and wide throughout the land! “Is
Yahweh no longer in Zion, her King no longer there?”. (Why have they provoked me with their idols, with their
futile foreign gods?)

Jer 8:20 “Harvest is over, summer at an end, and we have not been saved!”.

Jer 8:21 The wound of the daughter of my people wounds me too, all looks dark to me, terror grips me.

Jer 8:22 Is there no balm in Gilead any more? Is no doctor there? Then why is there no progress in the cure of
the daughter of my people?

Jer 8:23 Who will turn my head into a fountain, and my eyes into a spring of tears, that I can weep day and night
over the slain of the daughter of my people?



Jer 9:1 Who will find me a wayfarer’s shelter in the desert, for me to quit my people, and leave them far behind?
For all of them are adulterers, a conspiracy of traitors.

Jer 9:2 They bend their tongues like a bow; not truth but falsehood holds sway in the land; yes, they go from
crime to crime, but me they do not know, Yahweh declares.

Jer 9:3 Let each be on his guard against his friend; do not trust a brother, for every brother aims but to supplant,
and every friend is a peddler of slander.

Jer 9:4 Each one cheats his friend, never telling the truth; they have trained their tongues to lie and devote all
their energies to doing wrong.

Jer 9:5 You live in a world of bad faith! Out of bad faith, they refuse to know me, Yahweh declares.

Jer 9:6 And, so, Yahweh Sabaoth declares, now I shall purge them and test them, no other way to treat the
daughter of my people!

Jer 9:7 Their tongue is a deadly arrow, their words are in bad faith; with his mouth each wishes his neighbour
peace, while in his heart plotting a trap for him.

Jer 9:8 Shall I fail to punish them for this, Yahweh demands, or on such a nation fail to exact vengeance?

Jer 9:9 I raise the wail and lament for the mountains, the dirge for the desert pastures, for they have been burnt:
no one passes there, the sound of flocks is heard no more. Birds of the sky and animals, all have fled, all are
gone.

Jer 9:10 I shall make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, a lair for jackals, and the towns of Judah an uninhabited
wasteland.

Jer 9:1 1 Who is wise enough to understand this? To whom has Yahweh’s mouth spoken to explain it? Why is
the country annihilated, burnt like the desert where no one passes?

Jer 9:12 Yahweh says, This is because they have forsaken my Law which I gave them and have not listened to
my voice or followed it,

Jer 9:13 but have followed their own stubborn hearts, have followed the Baals as their ancestors taught them”.
Jer 9:14 So Yahweh Sabaoth, the God of Israel, says this, “Now I shall give this people wormwood to eat and
poisoned water to drink.

Jer 9:15 I shall scatter them among nations unknown to their ancestors or to them; and I shall pursue them with
the sword until I have annihilated them”.

Jer 9:16 Yahweh Sabaoth says this, “Prepare to call for the mourning women! Send for those who are best at it!
Jer 9:17 Let them lose no time in raising the lament over us! Let our eyes rain tears, our eyelids run with
weeping!

Jer 9:18 A lament makes itself heard in Zion, ‘What ruin is ours, what utter shame! For we must leave the
country, our homes have been knocked down!’”.

Jer 9:19 Now listen, you women, to Yahweh’s word, let your ears take in the word his own mouth speaks. Teach
your daughters how to wail and teach one another this dirge,

Jer 9:20 “Death has climbed in at our windows, and made its way into our palaces; it has cut down the children
in the street, the young people in the squares-

Jer 9:21 Speak! Yahweh declares this — human corpses are strewn like dung in the open field, like sheaves left
by the reaper, with no one to gather them”.

Jer 9:22 Yahweh says this, “Let the sage not boast of wisdom, nor the valiant of valour, nor the wealthy of
riches!

Jer 9:23 But let anyone who wants to boast, boast of this: of understanding and knowing me. For I am Yahweh,
who acts with faithful love, justice, and uprightness on earth; yes, these are what please me”, Yahweh declares.
Jer 9:24 “Look, the days are coming, Yahweh declares, when I shall punish all who are circumcised only in the
flesh:

Jer 9:25 Egypt, Judah, Edom, the Ammonites, Moab, and all the men with shaven temples who live in the
desert. For all those nations, and the whole House of Israel too, are uncircumcised at heart”.

Jer 10:1 Listen, House of Israel, to the word that Yahweh addresses to you. Yahweh says this:

Jer 1 0:2 “Do not learn the ways of the nations or take alarm at the heavenly signs, alarmed though the nations
may be at them.

Jer 1 0:3 Yes, the customs of the peoples are quite futile: wood, nothing more, cut out of a forest, worked with a
blade by a carver’s hand,

Jer 1 0:4 then embellished with silver and gold, then fastened with hammer and nails to keep it from moving.

Jer 10:5 Like scarecrows in a melon patch, they cannot talk, they have to be carried, since they cannot walk.
Have no fear of them: they can do no harm — nor any good either!”.

Jer 10:6 Yahweh, there is no one like you, so great you are, so great your mighty name.

Jer 1 0:7 Who would not revere you, King of nations? Yes, this is your due. Since of all the wise among the
nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is not a single one like you.

Jer 10:8 All of them are brutish and stupid: the Futile Ones’ teaching is but wood,



Jer 1 0:9 silver leaf imported from Tarshish and gold from Ophir, the work of carver or goldsmith; then dressed
up in violet and purple, all the work of skilled men.

Jer 10:10 But Yahweh is the true God. He is the living God, the everlasting King. The earth quakes when he is
wrathful, the nations cannot endure his fury.

Jer 10:1 1 “Tell them this, ‘The gods who did not make the heavens and the earth will vanish from the earth and
from under these heavens’”.

Jer 10:12 By his power he made the earth, by his wisdom set the world firm, but his discernment spread out the
heavens.

Jer 10:13 When he thunders there is a roaring of waters in heaven; he raises clouds from the remotest parts of
the earth, makes the lightning flash for the downpour, and brings the wind from his storehouse.

Jer 10:14 At this all people stand stupefied, uncomprehending, every goldsmith blushes for his idols; his
castings are but delusion, with no breath in them.

Jer 10:15 They are futile, a laughable production; when the time comes for them to be punished, they will
vanish.

Jer 10:16 The Heritage of Jacob is not like these, for he is the maker of everything, and Israel is the tribe that is
his heritage. His name is Yahweh Sabaoth.

Jer 10:17 Pick up your pack from the ground, you the besieged!

Jer 10:18 For Yahweh says this, “Now I shall throw out the inhabitants of the country, this time, and bring
distress on them, so that they may find me!”.

Jer 10:19 Disaster is on me! What a wound! My injury is incurable! And I used to think, “If this is the worst, I can
bear it!”.

Jer 10:20 But now my tent is destroyed, all my ropes are snapped, my sons have left me and are no more; no
one is left to put my tent up again or to hang the side-cloths.

Jer 10:21 The shepherds are the ones who have been stupid: they have not searched for Yahweh. This is why
they have not prospered and why their whole flock has been dispersed.

Jer 1 0:22 Listen! A terrible noise! A mighty uproar from the land of the north to reduce the towns of Judah to
desert, to a lair for jackals!

Jer 10:23 I know, Yahweh, no one’s course is in his control, nor is it in anyone’s power, as he goes his way, to
guide his own steps.

Jer 10:24 Correct me, Yahweh, but with moderation, not in your anger, or you will reduce me to nothing.

Jer 10:25 Pour out your anger on the nations who do not acknowledge you, and on the families that do not call
on your name, for they have devoured Jacob, have devoured and made an end of him and reduced his home to
desolation.

Jer 11:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh,

Jer 1 1 :2 “Hear the terms of this covenant; tell them to the people of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
Jer 1 1:3 Tell them, ‘Yahweh, God of Israel, says this: Cursed be anyone who will not listen to the terms of this
covenant

Jer 1 1 :4 which I ordained for your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, out of that iron-foundry. Listen to
my voice, I told them, carry out all my orders, then you will be my people and I shall be your God,

Jer 11:5 so that I may fulfil the oath I swore to your ancestors, that I may give them a country flowing with milk
and honey, as is the case today’”. I replied, “So be it, Yahweh!”.

Jer 1 1 :6 Then Yahweh said to me, “Proclaim all these terms in the towns of Judah and in the streets of
Jerusalem, saying, ‘Listen to the terms of this covenant and obey them.

Jer 1 1 :7 For when I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, I solemnly warned them, and have persistently warned
them until today, saying: Listen to my voice.

Jer 1 1:8 But they did not listen, did not pay attention; instead, each followed his own stubborn and wicked
inclinations. And against them, in consequence, I put into action the words of this covenant which I had ordered
them to obey and which they had not obeyed’”.

Jer 1 1 :9 Yahweh said to me, “Plainly there is conspiracy among the people of Judah and the citizens of
Jerusalem.

Jer 11:10 They have reverted to the sins of their ancestors who refused to listen to my words: they too are
following other gods and serving them. The House of Israel and the House of Judah have broken my covenant
which I made with their ancestors.

Jer 11:11 And so, Yahweh says this, ‘I shall now bring a disaster on them which they cannot escape; they will
call to me for help, but I shall not listen to them.

Jer 11:12 The towns of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem will then go and call for help to the gods to whom
they burn incense, but these will be no help at all to them in their time of distress!

Jer 11:13 ‘For you have as many gods as you have towns, Judah! You have built as many altars to Shame, as
many incense altars to Baal, as Jerusalem has streets!



Jer 11:14 ‘You, for your part, must not intercede for this people, nor raise either plea or prayer on their behalf,
for I will not listen when their distress forces them to call to me for help’.

Jer 11:15 “What is my beloved doing in my house? She has achieved her wicked plans. Can vows and
consecrated meat turn disaster from you for you to be so happy?

Jer 11:16 ‘Green olive-tree covered in fine fruit’, was Yahweh’s name for you. With a shattering noise he has
set fire to it, its branches are broken”.

Jer 11:17 And Yahweh Sabaoth, who planted you, has decreed disaster for you because of the evil the House
of Israel and the House of Judah have done, provoking me by burning incense to Baal.

Jer 11:18 Yahweh informed me and I knew it; you then revealed their scheming to me.

Jer 11:19 I for my part was like a trustful lamb being led to the slaughterhouse, not knowing the schemes they
were plotting against me, “Let us destroy the tree in its strength, let us cut him off from the land of the living, so
that his name may no longer be remembered!”.

Jer 1 1 :20 Yahweh Sabaoth, whose judgement is upright, tester of motives and thoughts, I shall see your
vengeance on them, for I have revealed my cause to you.

Jer 1 1:21 Against the people of Anathoth who are determined to kill me and say to me, “Do not prophesy in the
name of Yahweh or you will die at our hands!”.

Jer 1 1 :22 Yahweh says this, “I am about to punish them. Their young people will die by the sword, their sons
and daughters by famine.

Jer 1 1 :23 Not one will be left when I bring disaster on the people of Anathoth, when the year for punishing them
comes”.

Jer 12:1 Your uprightness is too great, Yahweh, for me to dispute with you. But I should like to discuss some
points of justice with you: Why is it that the way of the wicked prospers? Why do all treacherous people thrive?
Jer 12:2 You plant them, they take root, they flourish, yes, and bear fruit. You are on their lips, yet far from their
heart.

Jer 12:3 You know me, Yahweh, you see me, you probe my heart, which is close to yours. Drag them off like
sheep for the slaughterhouse, reserve them for the day of butchery.

Jer 12:4 (How long will the land be in mourning, and the grass wither all over the countryside? The animals and
birds are dying as a result of the wickedness of the inhabitants.) For they say, “God does not see our fate”.

Jer 12:5 “If you find it exhausting to race against me on foot, how will you compete against horses? In a country
at peace you feel secure, but how will you fare in the thickets of the Jordan?

Jer 12:6 “For even your brothers and your own family will betray you. They will pursue you in full cry. Put no faith
in them when they speak you fair!”.

Jer 12:7 I have abandoned my house, left my heritage, I have delivered what I dearly loved into the clutches of
its enemies.

Jer 12:8 To me, my heritage has behaved like a lion in the forest, it roared at me ferociously: so I now hate it.

Jer 12:9 I see my heritage as a brightly-coloured bird of prey attacked by birds of prey on every side! Go,
assemble all the wild animals, make them come and dine!

Jer 12:10 Many shepherds have laid my vineyard waste, have trampled over my plot of land, the plot of land
which was my joy, reducing my favourite estate to a deserted wilderness.

Jer 12:1 1 They have made it a waste; wasted, it mourns before me. The whole country has been devastated
and no one takes it to heart.

Jer 12:12 The devastators have arrived on all the bare heights of the desert (for Yahweh wields a devouring
sword); from one end of the country to the other, there is no peace for any living thing.

Jer 12:13 Wheat they have sown, thorns they reap: they have worn themselves out, to no profit. They are
disappointed in their harvests, because of Yahweh’s burning anger.

Jer 12:14 Yahweh says this, “As regards all my evil neighbours who have laid hands on the heritage I granted
my people Israel, look, I shall uproot them from their soil, (though I shall uproot the House of Judah from among
them).

Jer 12:15 But having uprooted them, I shall take pity on them again and bring them back each to its own
heritage, each to its own country,

Jer 12:16 and if they carefully learn my people’s ways and swear by my name, ‘As Yahweh lives’, as they have
taught my people to swear by Baal, then they will be re-established among my people.

Jer 12:17 But if any nation refuses to listen, I shall uproot it for ever and destroy it, Yahweh declares”.

Jer 13:1 Yahweh said this to me, “Go and buy a linen waistcloth and put it round your waist. But do not dip it in
water”.

Jer 13:2 And so, as Yahweh had ordered, I bought a waistcloth and put it round my waist.

Jer 13:3 A second time the word of Yahweh came to me,

Jer 13:4 “Take the waistcloth that you have bought and are wearing round your waist. Up, go to the Euphrates
and hide it there in a hole in the rock”.



Jer 13:5 So I went and hid it by the Euphrates as Yahweh had ordered me.

Jer 13:6 A long time later, Yahweh said to me, “Up, go to the Euphrates and fetch the waistcloth I ordered you to
hide there”.

Jer 13:7 So I went to the Euphrates, and I searched, and I took the waistcloth from the place where I had hidden
it. And there was the waistcloth ruined, no use for anything.

Jer 13:8 Then the word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Jer 1 3:9 “Yahweh says this, ‘In the same way I shall ruin the pride of Judah, the immense pride of Jerusalem.
Jer 13:10 This evil people, these people who refuse to listen to my words, who follow their own stubborn
inclinations and run after other gods, serving and worshipping them — this people will become like this waistcloth,
no good for anything.

Jer 13:11 For just as a waistcloth clings to a man’s waist, so I made the whole House of Israel and the whole
House of Judah cling to me, Yahweh declares, to be my people, my glory, my honour and my pride. But they
have not listened’.

Jer 13:12 “You will also say this to them, ‘Yahweh, God of Israel, says this: Any jug can be filled with wine’. And
if they answer you, ‘Do you think we do not know that any jug can be filled with wine?’.

Jer 13:13 you are to say, ‘Yahweh says this: Look, I shall fill all the inhabitants of this country, the kings who
occupy the throne of David, the priests, the prophets and all the citizens of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.

Jer 13:14 Then I shall smash them one against the other, parents and children all together, Yahweh declares.
Mercilessly, relentlessly, pitilessly, I shall destroy them’”.

Jer 13:15 Listen and pay attention, do not be proud: Yahweh is speaking!

Jer 13:16 Give glory to Yahweh your God before the darkness comes, before your feet stumble on the darkened
mountains. You hope for light, but he will turn it to shadow dark as death, will change it to blackness.

Jer 13:17 If you do not listen to this warning, I shall weep in secret for your pride; my eyes will weep bitterly and
stream with tears, for Yahweh’s flock is being led into captivity.

Jer 13:18 Tell the king and the queen mother, “Sit in a lower place, since your glorious crown has fallen from
your head.

Jer 13:19 The towns of the Negeb are shut off with no one to give access to them. All Judah has been deported,
deported wholesale”.

Jer 13:20 Raise your eyes and look at these now coming from the north. Where is the flock once entrusted to
you, the flock which was your pride?

Jer 1 3:21 What will you say when they come and punish you, you yourself having taught them? Against you, in

the lead, will come your friends. Then will not anguish grip you as it grips a woman in labour?

Jer 1 3:22 And should you ask yourself, “Why is all this happening to me?”. it is because of your great guilt that
your skirts have been pulled up and you have been manhandled.

Jer 13:23 Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? And you, can you do right, being so
accustomed to wrong?

Jer 1 3:24 “I shall scatter you like chaff on the desert wind.

Jer 13:25 This is your share, the part allotted you, from me, Yahweh declares, because you have forgotten me

and put your trust in Delusion.

Jer 1 3:26 I am the one who pulls your skirts up over your face to let your shame be seen.

Jer 1 3:27 Oh! Your adulteries, your shrieks of pleasure, your vile prostitution! On the hills, in the fields, I have
seen your Horrors. Jerusalem, disaster is coming for you! How much longer till you are made clean?”.

Jer 14:1 The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah on the occasion of the drought.

Jer 14:2 “Judah is in mourning, her towns are pining, sinking to the ground; a cry goes up from Jerusalem.

Jer 14:3 The nobles send their servants for water, they come to the water-tanks, find no water, and return with
their pitchers empty. Dismayed and bewildered, they cover their heads.

Jer 14:4 Because the soil is all cracked since the country has had no rain; the farmers are dismayed, they cover
their heads.

Jer 14:5 Even the doe in the countryside giving birth abandons her young, for there is no grass;

Jer 14:6 the wild donkeys standing on the bare heights gasp for air like jackals: their eyes grow dim for lack of
pasture”.

Jer 14:7 Although our sins witness against us, Yahweh, for your name’s sake, intervene! Yes, our acts of
infidelity have been many, we have sinned against you!

Jer 14:8 Yahweh, hope of Israel, its Saviour in time of distress, why are you like a stranger in this country, like a
traveller staying only for one night?

Jer 14:9 Why are you like someöne bemused, like a warrior who has no power to rescue? And yet, Yahweh,
you are among us, we are called by your name. Do not desert us!

Jer 14:10 Yahweh says this about this people, “They take such pleasure in darting hither and thither, they
cannot restrain their feet! But Yahweh takes pleasure in them no longer; now he will keep their guilt in mind and



punish their sins”.

Jer 14:1 1 Yahweh then said to me, “Do not intercede for this people or their welfare.

Jer 14:12 If they fast, I will not listen to their plea; if they offer burnt offerings and cereal offerings I will not
accept them. Rather, I shall make an end of them by sword, famine and plague”.

Jer 14:13 “Ah, Lord Yahweh”, I answered, “here are the prophets telling them, ‘You will not see the sword,
famine will not touch you; I promise you true peace in this place’”.

Jer 14:14 Then Yahweh said to me, “The prophets are prophesying lies in my name; I have not sent them, I
gave them no orders, I never spoke to them. Delusive visions, hollow predictions, daydreams of their own, that is
what they prophesy to you.

Jer 14:15 Therefore, Yahweh says this: The prophets who prophesy in my name when I have not sent them,
and tell you there will be no sword or famine in this country, these same prophets will meet their end by sword
and famine.

Jer 14:16 And as for the people to whom they prophesy, they will be tossed into the streets of Jerusalem,
victims of famine and the sword, with not a soul to bury them: neither them nor their wives, nor their sons, nor
their daughters. I shall pour their own wickedness down on them.

Jer 14:17 “So say this word to them: May my eyes shed tears night and day, unceasingly, since the daughter of
my people has sustained a fearsome wound, a crippling injury.

Jer 14:18 If I go into the countryside, there lie those killed by the sword; if I go into the city, I see people tortured
with hunger; even prophets and priests roam the country at their wits’ end”.

Jer 14:19 Have you rejected Judah altogether? Does your very soul revolt at Zion? Why have you struck us
down without hope of cure? We were hoping for peace — no good came of it! For the moment of cure — nothing
but terror!

Jer 14:20 Yahweh, we acknowledge our wickedness and our ancestors’ guilt: we have indeed sinned against
you.

Jer 14:21 For your name’s sake do not reject us, do not dishonour the throne of your glory. Remember us; do
not break your covenant with us.

Jer 14:22 Can any of the nations’ Futile Ones make it rain? Can the heavens of their own accord give showers?
Are you not the one, Yahweh our God? In you is our hope, since you make all these things.

Jer 15:1 Yahweh said to me, “Even if Moses and Samuel pleaded before me, I could not sympathise with this
people! Drive them out of my sight; away with them!

Jer 15:2 And if they ask you, ‘Where shall we go?’. tell them this, ‘Yahweh says this: Those for the plague, to
the plague; those for the sword, to the sword; those for famine, to famine; those for captivity, to captivity!

Jer 15:3 ‘I shall consign them to four kinds of thing, Yahweh declares: the sword to kill, the dogs to drag away,
the birds of heaven and wild animals of earth to devour and to destroy.

Jer 1 5:4 I shall make them an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh son of
Hezekiah, king of Judah, and what he did in Jerusalem’”.

Jer 1 5:5 Who is there to pity you, Jerusalem, who to grieve for you, who to go out of his way and ask how you
are?

Jer 15:6 “You yourself have rejected me, Yahweh declares, you have turned your back on me; so I have
stretched my hand over you and destroyed you. Tired of relenting,

Jer 15:7 I have winnowed them with a winnow at the country’s gates. They have been bereft, I have destroyed
my people, but they refuse to leave their ways.

Jer 1 5:8 I have made their widows outnumber the sand of the sea. On the mother of young warriors I bring the
destroyer in broad daylight. Suddenly I bring anguish and terror down on her.

Jer 1 5:9 The mother of seven sons grows faint and gasps for breath. It is still day, but already her sun has set,
she is dismayed and distracted; and the rest of them I shall consign to the sword, to their enemies, Yahweh
declares”.

Jer 15:10 A disaster for me, mother, that you bore me to be a man of strife and dissension for the whole
country. I neither lend nor borrow, yet all of them curse me.

Jer 15:1 1 Have I not genuinely done my best to serve you, Yahweh? Have I not interceded with you in time of
disaster and distress!

Jer 15:12 “Can iron break the iron of the north and the bronze?

Jer 15:13 Your wealth and your treasures I shall hand over to plunder, without repayment, because of all your
sins, throughout your territory.

Jer 15:14 I shall enslave you to your enemies in a country which you do not know, for my anger has kindled a
fire that will burn you up”.

Jer 15:15 Yahweh, you know! Remember me, take care of me, and avenge me on my persecutors. However
long your anger endures, do not snatch me away. Realise that I suffer insult for your sake.

Jer 15:16 When your words came, I devoured them: your word was my delight and the joy of my heart; for I was



called by your Name, Yahweh, God Sabaoth.

Jer 15:17 I never sat in the company of scoffers amusing myself; with your hands on me I held myself aloof,
since you had filled me with indignation.

Jer 15:18 Why is my suffering continual, my wound incurable, refusing to be healed? Truly, for me you are a
deceptive stream with uncertain waters!

Jer 15:19 To which Yahweh replied, “If you repent, I shall restore you to plead before me. If you distinguish
between the precious and the base, you shall be as my own mouth. They will come back to you, but you must
not go back to them.

Jer 15:20 As far as these people are concerned, I shall make you a fortified wall of bronze. They will fight
against you but will not overcome you, because I am with you to save you and rescue you, Yahweh declares.

Jer 1 5:21 I shall rescue you from the clutches of the wicked and redeem you from the grasp of the violent”.

Jer 16:1 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows:

Jer 16:2 “You are not to marry or have sons and daughters in this place.

Jer 1 6:3 For Yahweh says this regarding the sons and daughters to be born in this place, about the mothers
who give birth to them, and about the fathers who beget them in this land,

Jer 1 6:4 ‘They will die of deadly diseases, unlamented and unburied; they will be like dung spread on the
ground; they will meet their end by sword and famine, and their corpses will be food for the birds of the sky and
the beasts of earth’.

Jer 1 6:5 “Yes, Yahweh says this, ‘Go into no house where there is mourning, do not go and lament or grieve
with them; for I have withdrawn my peace from this people, Yahweh declares, and faithful love and pity too.

Jer 16:6 High or low, they will die in this country, without burial or lament; there will be no gashing, no shaving of
the head for them.

Jer 1 6:7 No bread will be broken for the mourner to comfort him for the dead; no cup of consolation will be
offered him for his father or his mother.

Jer 1 6:8 ‘And do not enter a house where there is feasting, to sit with them and eat and drink.

Jer 1 6:9 For Yahweh Sabaoth, the God of Israel, says this: In this place, before your eyes, in your own days, I
will silence the shouts of rejoicing and mirth and the voices of bridegroom and bride.

Jer 16:10 ‘When you tell these people this and they ask you: Why has Yahweh decreed such complete and
total disaster for us? What have we done wrong? What sin have we committed against Yahweh our God?

Jer 16:1 1 then you are to answer: It is because your ancestors abandoned me, Yahweh declares, and followed
other gods, and served and worshipped them. They abandoned me and did not keep my Law.

Jer 16:12 And you for your part have behaved even worse than your ancestors. Look, each of you follows his
own stubborn and wicked inclinations, without listening to me.

Jer 16:13 And so, I shall eject you from this country into a country unknown to you or to your ancestors, and
there you can serve other gods, day and night, for I shall show you no more favour’.

Jer 16:14 “Look, the days are coming, Yahweh declares, when people will no longer say, ‘As Yahweh lives who
brought the Israelites out of Egypt!’.

Jer 16:15 but, ‘As Yahweh lives who brought the Israelites back from the land of the north and all the countries
to which he had driven them’. I shall bring them back to the very soil I gave their ancestors”.

Jer 16:16 “Watch, I shall send for many fishermen, Yahweh declares, and these will fish them up; next, I shall
send for many huntsmen, and these will hunt them out of every mountain, every hill, and out of the holes in the
rocks.

Jer 16:17 For my eyes watch all their ways, these are not hidden from me, and their guilt does not escape my
gaze.

Jer 16:18 I shall requite their guilt and their sin twice over, since they have polluted my country with the
carcases of their Horrors, and filled my heritage with their Abominations”.

Jer 16:19 Yahweh, my strength, my stronghold, my refuge in time of distress! To you the nations will come from
the remotest parts of the earth and say, “Our fathers inherited nothing but Delusion, Futility of no use whatever.
Jer 16:20 Can human beings make their own gods? These are not gods at all!”.

Jer 16:21 “Now listen, I will make them acknowledge, this time I will make them acknowledge my hand and my
might; and then they will know that Yahweh is my name”.

Jer 17:1 “The sin of Judah is written with an iron pen, engraved with a diamond point on the tablet of the heart
and on the horns of their altars,

Jer 17:2 while their children remember their altars and their sacred pole beside the green trees, on the lofty hills.
Jer 17:3 My mountain on the plain, your wealth and all your treasures I shall hand over to be plundered,
because of the sin of your high places throughout your territory.

Jer 17:4 You will have to relinquish your heritage which I gave you; I will enslave you to your enemies in a
country which you do not know, for my fiery anger kindled by you will burn for ever”.

Jer 17:5 Yahweh says this, “Accursed be anyone who trusts in human beings, who relies on human strength



and whose heart turns from Yahweh.

Jer 17:6 Such a person is like scrub in the wastelands: when good comes, it does not affect him since he lives
in the parched places of the desert, uninhabited, salt land.

Jer 17:7 “Blessed is anyone who trusts in Yahweh, with Yahweh to rely on.

Jer 17:8 Such a person is like a tree by the waterside that thrusts its roots to the stream: when the heat comes it
has nothing to fear, its foliage stays green; untroubled in a year of drought, it never stops bearing fruit.

Jer 17:9 The heart is more devious than any other thing, and is depraved; who can pierce its secrets?

Jer 17:10 I, Yahweh, search the heart, test the motives, to give each person what his conduct and his actions
deserve.

Jer 17:11 “The partridge will hatch eggs it has not laid. No different is the person who gets riches unjustly: his
days half done, they will desert him and he prove a fool after all”.

Jer 17:12 A glorious throne, sublime from the beginning, such is our Holy Place.

Jer 17:13 Yahweh, hope of Israel, all who abandon you will be put to shame, those who turn from you will be

registered in the underworld, since they have abandoned Yahweh, the fountain of living water.

Jer 17:14 Heal me, Yahweh, and I shall be healed, save me, and I shall be saved, for you are my praise.

Jer 17:15 Look, they keep saying to me, “Where is Yahweh’s word? Let it come true then!”.

Jer 17:16 Yet I have never urged you to send disaster, I never desired the fatal day, this you know; what came

from my lips was not concealed from you.

Jer 17:17 Do not be a terror to me, you, my refuge in time of disaster.

Jer 17:18 Let my persecutors be confounded, not me, let them, not me, be terrified. On them bring the day of
disaster, destroy them, destroy them twice over!

Jer 17:19 Yahweh said this to me, “Go and stand at the Gate of the Sons of the People by which the kings of
Judah go in and out — and at all the gates of Jerusalem.

Jer 17:20 Say to them, ‘Listen to the word of Yahweh, you kings of Judah, all you people of Judah too, and all
you inhabitants of Jerusalem who pass through the gates.

Jer 17:21 Yahweh says this: As you value your lives, on no account carry a burden on the Sabbath day or bring
it in through the gates of Jerusalem.

Jer 17:22 Bring no burden out of your houses on the Sabbath day, and do no work. Keep the Sabbath day holy,
as I ordered your ancestors.

Jer 17:23 They would not hear, would not pay attention; they deliberately refused to listen or accept instruction.
Jer 17:24 But if you listen carefully to me, Yahweh declares, and bring no burden in through the gates of this city
on the Sabbath day, if you keep the Sabbath holy and do no work on that day,

Jer 17:25 then, through the gates of this city, kings and princes occupying the throne of David will continue to
make their entry, riding in chariots or on horseback, they, their chief men, the people of Judah and the
inhabitants of Jerusalem. And this city will be inhabited for ever.

Jer 17:26 They will come from the towns of Judah, from the districts round Jerusalem, from the territory of
Benjamin, from the lowlands, from the highlands, from the Negeb, to offer burnt offering and sacrifice, and cereal
offering and incense, to offer thanksgiving sacrifices in the Temple of Yahweh.

Jer 17:27 But if you do not listen to me to keep the Sabbath day holy, and to refrain from entering the gates of
Jerusalem with burdens on the Sabbath day, then I shall set fire to its gates; fire will devour the palaces of
Jerusalem and not be quenched’”.

Jer 18:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh as follows,

Jer 1 8:2 “Get up and make your way down to the potter’s house, and there I shall tell you what I have to say”.

Jer 18:3 So I went down to the potter’s house; and there he was, working at the wheel.

Jer 1 8:4 But the vessel he was making came out wrong, as may happen with clay when a potter is at work. So
he began again and shaped it into another vessel, as he thought fit.

Jer 18:5 Then the word of Yahweh came to me as follows,

Jer 18:6 “House of Israel, can I not do to you what this potter does? Yahweh demands. Yes, like clay in the
potter’s hand, so you are in mine, House of Israel.

Jer 18:7 Sometimes I announce that I shall uproot, break down and destroy a certain nation or kingdom,

Jer 18:8 but should the nation I have threatened abandon its wickedness, I then change my mind about the
disaster which I had intended to inflict on it.

Jer 18:9 Sometimes I announce that I shall build up and plant a certain nation or kingdom,

Jer 18:10 but should that nation do what displeases me and refuse to listen to my voice, I then change my mind
about the good which I was intending to confer on it.

Jer 18:1 1 So now, say this to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, ‘Yahweh says this: Listen, I
am preparing a disaster for you, I am working out a plan against you. So now, each one of you, turn back from
your evil ways, amend your conduct and actions’.

Jer 18:12 They, however, will say, ‘It is no use! We shall follow our own plans; each of us will act on his own



wicked inclinations’”.

Jer 18:13 Therefore, Yahweh says this, “Ask, please, among the nations if anyone has heard anything like this.
The Virgin of Israel has done a very horrible thing.

Jer 18:14 Does the snow of Lebanon ever leave the rocks of its slopes? Do the rivers of foreign lands, their cold
flowing waters, ever run dry?

Jer 18:15 And yet my people have forgotten me! They burn incense to a Nothing! They have been made to
stumble in their ways, the ancient paths, to walk in paths, on an unmade road,

Jer 18:16 to make their country an object of horror, everlastingly derided: every passer-by will be appalled at it
and shake his head.

Jer 18:17 Like the east wind, I shall scatter them before the enemy. I shall show them my back, not my face, the
day they are ruined”.

Jer 18:18 “Come on”, they said, “let us concoct a plot against Jeremiah, for the Law will not perish for lack of
priests, nor advice for lack of wise men, nor the word for lack of prophets. Come on, let us slander him and pay
no attention to anything he says”.

Jer 18:19 Pay attention to me, Yahweh, hear what my adversaries are saying.

Jer 1 8:20 Should evil be returned for good? Now they are digging a pit for me. Remember how I pleaded before
you and spoke good of them, to turn your retribution away from them.

Jer 1 8:21 So, hand their sons over to famine, abandon them to the edge of the sword. Let their wives become
childless and widowed. Let their husbands die of plague, their young men be cut down by the sword in battle.

Jer 18:22 Let cries re-echo from their houses as you bring raiders suddenly on them. For they have dug a pit to
catch me, they have laid snares to trap my feet.

Jer 1 8:23 But you, Yahweh, know all about their murderous plot against me. Do not forgive their guilt, do not
efface their sin from your sight. Let them be hurled down before you, deal with them while you are angry!

Jer 19:1 Then Yahweh said to Jeremiah, “Go and buy a potter’s earthenware jug. Take some of the people’s
elders and some of the senior priests with you.

Jer 1 9:2 Go out towards the Valley of Ben-Hinnom, just outside the Gate of the Potsherds. There proclaim the
words I shall say to you.

Jer 19:3 You must say, ‘Kings of Judah, inhabitants of Jerusalem! Listen to the word of Yahweh! Yahweh
Sabaoth, the God of Israel, says this: I am about to bring such a disaster on this place that the ears of every one
who hears of it will ring.

Jer 19:4 For they have abandoned me and have made this place unrecognisable, and offered incense here to
other gods which neither they nor their ancestors nor the kings of Judah ever knew before. They have filled this
place with the blood of the innocent;

Jer 1 9:5 for they have built high places for Baal to burn their sons as burnt offerings to Baal, a thing I never
ordered, never mentioned, that had never entered my thoughts.

Jer 19:6 So now the days are coming, Yahweh declares, when people will no longer call this place Topheth, or
Valley of Ben-Hinnom, but Valley of Slaughter.

Jer 19:7 Because of this place, I shall empty Judah and Jerusalem of sound advice; I shall make them fall by
the sword before their enemies, by the hand of those determined to kill them; I shall give their corpses as food to
the birds of the sky and the animals of earth.

Jer 19:8 And I shall make this city an object of horror and derision; every passer-by will be appalled at it and
whistle at the sight of all the wounds it has sustained.

Jer 1 9:9 I shall make them eat the flesh of their own sons and daughters: they will eat one another during the
siege, in the shortage to which their enemies, and those determined to kill them, will reduce them’.

Jer 19:10 “You must break this jug in front of the men who are with you,

Jer 19:1 1 and say to them, ‘Yahweh Sabaoth says this: I am going to break this people and this city just as one
breaks a potter’s pot, so that it can never be mended again. ‘Topheth will become a burial ground, for lack of
other burial space.

Jer 19:12 That is how I shall treat this place, Yahweh declares, and its inhabitants, by making this city like
Topheth.

Jer 19:13 The houses of Jerusalem and those of the kings of Judah, all the houses on the roofs of which they
offered incense to the whole array of heaven and poured libations to other gods, will be unclean, like this place
Topheth’”.

Jer 19:14 Jeremiah then came back from Topheth where Yahweh had sent him to prophesy, and stood in the
court of the Temple of Yahweh and said to all the people,

Jer 19:15 “Yahweh Sabaoth, the God of Israel, says this, ‘Yes, on this city, and on all the towns belonging to it, I
shall bring all the disaster which I had decreed for it, since they have stubbornly refused to listen to my words’”.
Jer 20:1 Now the priest Pashhur son of Immer, who was the chief of police in the Temple of Yahweh, heard
Jeremiah making this prophecy.



Jer 20:2 Pashhur struck the prophet Jeremiah and then put him in the stocks, in the Upper Benjamin Gate
leading into the Temple of Yahweh.

Jer 20:3 Next day, Pashhur had Jeremiah taken out of the stocks; Jeremiah then said to him, “Not Pashhur but
Terror-on-every-Side is Yahweh’s name for you.

Jer 20:4 For Yahweh says this, ‘I am going to hand you over to terror, you and all your friends; they will fall by
the sword of their enemies, your own eyes will see it. The whole of Judah, too, I shall hand over to the king of
Babylon; he will carry them off captive to Babylon and put them to the sword.

Jer 20:5 And all the wealth of this city, all its stores, all its valuables, all the treasures of the kings of Judah, I
shall hand over to their enemies who will plunder them, round them up and carry them off to Babylon.

Jer 20:6 As for you, Pashhur, and your whole household, you will go into captivity; you will go to Babylon; there
you will die, and there be buried, you and all your friends to whom you have prophesied lies’. 1
Jer 20:7 You have seduced me, Yahweh, and I have let myself be seduced; you have overpowered me: you
were the stronger. I am a laughing-stock all day long, they all make fun of me.

Jer 20:8 For whenever I speak, I have to howl and proclaim, “Violence and ruin!”. For me, Yahweh’s word has
been the cause of insult and derision all day long.

Jer 20:9 I would say to myself, “I will not think about him, I will not speak in his name any more”, but then there
seemed to be a fire burning in my heart, imprisoned in my bones. The effort to restrain it wearied me, I could not
do it.

Jer 20:10 I heard so many disparaging me, “Terror on every side! Denounce him! Let us denounce him!”. All
those who were on good terms with me watched for my downfall, “Perhaps he will be seduced into error. Then
we shall get the better of him and take our revenge!”.

Jer 20:1 1 But Yahweh is at my side like a mighty hero; my opponents will stumble, vanquished, confounded by
their failure; everlasting, unforgettable disgrace will be theirs.

Jer 20:12 Yahweh Sabaoth, you who test the upright, observer of motives and thoughts, I shall see your
vengeance on them, for I have revealed my cause to you.

Jer 20:13 Sing to Yahweh, praise Yahweh, for he has delivered the soul of one in need from the clutches of evil
doers.

Jer 20:14 A curse on the day when I was born! May the day my mother bore me be unblessed!

Jer 20:15 A curse on the man who brought my father the news, “A son, a boy has been born to you!”. making him
overjoyed.

Jer 20:16 May this man be like the towns that Yahweh overthrew without mercy; may he hear the warning-cry at
dawn and the shout of battle at high noon,

Jer 20:17 for not killing me in the womb; my mother would have been my grave and her womb pregnant for
ever.

Jer 20:18 Why ever did I come out of the womb to see toil and sorrow and end my days in shame?

Jer 21:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh when King Zedekiah sent Pashhur son of Malchiah to
him, with the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah, to say this,

Jer 21 :2 “Please consult Yahweh for us, since Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is making war on us: perhaps
Yahweh will work one of his many miracles for us and force him to withdraw”.

Jer 21 :3 Jeremiah said to them, “Take this answer to Zedekiah,

Jer 21 :4 ‘Yahweh, God of Israel, says this: I shall bring back the weapons of war which you are now carrying,
and with which you are fighting the king of Babylon and the Chaldaeans now besieging you; from outside the
walls, I shall stack them in the centre of this city.

Jer 21 :5 And I shall fight against you myself with outstretched hand and mighty arm, in anger, fury and great
wrath.

Jer 21 :6 I shall strike down the inhabitants of this city, human and animal; they will die of a great plague.

Jer 21 :7 Then, Yahweh declares, I shall deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, his officials, the people and those of
this city who have escaped the plague, the sword, or the famine, into the clutches of Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon, into the clutches of their enemies and into the clutches of those determined to kill them; mercilessly,
relentlessly, pitilessly, he will put them to the sword’.

Jer 21 :8 “And you must say to this people, ‘Yahweh says this: Look, I offer you a choice between the way of life
and the way of death.

Jer 21 :9 Anyone who stays in this city will die by sword, by famine, or by plague; but anyone who leaves it and
surrenders to the Chaldaeans now besieging you will live; he will escape with his life.

Jer 21:10 For I am determined on disaster, and not prosperity, for this city, Yahweh declares. It will be handed
over to the king of Babylon, and he will burn it down’”.

Jer 21:11 To the royal House of Judah. Listen to the word of Yahweh,

Jer 21:12 House of David! Yahweh says this: Each morning give fair judgement, rescue anyone who has been
wronged from the hands of his oppressor, or else my wrath will leap out like a fire, it will burn and no one will be



able to quench it, because of the wickedness of your actions.

Jer 21:13 My quarrel is with you, resident of the valley, Rock-in-the-Plain, Yahweh declares, with you that say,
“Who would dare attack us and enter our lairs?”.

Jer 21:14 I shall punish you as your actions deserve, Yahweh declares, I shall set fire to its forest and it will
devour all around it.

Jer 22:1 Yahweh said this, “Go down to the palace of the king of Judah and there say this word,

Jer 22:2 ‘Listen to the word of Yahweh, king of Judah now occupying the throne of David, you, your officials and
your people who go through these gates.

Jer 22:3 Yahweh says this: Act uprightly and justly; rescue from the hands of the oppressor anyone who has
been wronged, do not exploit or ill-treat the stranger, the orphan, the widow; shed no innocent blood in this
place.

Jer 22:4 For if you are scrupulous in obeying this command, then kings occupying the throne of David will
continue to make their entry through the gates of this palace riding in chariots or on horseback, they, their
officials and their people.

Jer 22:5 But if you do not listen to these words, then I swear by myself, Yahweh declares, this palace shall
become a ruin!

Jer 22:6 ‘Yes, this is what Yahweh says about the palace of the king of Judah: You are like Gilead to me, like a
peak of Lebanon. All the same, I will reduce you to a desert, to uninhabited towns.

Jer 22:7 I dedicate men to destroy you, each man with his weapons; they will cut down your finest cedars and
throw them on the fire.

Jer 22:8 ‘And when many nations pass this city, they will say to one another: Why has Yahweh treated this
great city like this?

Jer 22:9 And the answer will be: Because they abandoned the covenant of Yahweh their God to worship other
gods and serve them’”.

Jer 22:10 Do not weep for the man who is dead, do not raise the dirge for him. Weep rather for the one who has
gone away, since he will never come back, never see his native land again.

Jer 22:1 1 For this is what Yahweh has said about Shallum son of Josiah, king of Judah, who succeeded Josiah
his father and was forced to leave this place, “He will never come back to it

Jer 22:12 but will die in the place to which he has been taken captive; and he will never see this country again.
Jer 22:13 “Disaster for the man who builds his house without uprightness, his upstairs rooms without fair
judgement, who makes his fellow-man work for nothing, without paying him his wages,

Jer 22:14 who says, ‘I shall build myself a spacious palace with airy upstairs rooms’, who makes windows in it,
panels it with cedar, and paints it vermilion.

Jer 22:15 Are you more of a king because of your passion for cedar? Did your father go hungry or thirsty? But
he did what is just and upright, so all went well for him.

Jer 22:16 He used to examine the cases of poor and needy, then all went well. Is not that what it means to know
me? Yahweh demands.

Jer 22:17 You on the other hand have eyes and heart for nothing but your own interests, for shedding innocent
blood and perpetrating violence and oppression”.

Jer 22:18 That is why Yahweh says this about Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah: “No lamenting for him,
‘My poor brother! My poor sister!’. No lamenting for him, ‘His poor lordship! His poor majesty!’.

Jer 22:19 He will have a donkey’s funeral - dragged away and thrown out of the gates of Jerusalem”.

Jer 22:20 “Climb the Lebanon range and shriek, raise your voice in Bashan, shriek from the Abarim, for all your
lovers have been ruined!

Jer 22:21 I spoke to you in your prosperity, but you said, ‘I will not listen!’. From your youth this has been how
you behaved, refusing to listen to my voice.

Jer 22:22 The wind will shepherd all your shepherds away and your lovers will go into captivity. Then you will
blush deep with shame at the thought of all your wickedness.

Jer 22:23 You who have made the Lebanon your home and made your nest among the cedars, how you will
groan when anguish overtakes you, pangs like those of a woman in labour!

Jer 22:24 “As I live, Yahweh declares, even if Coniah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were the signet ring on
my right hand, I would still wrench you off!

Jer 22:25 I shall hand you over to those determined to kill you, to those you dread, to Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon, to the Chaldaeans.

Jer 22:26 I shall hurl you and the mother who bore you into another country; you were not born there but you
will both die there.

Jer 22:27 They will not return to the country to which they desperately long to return”.

Jer 22:28 Is he a shoddy broken pot, this man Coniah, a crock that no one wants? Why are he and his offspring
ejected, hurled into a country they know nothing of?



Jer 22:29 O land, land, land, listen to the word of Yahweh!

Jer 22:30 Yahweh says this, “List this man as: Childless; a man who made a failure of his life, since none of his
offspring will succeed in occupying the throne of David, or ruling in Judah again”.

Jer 23:1 “Disaster for the shepherds who lose and scatter the sheep of my pasture, Yahweh declares.

Jer 23:2 This, therefore, is what Yahweh, God of Israel, says about the shepherds who shepherd my people,
‘You have scattered my flock, you have driven them away and have not taken care of them. Right, I shall take
care of you for your misdeeds, Yahweh declares!

Jer 23:3 But the remnant of my flock I myself shall gather from all the countries where I have driven them, and
bring them back to their folds; they will be fruitful and increase in numbers.

Jer 23:4 For them I shall raise up shepherds to shepherd them and pasture them. No fear, no terror for them
any more; not one shall be lost, Yahweh declares!

Jer 23:5 Look, the days are coming, Yahweh declares, when I shall raise an upright Branch for David; he will
reign as king and be wise, doing what is just and upright in the country.

Jer 23:6 In his days Judah will triumph and Israel live in safety. And this is the name he will be called, “Yahweh-
is-our-Saving-Justice”. ‘

Jer 23:7 “So, look, the days are coming, Yahweh declares, when people will no longer say, ‘As Yahweh lives
who brought the Israelites out of Egypt’,

Jer 23:8 but, ‘As Yahweh lives who led back and brought home the offspring of the House of Israel from the
land of the north and all the countries to which he had driven them, to live on their own soil’”.

Jer 23:9 On the prophets. My heart is broken within me, I tremble in all my bones; I am like a drunken man, like
a man overcome with wine, because of Yahweh and his holy words:

Jer 23:10 “For the country is full of adulterers; yes, because of a curse, the country is in mourning and the
pasturage in the desert has dried up; they are prompt to do wrong, make no effort to do right.

Jer 23:1 1 Yes, even prophet and priest are godless, I have detected their wickedness in my own House,

Yahweh declares.

Jer 23:12 Because of this, their way will prove treacherous going for them; in the darkness where they are
driven, there they will fall. For I shall bring disaster on them, when the year for punishing them comes, Yahweh
declares.

Jer 23:13 “In the prophets of Samaria I have seen insanity: they prophesied in the name of Baal and led my
people Israel astray.

Jer 23:14 But in the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen something horrible: adultery, persistent lying, such
abetting of the wicked that no one renounces his wickedness. To me they are all like Sodom and its inhabitants
are like Gomorrah.

Jer 23:15 So this is what Yahweh Sabaoth says about the prophets, ‘Now I shall give them wormwood to eat
and make them drink poisoned water, since from the prophets of Jerusalem godlessness has spread throughout
the land’.

Jer 23:16 “Yahweh Sabaoth says this, ‘Do not listen to what those prophets prophesy to you; they are deluding
you, they retail visions of their own, and not what comes from Yahweh’s mouth.

Jer 23:17 To those who despise me, they keep saying: Yahweh has spoken: you will have peace! and to all who
follow their own stubborn inclinations: No disaster will touch you’.

Jer 23:18 But who has been present in Yahweh’s council and seen, and heard his word? Who has paid
attention to his word and listened to it?

Jer 23:19 Look, Yahweh’s hurricane, his wrath, bursts out, a fearsome hurricane, to burst on the heads of the
wicked;

Jer 23:20 Yahweh’s anger will not withdraw until he has performed, has carried out, what he has in mind. In the
final days, you will understand this clearly,

Jer 23:21 “I did not send these prophets, yet they ran! I did not speak to them, yet they prophesied!

Jer 23:22 Had they been present in my council, they could have proclaimed my words to my people and turned
them from their evil way and from the wickedness of their deeds!

Jer 23:23 “Am I a God when near, Yahweh demands, and not a God when far away?

Jer 23:24 Can anyone hide somewhere secret without my seeing him? Yahweh demands. Do I not fill heaven
and earth? Yahweh demands.

Jer 23:25 “I have heard what the prophets say who make their lying prophecies in my name. ‘I have had a
dream’, they say, ‘I have had a dream!’.

Jer 23:26 How long are there to be those among the prophets who prophesy lies and are in fact prophets of
their own delusions?

Jer 23:27 They are doing their best, by means of the dreams that they keep telling each other, to make my
people forget my name, just as their ancestors forgot my name in favour of Baal.

Jer 23:28 Let the prophet who has had a dream tell it for a dream! And let him who receives a word from me,



deliver my word accurately! “What have straw and wheat in common? Yahweh demands.

Jer 23:29 Is my word not like fire, Yahweh demands, is it not like a hammer shattering a rock?

Jer 23:30 “So, then, I have a quarrel with the prophets, Yahweh declares, that steal my words from one another.
Jer 23:31 I have a quarrel with the prophets, Yahweh declares, who wag their tongues to utter prophecies.

Jer 23:32 I have a quarrel with the prophets who make prophecies out of lying dreams, Yahweh declares, who
recount them, and lead my people astray by their lies and their bragging. I certainly never sent them or
commissioned them, and they serve no good purpose for this people, Yahweh declares.

Jer 23:33 “And when this people, or a prophet, or a priest, asks you, ‘What is Yahweh’s burden?’. you must
answer, ‘You are the burden, and I shall get rid of you, Yahweh declares!’.

Jer 23:34 “As for the prophet, the priest, or anyone else, who says, ‘Yahweh’s burden’, I shall punish that man,
and his household too.

Jer 23:35 This is what you must say to one another, among yourselves, ‘What answer has Yahweh given?’. or
‘What has Yahweh said?’.

Jer 23:36 But stop using the expression ‘Yahweh’s burden’, for what each man says will be his own
responsibility. And you twist the words of the living God, of Yahweh Sabaoth, our God.

Jer 23:37 This is the way to speak to a prophet, ‘What answer has Yahweh given?’. or ‘What has Yahweh
said?’.

Jer 23:38 But if you say, ‘Yahweh’s burden’, then Yahweh says this, ‘Since you use the expression “Yahweh’s
burden”, when I have warned you to stop saying, “Yahweh’s burden”,

Jer 23:39 believe me, I shall pick you up and fling you from my presence, you and the city I gave to you and to
your ancestors.

Jer 23:40 I shall bring down everlasting shame on you, everlasting and unforgettable disgrace’”.

Jer 24:1 Yahweh gave me a vision: set out in front of the Temple of Yahweh were two baskets of figs. This was
after Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had led Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, away into exile from
Jerusalem, with the chief men of Judah, the blacksmiths and metalworkers, and had taken them to Babylon.

Jer 24:2 One basket contained excellent figs, like those that ripen first; the other contained very bad figs, so bad
they were uneatable.

Jer 24:3 Yahweh said to me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?”. “Figs”, I answered, “the good ones excellent, the bad
ones very bad, so bad as to be uneatable”.

Jer 24:4 Then the word of Yahweh was addressed to me,

Jer 24:5 “Yahweh, the God of Israel, says this, ‘As these figs are good, so I mean to concern myself with the
welfare of the exiles of Judah whom I have sent from this place to the country of the Chaldaeans.

Jer 24:6 My eyes will watch over them for their good, to bring them back to this country, to build them up and
not to break them down, to plant them and not to uproot them.

Jer 24:7 I shall give them a heart to acknowledge that I am Yahweh. They will be my people and I shall be their
God, for they will return to me with all their heart.

Jer 24:8 As for the bad figs, the figs so bad as to be uneatable-yes, Yahweh says this — that is how I shall treat
Zedekiah king of Judah, his chief men and what is left of Jerusalem, those who remain in this country and those
living in Egypt.

Jer 24:9 I shall make them an object of horror, a disaster, to all the kingdoms of the earth, a thing of shame, a
byword, a laughing-stock, a curse, wherever I shall drive them.

Jer 24:10 Sword, famine and plague I shall send against them until they have vanished from the soil I gave to
them and to their ancestors’”.

Jer 25:1 The word that was addressed to Jeremiah about all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim
son of Josiah, king of Judah (that is to say the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon).

Jer 25:2 The prophet Jeremiah proclaimed it before all the people of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem:
Jer 25:3 “For twenty-three years, from the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah, until today, the
word of Yahweh has been addressed to me and I have never tired of speaking to you (but you have not listened.
Jer 25:4 Furthermore, Yahweh has untiringly sent you all his servants the prophets, but you have not listened or
paid attention).

Jer 25:5 The message was this, ‘T urn back, each one of you, from your evil behaviour and your evil actions,
and you will go on living on the soil Yahweh long ago gave to you and your ancestors for ever.

Jer 25:6 (And do not follow other gods to serve and worship them, do not provoke me with things you
yourselves have made, and then I shall not harm you.)

Jer 25:7 But you have not listened to me (Yahweh declares, so that you have now provoked me with things you
yourselves have made, and thus harmed yourselves)’.

Jer 25:8 “So-this is what Yahweh Sabaoth says, ‘Since you have not listened to my words,

Jer 25:9 I shall now send for all the families of the north (Yahweh declares, that is, for Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon, my servant) and bring them down on this country and its inhabitants (and on all these surrounding



nations); I shall curse them with utter destruction and make them an object of horror, of scorn, and ruin them for
ever.

Jer 25:10 From them I shall banish the shouts of rejoicing and mirth, the voices of bridegroom and bride, the
sound of the handmill and the light of the lamp;

Jer 25:1 1 and this whole country will be reduced to ruin and desolation, and these nations will be enslaved to
the king of Babylon for seventy years.

Jer 25:12 (But when the seventy years are over, I shall punish the king of Babylon and that nation, Yahweh
declares, for the wrong they have done, that is, the country of the Chaldaeans, and make it desolate for ever),
Jer 25:13 and against that country I shall perform all the words with which I have threatened it, that is,
everything written in this book’”.

Jer 25:14 What Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations. ('For these in their turn are to be enslaved to
powerful nations and great kings, and I shall pay them back as their deeds and handiwork deserve.')

Jer 25:15 For Yahweh, the God of Israel, said this to me, “Take this cup of the wine of wrath and make all the
nations to whom I send you drink it;

Jer 25:16 they will drink and reel and lose their wits, because of the sword I am sending among them”.

Jer 25:17 I took the cup from Yahweh’s hand and made all the nations to whom Yahweh sent me drink it
Jer 25:18 (Jerusalem and the towns of Judah, its kings and its chief men, to make them a ruin, an object of
horror and derision and a curse, as is the case today):

Jer 25:19 Pharaoh king of Egypt, his officials, his chief men and all his people,

Jer 25:20 with the whole conglomeration of peoples there (all the kings of the country of Uz); all the kings of the
country of the Philistines, Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron and what is still left of Ashdod;

Jer 25:21 Edom, Moab and the Ammonites;

Jer 25:22 (all) the kings of Tyre, (all) the kings of Sidon, the kings of the island across the sea;

Jer 25:23 Dedan, Tema, Buz, all the people with shaven temples;

Jer 25:24 all the kings of Arabia (and all the kings of the conglomeration of peoples) who live in the desert
Jer 25:25 (all the kings of Zimri), all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media;

Jer 25:26 all the kings of the north, near and far, one after another: in short, all the kingdoms on the face of the
earth. (As for the king of Sheshak, he will drink last of all.)

Jer 25:27 “You will say to them, ‘Yahweh Sabaoth, the God of Israel, says this: Drink! Get drunk! Vomit! Fall,
never to rise again, before the sword that I am sending among you!’.

Jer 25:28 If they refuse to take the cup from your hand and drink, you will say to them, ‘Yahweh Sabaoth says
this: You must drink!

Jer 25:29 Look, for a start, I am bringing disaster on the city that bears my name, so are you likely to go
unpunished? You certainly will not go unpunished, for next I shall summon a sword against all the inhabitants of
the land, Yahweh declares’.

Jer 25:30 “For your part, you are to prophesy all these words to them. Say to them: ‘Yahweh roars from on high,
he thunders from his holy dwelling-place, loudly he roars at his own fold, shouts aloud like those who tread the
grape at all the inhabitants of the land.

Jer 25:31 The noise resounds to the remotest parts of the earth. For Yahweh is indicting the nations, arraigning
all humanity for judgement; the wicked he assigns to the sword, Yahweh declares.

Jer 25:32 Yahweh Sabaoth says this: Look, disaster is spreading from nation to nation, a mighty tempest is
rising from the far ends of the earth.

Jer 25:33 ‘Those slaughtered by Yahweh that day will be scattered across the world from end to end. No dirge
will be raised for them; no one will gather them or bury them; they will stay lying on the surface like dung.

Jer 25:34 ‘Howl, shepherds, shriek, roll on the ground, you lords of the flock, for your days have come to be
slaughtered and to be scattered, and like a choice vase you will fall.

Jer 25:35 No refuge then for the shepherds, no escape for the lords of the flock!

Jer 25:36 Listen! A shriek from the shepherds, a howl from the lords of the flock! For Yahweh has laid their

pasture waste,

Jer 25:37 the peaceful sheepfolds are reduced to silence owing to Yahweh’s furious anger.

Jer 25:38 The lion has left his lair and their country is a wasteland now, owing to the devastating fury, owing to

his furious anger’”.

Jer 26:1 At the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah
from Yahweh,

Jer 26:2 “Yahweh says this, ‘Stand in the court of the Temple of Yahweh. To all the people from the towns of
Judah who come to worship in the Temple of Yahweh you will say everything I have ordered you to say, not
omitting one syllable.

Jer 26:3 Perhaps they will listen and each turn from his evil way: if so, I shall relent and not bring the disaster on
them which I intend because of their misdeeds’.



Jer 26:4 Say to them, ‘Yahweh says this: If you will not listen to me and follow my Law which I have given you,
Jer 26:5 and pay attention to the words of my servants the prophets whom I have never tired of sending to you,
although you never have paid attention,

Jer 26:6 I shall treat this Temple as I treated Shiloh, and make this city a curse for all the nations of the world’”.
Jer 26:7 The priests and prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah say these words in the Temple of Yahweh.
Jer 26:8 When Jeremiah had finished saying everything that Yahweh had ordered him to say to all the people,
the priests and prophets and all the people seized hold of him and said, “You will die for this!

Jer 26:9 Why have you made this prophecy in Yahweh’s name, ‘This Temple will become like Shiloh, and this
city become an uninhabited ruin” 1 ?”. And the people all crowded in on Jeremiah in the Temple of Yahweh.

Jer 26:10 Hearing of this, the chief men of Judah came up from the royal palace to the Temple of Yahweh and
took their seats at the entry of the New Gate of the Temple of Yahweh.

Jer 26:1 1 The priests and prophets then said to the chief men and all the people, “This man deserves to die,
since he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your own ears”.

Jer 26:12 Jeremiah, however, replied to all the chief men and all the people as follows, “Yahweh himself sent
me to prophesy against this Temple and this city all the things you have heard.

Jer 26:13 So now amend your behaviour and actions, listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, and Yahweh will
relent about the disaster that he has decreed for you.

Jer 26:14 For myself, I am, as you see, in your hands. Do whatever you please or think right with me.

Jer 26:15 But be sure of this, that if you put me to death, you will be bringing innocent blood on yourselves, on
this city and on its inhabitants, since Yahweh has truly sent me to you to say all this for you to hear”.

Jer 26:16 The chief men and all the people then said to the priests and prophets, “This man does not deserve to
die: he has spoken to us in the name of Yahweh our God”.

Jer 26:17 And some of the country’s elders rose to address all the assembled people.

Jer 26:18 “Micah of Moresheth”, they said, “who prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, had this to
say to all the people of Judah, ‘Yahweh Sabaoth says this: Zion will become ploughland, Jerusalem a heap of
rubble and the Temple Mount a wooded height’.

Jer 26:19 “Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death for this? Did they not rather, fearing
Yahweh, plead with him, to such effect that Yahweh relented about the disaster which he had decreed for them?
Are we now to burden our souls with such a crime?”.

Jer 26:20 There was another man, too, who used to prophesy in Yahweh’s name, Uriah son of Shemaiah, from
Kiriath-Jearim. He prophesied exactly the same things against this city and this country as Jeremiah.

Jer 26:21 When King Jehoiakim with all his officers and all the chief men heard what he said, the king was
determined to put him to death. On hearing this, Uriah took fright and, fleeing, escaped to Egypt.

Jer 26:22 King Jehoiakim, however, sent Elnathan son of Achbor to Egypt with others,

Jer 26:23 who brought Uriah back from Egypt and took him to King Jehoiakim, who had him put to the sword
and his body thrown into the common burial ground.

Jer 26:24 But Jeremiah had a protector in Ahikam son of Shaphan, so he was not handed over to the people to
be put to death.

Jer 27:1 (At the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah
from Yahweh:)

Jer 27:2 Yahweh said this to me, “Make yourself thongs and yokes and put them on your neck.

Jer 27:3 Then send them to the king of Edom, the king of Moab, the king of the Ammonites, the king of Tyre,
and the king of Sidon, through their envoys accredited to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem.

Jer 27:4 Give them the following message for their masters, ‘Yahweh Sabaoth, God of Israel, says this: You
must tell your masters this:

Jer 27:5 I by my great power and outstretched arm made the earth, the human beings and the animals that are
on earth, and I give them to whom I please.

Jer 27:6 For the present, I have handed all these countries over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, my
servant; I have even put the wild animals at his service.

Jer 27:7 (All the nations will serve him, his son and his grandson, until the time for his own country comes in its
turn, when mighty nations and great kings will enslave him.)

Jer 27:8 Any nation or kingdom that will not serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and will not bow its neck to
the yoke of the king of Babylon, I shall punish that nation with sword, famine and plague, Yahweh declares, until
I have destroyed it by his hand.

Jer 27:9 For your own part, do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, dreamers, magicians and sorcerers,
who tell you: You will not be enslaved by the king of Babylon.

Jer 27:10 They prophesy lies to you, the result of which will be that you will be banished from your soil, that I
shall drive you out, and you will perish.

Jer 27:1 1 The nation, however, that is prepared to bend its neck to the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve



him, I shall leave in peace on its own soil, Yahweh declares, to farm it and stay on it’”.

Jer 27:12 To Zedekiah king of Judah I spoke in exactly the same terms. “Bend your necks”, I told him, “to the
yoke of the king of Babylon; serve him and his people and you will survive.

Jer 27:13 (Why so anxious to die, you and your people, by sword, famine and plague, with which Yahweh has
threatened the nation refusing to serve the king of Babylon?)

Jer 27:14 Do not listen to the words the prophets say to you, ‘You will not be enslaved by the king of Babylon’.
They prophesy lies to you.

Jer 27:15 Since I have not sent them, Yahweh declares, they prophesy untruths to you in my name. The result
will be that I shall drive you out, you will perish, and so will the prophets who prophesy to you”.

Jer 27:16 I also spoke to the priests and to all this people as follows, “Yahweh says this, ‘Do not listen to the
words of your prophets who prophesy to you as follows: Look, the vessels of the Temple of Yahweh will very
shortly be brought back from Babylon. They prophesy lies to you.

Jer 27:17 (Do not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon and you will survive. Why should this city become a
ruin?)

Jer 27:18 If they are real prophets, if Yahweh’s word is really with them, they ought now to be pleading with
Yahweh Sabaoth that the remaining vessels in the Temple of Yahweh, in the palace of the king of Judah and
elsewhere in Jerusalem, do not go to Babylon too!

Jer 27:19 For this is what Yahweh Sabaoth says about (the pillars, the Sea, the stands and) the other vessels
still remaining in this city,

Jer 27:20 those not carried off by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon when he took Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim,
king of Judah, into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon (with all the leading men of Judah and Jerusalem).

Jer 27:21 Yes, this is what Yahweh Sabaoth, God of Israel, says about the vessels still remaining in the Temple
of Yahweh, in the palace of the king of Judah and elsewhere in Jerusalem:

Jer 27:22 They will be carried off to Babylon (and stay there until the day I punish them), Yahweh declares.
(Then I shall bring them back and restore them to this place.)’”

Jer 28:1 That same year, at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fifth month of the fourth
year, the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur, a Gibeonite, spoke as follows to Jeremiah in the Temple of Yahweh in
the presence of the priests and of all the people,

Jer 28:2 “Yahweh Sabaoth, the God of Israel, says this, ‘I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.

Jer 28:3 In exactly two years’ time I shall bring back all the vessels of the Temple of Yahweh which
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from here and carried off to Babylon.

Jer 28:4 And I shall also bring back Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah and all the exiles of Judah who
have gone to Babylon, Yahweh declares, for I shall break the yoke of the king of Babylon’”.

Jer 28:5 The prophet Jeremiah then replied to the prophet Hananiah in front of the priests and all the people
present in the Temple of Yahweh.

Jer 28:6 “So be it!”. the prophet Jeremiah said, “May Yahweh do so! May he fulfil the words that you have
prophesied and bring all the vessels of the Temple of Yahweh and all the exiles back to this place from Babylon.
Jer 28:7 Listen carefully, however, to this word that I am now going to say for you and all the people to hear:

Jer 28:8 From remote times, the prophets who preceded you and me prophesied war, disaster and plague for
many countries and for great kingdoms;

Jer 28:9 the prophet who prophesies peace can be recognised as one truly sent by Yahweh only when his word
comes true”.

Jer 28:10 The prophet Hananiah then snatched the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah and broke it.

Jer 28:1 1 In front of all the people Hananiah then said, “Yahweh says this, ‘This is how, in exactly two years’
time, I shall break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and take it off the necks of all the nations’”. At
this, the prophet Jeremiah went away.

Jer 28:12 After the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke he had snatched off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck,
the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah,

Jer 28:13 “Go to Hananiah and tell him this, ‘Yahweh says this: You have broken the wooden yokes only to
make iron yokes to replace them!

Jer 28:14 For Yahweh Sabaoth, the God of Israel, says this: An iron yoke is what I now lay on the necks of all
these nations to enslave them to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. (They will be enslaved to him; I have even
given him the wild animals.)’”

Jer 28:15 The prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah, “Listen carefully, Hananiah: Yahweh has not sent
you; and thanks to you this people is now relying on what is false.

Jer 28:16 And so, Yahweh says this, ‘I am going to send you off the face of the earth: you will die this year
(since you have preached rebellion against Yahweh)’”.

Jer 28:17 The prophet Hananiah died the same year, in the seventh month.

Jer 29:1 This is the text of the letter that the prophet Jeremiah sent from Jerusalem to those who were left of the



elders in exile, to the priests, the prophets and all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had deported from
Jerusalem to Babylon.

Jer 29:2 This was after King Jeconiah had left Jerusalem with the queen mother, the eunuchs, the chief men of
Judah and Jerusalem, and the blacksmiths and metalworkers.

Jer 29:3 The letter was entrusted to Elasah son of Shaphan and to Gemariah son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah
king of Judah had sent to Babylon, to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. The letter said:

Jer 29:4 “Yahweh Sabaoth, the God of Israel, says this to all the exiles deported from Jerusalem to Babylon:

Jer 29:5 Build houses, settle down; plant gardens and eat what they produce;

Jer 29:6 marry and have sons and daughters; choose wives for your sons, find husbands for your daughters so
that these can bear sons and daughters in their turn; you must increase there and not decrease.

Jer 29:7 Work for the good of the city to which I have exiled you; pray to Yahweh on its behalf, since on its
welfare yours depends.

Jer 29:8 For Yahweh Sabaoth, the God of Israel, says this: Do not be deceived by the prophets who are with
you or by your diviners; do not listen to the dreams you have,

Jer 29:9 since they prophesy lies to you in my name. I have not sent them, Yahweh declares.

Jer 29:10 For Yahweh says this: When the seventy years granted to Babylon are over, I shall intervene on your
behalf and fulfil my favourable promise to you by bringing you back to this place.

Jer 29:1 1 Yes, I know what plans I have in mind for you, Yahweh declares, plans for peace, not for disaster, to
give you a future and a hope.

Jer 29:12 When you call to me and come and pray to me, I shall listen to you.

Jer 29:13 When you search for me, you will find me; when you search wholeheartedly for me,

Jer 29:14 I shall let you find me (Yahweh declares. I shall restore your fortunes and gather you in from all the
nations and wherever I have driven you, Yahweh declares. I shall bring you back to the place from which I exiled
you).

Jer 29:15 “Since you say: Yahweh has raised up prophets for us in Babylon-

Jer 29:16 this is what Yahweh says about the king now occupying the throne of David and all the people living in
this city, your brothers who did not go with you into exile:

Jer 29:17 Yahweh Sabaoth says this: I am now going to send them sword, famine and plague; I shall make
them like rotten figs, so bad as to be uneatable.

Jer 29:18 I shall pursue them with sword, famine and plague. I shall make them an object of terror to all the
kingdoms of the earth, a curse, a thing of horror, scorn and derision to all the nations where I have driven them,
Jer 29:19 because they have refused to listen to my words, Yahweh declares, although I have persistently sent
them all my servants the prophets; but they would not listen, Yahweh declares.

Jer 29:20 But all you exiles, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon, listen to Yahweh’s word!

Jer 29:21 “This is what Yahweh Sabaoth, God of Israel, says about Ahab son of Kolaiah, and Zedekiah son of
Maaseiah, who prophesy lies to you in my name: I shall hand them over now to Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon who will put them to death before your very eyes.

Jer 29:22 This curse, based on their fate, will be used by all the exiles of Judah in Babylon: May Yahweh treat
you like Zedekiah and Ahab, roasted alive by the king of Babylon,

Jer 29:23 because they have done a scandalous thing in Israel, committing adultery with their neighbour’s wives
and speaking lying words in my name without orders from me. I know all the same and am witness to it, Yahweh
declares”.

Jer 29:24 “And to Shemaiah of Nehelam you will speak as follows:

Jer 29:25 Yahweh Sabaoth, God of Israel, says this: Since you, on your own initiative, have sent a letter to all
the people in Jerusalem, to the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah (and to all the priests), saying:

Jer 29:26 Yahweh has appointed you priest in place of the priest Jehoiada to keep order in the Temple of
Yahweh, to put any crazy fellow posing as a prophet in the stocks and collar,

Jer 29:27 why then have you not disciplined Jeremiah of Anathoth, now posing as a prophet to you?

Jer 29:28 Why, he has even sent us a message in Babylon, saying: It will be a long time. Build houses, settle
down; plant gardens and eat what they produce.'…

Jer 29:29 (Now, after the priest Zephaniah had read this letter to the prophet Jeremiah),

Jer 29:30 the word of Yahweh came then to Jeremiah as follows,

Jer 29:31 “Send this message to all the exiles, ‘This is what Yahweh says about Shemaiah of Nehelam: Since
Shemaiah has prophesied to you without my sending him, and since he has caused you to rely on what is false
Jer 29:32 for that reason, Yahweh declares, I shall punish Shemaiah of Nehelam and his descendants; no male
member of his family will survive among this people to see the happiness that I will bestow on my people
(Yahweh declares, since he has preached rebellion against Yahweh)’”.

Jer 30:1 The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, as follows,

Jer 30:2 “Yahweh, God of Israel, says this, ‘Write for yourself in a book all the words I have spoken to you.



Jer 30:3 For look, the days are coming, Yahweh declares, when I shall bring back the captives of my people
Israel (and Judah), Yahweh says. I shall make them come back and take possession of the country I gave to
their ancestors’”.

Jer 30:4 These are the words Yahweh spoke about Israel (and Judah):

Jer 30:5 Yahweh says this: We have heard a cry of panic, of terror, not of peace.

Jer 30:6 Now ask and see: can a man bear children? Then why do I see each man with his hands on his loins
like a woman in labour? Why has every face grown pale?

Jer 30:7 Disaster! This is the great day, no other like it: a time of distress for Jacob, though he will be saved
from it.

Jer 30:8 (That day, Yahweh Sabaoth declares, I shall break the yoke now on your neck and snap your chains;
and foreigners will enslave you no more,

Jer 30:9 but Israel and Judah will serve Yahweh their God, and David their king whom I shall raise up for them.)
Jer 30:10 So do not be afraid, my servant Jacob, Yahweh declares, Israel, do not be alarmed: for look, I shall
rescue you from distant countries and your descendants from the country where they are captive. Jacob will
return and be at peace, secure, with no one to trouble him.

Jer 30:1 1 For I am with you to save you, Yahweh declares, I shall make an end of all the nations where I have
driven you, but I shall not make an end of you, only discipline you in moderation, not to let you go quite
unpunished.

Jer 30:12 Yes, Yahweh says this: Your wound is incurable, your injury past healing.

Jer 30:13 There is no one to plead your cause; for an ulcer there are remedies, but for you no cure at all.

Jer 30:14 All your lovers have forgotten you, they look for you no more. Yes, I have struck you as an enemy
strikes, with cruel punishment (because of your great guilt and countless sins).

Jer 30:15 Why cry out because of your wound? Your pain is incurable! Because of your great guilt and
countless sins, I have treated you like this.

Jer 30:16 But all those who devoured you will be devoured, all your enemies, all, go into captivity, those who
despoiled you will be despoiled, and all who pillaged you be pillaged.

Jer 30:17 For I shall restore you to health and heal your wounds, Yahweh declares, you who used to be called
“Outcast”, “Zion for whom no one cares'.

Jer 30:18 Yahweh says this: Look, I shall restore the tents of Jacob and take pity on his dwellings: the town will
be rebuilt on its mound, the stronghold where it ought to stand.

Jer 30:19 From them will come thanksgiving and shouts of joy. I shall make them increase, they will not
decrease; I shall make them honoured, no more to be humbled.

Jer 30:20 Their sons will be as once they were, their community fixed firmly before me, and I shall punish all
their oppressors.

Jer 30:21 Their prince will be one of their own, their ruler come from their own people, and I shall permit him to
approach me freely; for who, otherwise, would be so bold as to approach me, Yahweh demands?

Jer 30:22 You will be my people and I shall be your God.

Jer 30:23 Look, Yahweh’s hurricane, his wrath, bursts out, a roaring hurricane, to burst on the heads of the
wicked;

Jer 30:24 Yahweh’s burning anger will not turn aside until he has performed, has carried out, what he has in
mind. In the final days, you will understand this.

Jer 31:1 When that time comes, Yahweh declares, I shall be the God of all the families of Israel, and they will be
my people.

Jer 31 :2 Yahweh says this: They have found pardon in the desert, those who have survived the sword. Israel is
marching to his rest.

Jer 31 :3 Yahweh has appeared to me from afar; I have loved you with an everlasting love and so I still maintain
my faithful love for you.

Jer 31 :4 I shall build you once more, yes, you will be rebuilt, Virgin of Israel! Once more in your best attire, and
with your tambourines, you will go out dancing gaily.

Jer 31 :5 Once more you will plant vineyards on the mountains of Samaria (those who plant will themselves
enjoy the fruit).

Jer 31 :6 Yes, a day will come when the watchmen shout on the mountains of Ephraim, “Up! Let us go up to
Zion, to Yahweh our God!”.

Jer 31 :7 For Yahweh says this: Shout with joy for Jacob! Hail the chief of nations! Proclaim! Praise! Shout,
“Yahweh has saved his people, the remnant of Israel!”.

Jer 31 :8 Watch, I shall bring them back from the land of the north and gather them in from the far ends of the
earth. With them, the blind and the lame, women with child, women in labour, all together: a mighty throng will
return here!

Jer 31:9 In tears they will return, in prayer I shall lead them. I shall guide them to streams of water, by a smooth



path where they will not stumble. For I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my first-born son.

Jer 31:10 Listen, nations, to the word of Yahweh. On the farthest coasts and islands proclaim it, say, “He who
scattered Israel is gathering him, will guard him as a shepherd guarding his flock”.

Jer 31:11 For Yahweh has ransomed Jacob, rescued him from a hand stronger than his own.

Jer 31:12 They will come, shouting for joy on the heights of Zion, thronging towards Yahweh’s lavish gifts, for
wheat, new wine and oil, sheep and cattle; they will be like a well-watered garden, they will sorrow no more.

Jer 31:13 The young girl will then take pleasure in the dance, and young men and old alike; I shall change their
mourning into gladness, comfort them, give them joy after their troubles;

Jer 31:14 I shall refresh my priests with rich food, and my people will gorge themselves on my lavish gifts,
Yahweh declares.

Jer 31:15 Yahweh says this: A voice is heard in Ramah, lamenting and weeping bitterly: it is Rachel weeping for
her children, refusing to be comforted for her children, because they are no more.

Jer 31:16 Yahweh says this: Stop your lamenting dry your eyes, for your labour will have a reward, Yahweh
declares, and they will return from the enemy’s country.

Jer 31:17 There is hope for your future after all, Yahweh declares, your children will return to their homeland.

Jer 31:18 I have indeed heard Ephraim’s grieving, “You flogged me, I took a flogging, like a young, untrained
bull. Bring me back, let me come back, for you are Yahweh my God!

Jer 31:19 For, since I turned away, I have repented; having understood, I beat my breast. I was deeply
ashamed, I blushed, aware of the disgrace incurred when I was young”.

Jer 31 :20 Is Ephraim, then, so dear a son to me, a child so favoured, that whenever I mention him I remember
him lovingly still? That is why I yearn for him, why I must take pity on him, Yahweh declares.

Jer 31 :21 Set up your signposts, raise yourself landmarks, fix your mind on the road, the way by which you
went. Come home, Virgin of Israel, come home to these towns of yours.

Jer 31 :22 How long will you hesitate, rebellious daughter? For Yahweh is creating something new on earth: the
Woman sets out to find her Husband again.

Jer 31 :23 Yahweh Sabaoth, the God of Israel, says this, “In the country of Judah and in its towns, they will use
these words once more, when I bring their captives home: ‘Yahweh bless you, home of saving justice, holy
mountain!’.

Jer 31 :24 “And in this country, Judah and all its towns, the ploughmen and those who wander with their flocks,
will live together,

Jer 31 :25 for I shall give the weary all they need and satisfy all those whose strength has gone”.

Jer 31 :26 At this, I awoke and saw that my sleep had been sweet to me.

Jer 31:27 “Look, the days are coming, Yahweh declares, when I shall sow the House of Israel and the House of
Judah with the seed both of people and of cattle.

Jer 31:28 And as I once watched over them to uproot, to knock down, to overthrow, destroy and bring disaster,
so now I shall watch over them to build and to plant, Yahweh declares.

Jer 31:29 “In those days people will no longer say: ‘The fathers have eaten unripe grapes; the children’s teeth
are set on edge’.

Jer 31 :30 But each will die for his own guilt. Everyone who eats unripe grapes will have his own teeth set on
edge.

Jer 31 :31 “Look, the days are coming, Yahweh declares, when I shall make a new covenant with the House of
Israel (and the House of Judah),

Jer 31 :32 but not like the covenant I made with their ancestors the day I took them by the hand to bring them out
of Egypt, a covenant which they broke, even though I was their Master, Yahweh declares.

Jer 31 :33 No, this is the covenant I shall make with the House of Israel when those days have come, Yahweh
declares. Within them I shall plant my Law, writing it on their hearts. Then I shall be their God and they will be my
people.

Jer 31 :34 There will be no further need for everyone to teach neighbour or brother, saying, ‘Learn to know
Yahweh!’. No, they will all know me, from the least to the greatest, Yahweh declares, since I shall forgive their
guilt and never more call their sin to mind”.

Jer 31 :35 Yahweh who provides the sun to shine by day, who regulates moon and stars to shine by night, who
stirs the sea, making its waves roar, he whose name is Yahweh Sabaoth, says this,

Jer 31 :36 “Were this established order ever to pass away before me, Yahweh declares, then the race of Israel
would also cease being a nation for ever before me!”.

Jer 31 :37 Yahweh says this, “Were the heavens above ever to be measured, the foundations of the earth below
ever to be fathomed, then I too would reject the whole race of Israel for all that they have done, Yahweh
declares”.

Jer 31 :38 “Look, the days are coming, Yahweh declares, when the City will be rebuilt for Yahweh, from the
Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate.



Jer 31 :39 Then once again the measuring line will stretch straight to the Hill of Gareb, turning then to Goah.

Jer 31 :40 And the whole valley, with its corpses and ashes, and all the ground beside the ravine of the Kidron
as far as the corner of the Horse Gate, eastwards, will be consecrated to Yahweh. It will never be destroyed or
demolished again.

Jer 32:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was
the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar.

Jer 32:2 The army of the king of Babylon was then besieging Jerusalem, and the prophet Jeremiah was
confined in the Court of the Guard in the king of Judah’s palace,

Jer 32:3 where Zedekiah king of Judah had confined him, saying, “Why do you keep prophesying like this,
‘Yahweh says this: I am going to hand this city over to the king of Babylon and he will capture it;

Jer 32:4 and Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape the clutches of the Chaldaeans, but will certainly be
handed over to the king of Babylon, speak to him personally and see him face to face.

Jer 32:5 He will take Zedekiah away to Babylon and there he will stay (until I attend to him, Yahweh declares. If
you fight the Chaldaeans you will not succeed!)’”

Jer 32:6 Jeremiah said, “The word of Yahweh has been addressed to me as follows,

Jer 32:7 ‘Look, Hanamel the son of your uncle Shallum will come to you and say: Buy my field at Anathoth, for
you have the right of redemption to purchase it’.

Jer 32:8 And, as Yahweh had said, my cousin Hanamel came to me, in the Court of the Guard and said, ‘Buy
my field at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin, for you have the right of inheritance and right of redemption; buy
it’. I knew then that this was Yahweh’s order.

Jer 32:9 Accordingly, I bought the field from my cousin Hanamel of Anathoth and weighed him out the money:
seventeen silver shekels.

Jer 32:10 I drew up the deeds and sealed it, called in witnesses and weighed out the money on the scales.

Jer 32:1 1 I then took both the sealed deed of purchase (with its stipulations and clauses) and its open copy
Jer 32:12 and handed over the deed of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah, son of Mahseiah, in the presence of
my cousin Hanamel, of the witnesses who had signed the deed of purchase, and of all the Judaeans who then
happened to be in the Court of the Guard.

Jer 32:13 In their presence I gave Baruch this order,

Jer 32:14 ‘Yahweh Sabaoth, God of Israel, says this: Take these deeds, the sealed deed of purchase and its
open copy, and put them in an earthenware pot, so that they may be preserved for a long time.

Jer 32:15 For Yahweh Sabaoth, God of Israel, says this: Houses, fields and vineyards will again be bought in
this country’.

Jer 32:16 “After I had entrusted the deed of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah, I prayed to Yahweh as follows,
Jer 32:17 ‘Ah, Lord Yahweh, you made the heavens and the earth by your great power and outstretched arm.

To you nothing is impossible.

Jer 32:18 You show faithful love to thousands but repay the fathers’ guilt in full to their children after them. Great
and mighty God, whose name is Yahweh Sabaoth,

Jer 32:19 great in purpose, mighty in deed, whose eyes are open on all human ways, rewarding every individual
as that person’s ways and actions deserve!

Jer 32:20 You performed signs and wonders in Egypt, as you still do in Israel and among humanity today. You
have won the name for yourself which is yours today.

Jer 32:21 You brought your people Israel out of Egypt with signs and wonders, with mighty hand and
outstretched arm and fearsome terror.

Jer 32:22 Then you gave them this country which you had promised on oath to their ancestors, a country
flowing with milk and honey.

Jer 32:23 They then entered it, taking possession of it, but they would not listen to your voice nor follow your
Law: they would do nothing you ordered them to do; and so you made this total disaster befall them.

Jer 32:24 Look! The earthworks are already in place to take the city and, by means of sword, famine and
plague, the city is now within the clutches of the Chaldaeans attacking it. What you said has now come true, as
you see.

Jer 32:25 Yet you yourself, Lord Yahweh, told me: Buy the field, pay for it, have it witnessed although the city is
already in the Chaldaeans’ clutches’”.

Jer 32:26 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Jer 32:27 “Look, I am Yahweh, God of all humanity. Is anything impossible to me?

Jer 32:28 “So, Yahweh says this, ‘I shall hand this city over to the Chaldaeans and to Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon, and he will capture it;

Jer 32:29 the Chaldaeans attacking this city will enter it, fire it and burn it to the ground, with the houses on
whose roofs incense has been offered to Baal and libations poured to other gods, to provoke my anger.

Jer 32:30 For the people of Israel and Judah alike have done nothing but what displeases me since they were



young. (The people of Israel in fact have done nothing but provoke my anger by their actions, Yahweh declares.)
Jer 32:31 Yes, from the day when this city was built until today, it has been such cause of anger and wrath to
me that I mean to remove it from my sight,

Jer 32:32 on account of all the wickedness the people of Israel and the people of Judah have done to provoke
my anger; they, their kings, their chief men, their priests, their prophets, the people of Judah and the inhabitants
of Jerusalem.

Jer 32:33 They turned to me their backs, never their faces; and though I taught them so urgently, so untiringly,
they would not listen and accept correction.

Jer 32:34 Instead, they set up their Horrors in the Temple that bears my name to defile it,

Jer 32:35 and built the high places of Baal in the Valley of Ben-Hinnom, to burn their sons and daughters alive
in honour of Molech: a thing I have never ordered, that had never entered my thoughts — that they would cause
Judah to sin by anything so loathsome!

Jer 32:36 ‘So now, this is what Yahweh, God of Israel, says about this city of which you now say: By means of
sword, famine and plague, it is already within the king of Babylon’s clutches:

Jer 32:37 Look, I shall gather them in from all the countries where I have driven them in my anger, my fury and
great wrath. I shall bring them back to this place and make them live in safety.

Jer 32:38 Then they will be my people, and I shall be their God.

Jer 32:39 I shall give them singleness of heart and singleness of conduct so that they will always fear me, for
their own good and that of their children after them.

Jer 32:40 I shall make an everlasting covenant with them, never to cease in my efforts for their welfare, and I
shall put respect for me in their hearts, so that they will never turn away from me again.

Jer 32:41 My joy will lie in them and in doing them good, and I shall plant them firmly in this country, with all my
heart and soul.

Jer 32:42 For Yahweh says this: Just as I have brought this complete and total disaster on this people, so I shall
bring them all the good things I have promised them.

Jer 32:43 Fields will again be bought in this country of which you now say: It is a wasteland without human or
animal, already in the clutches of the Chaldaeans.

Jer 32:44 People will buy fields, pay money, draw up deeds, seal them and have them witnessed in the territory
of Benjamin, in the districts round Jerusalem, in the towns of Judah, of the highlands, of the lowlands and of the
Negeb. For I shall bring back their captives, Yahweh declares’”.

Jer 33:1 Jeremiah was still confined to the Court of the Guard when the word of Yahweh came to him a second
time, as follows,

Jer 33:2 “Yahweh who made the earth, who formed it and set it firm — Yahweh is his name — says this,

Jer 33:3 ‘Call to me and I will answer you; I will tell you great secrets of which you know nothing.

Jer 33:4 For this is what Yahweh, God of Israel, says about the houses of this city and the palaces of the kings
of Judah which are about to be destroyed by means of the earthworks and the sword;

Jer 33:5 about those now fighting the Chaldaeans, only to fill the city with corpses, those whom I have
slaughtered in my furious anger, those whose wickedness has made me hide my face from this city:

Jer 33:6 Look, I shall bring them remedy and cure; I shall cure them and reveal a new order of peace and loyalty
to them.

Jer 33:7 I shall bring back the captives of Judah and the captives of Israel and shall rebuild them as before.

Jer 33:8 I shall cleanse them of all their guilt, by which they have offended me, I shall forgive all their guilty
actions, by which they have offended me and rebelled against me.

Jer 33:9 And, for me, Jerusalem will become a name of joy and praise and pride for all the nations on earth to
see; when they hear of all the prosperity that I shall give, they will be seized with fear and trembling at all the
prosperity and the peace that I provide for it’.

Jer 33:10 “Yahweh says this, ‘In this place of which you now say: It is a ruin, without human or animal, in the
towns of Judah and desolate streets of Jerusalem where there is neither human nor animal, once more will be
heard

Jer 33:1 1 shouts of rejoicing and mirth, the voices of bridegroom and bride, and the singing of those who bring
thanksgiving sacrifices to the Temple of Yahweh: Give thanks to Yahweh Sabaoth, for Yahweh is good, for his
faithful love is everlasting. For I shall bring back the country’s captives, as before, Yahweh says’.

Jer 33:12 “Yahweh Sabaoth says this, ‘In this ruinous place, without human or animal, in all its towns, once
again there will be pastures for the shepherds to rest their flocks.

Jer 33:13 In the towns of the highlands, of the lowlands and the Negeb, in the territory of Benjamin, in the
districts round Jerusalem and in the towns of Judah, once again the flocks shall pass under the hand of
someöne who counts them, Yahweh says.

Jer 33:14 ‘Look, the days are coming, Yahweh declares, when I shall fulfil the promise of happiness I made to
the House of Israel and the House of Judah:



Jer 33:15 In those days and at that time, I shall make an upright Branch grow for David, who will do what is just
and upright in the country.

Jer 33:16 In those days Judah will triumph and Israel live in safety. And this is the name the city will be called:
Yahweh-is-our-Saving-Justice’.

Jer 33:17 “For Yahweh says this, ‘David will never lack a male descendant to occupy the throne of the House of
Israel,

Jer 33:18 nor will the levitical priests ever lack male descendants to stand before me and offer the burnt
offering, to burn the cereal offering and offer sacrifice every day’”.

Jer 33:19 The word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah as follows,

Jer 33:20 “Yahweh says this, ‘If you could break my covenant with the day and my covenant with the night so
that day and night do not come at their due time,

Jer 33:21 then my covenant with David my servant might also be broken and he would have no son to reign on
his throne, and so also might my covenant with the levitical priests, who are my ministers.

Jer 33:22 As surely as the array of heaven cannot be counted, nor the sand of the sea be measured, so surely
shall I increase the heirs of David my servant and the Levites who minister to me’”.

Jer 33:23 The word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah as follows,

Jer 33:24 “Have you not noticed what these people say, ‘The two families which Yahweh chose he has now
rejected?’ So they despise my people, whom they no longer think of as a nation.

Jer 33:25 Yahweh says this, ‘If I have not created day and night and fixed the laws governing heaven and earth,
Jer 33:26 why, then I shall reject the descendants of Jacob and of David my servant and cease to choose rulers
from his descendants for the heirs of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob! For I shall bring back their captives and take
pity on them’”.

Jer 34:1 The word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and his whole army,
with all the kingdoms of the earth under his dominion and all the peoples, were waging war on Jerusalem and all
its towns,

Jer 34:2 “Yahweh, God of Israel, says this, ‘Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah and tell him, Yahweh says
this: I am going to hand this city over to the power of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it down.

Jer 34:3 And you yourself will not escape his clutches but will certainly be captured and handed over to him.

You will see the king of Babylon face to face and speak to him personally. Then you will go to Babylon.

Jer 34:4 Even so, listen to the word of Yahweh, Zedekiah king of Judah! This is what Yahweh says about you:
You will not die by the sword;

Jer 34:5 you will die in peace. And as spices were burnt for your ancestors, the kings who in times past
preceded you, so spices will be burnt for you and a dirge sung for you: Alas for his highness! I have spoken,
Yahweh declares’”.

Jer 34:6 The prophet Jeremiah repeated all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,

Jer 34:7 while the army of the king of Babylon was attacking Jerusalem and all such towns of Judah as still held
out, namely Lachish and Azekah, these being the only fortified towns of Judah remaining.

Jer 34:8 The word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people
in Jerusalem to issue a proclamation freeing their slaves:

Jer 34:9 each man was to free his Hebrew slaves, men and women, no one was any longer to keep a brother
Judaean in slavery.

Jer 34:10 All the chief men and all the people who had entered into the covenant had agreed that everyone
should free his slaves, men or women, and no longer keep them as slaves: they had agreed on this and set
them free.

Jer 34:1 1 Afterwards, however, they changed their minds, recovered the slaves, men and women, whom they
had set free, and reduced them to slavery again.

Jer 34:12 The word of Yahweh came then to Jeremiah as follows,

Jer 34:13 “Yahweh, God of Israel, says this, ‘I made a covenant with your ancestors when I brought them out of
Egypt, out of the house of slavery; it said:

Jer 34:14 At the end of seven years each one of you is to free his brother Hebrew who has sold himself to you:
he may be your slave for six years, then you must send him away free. But your ancestors did not listen to me
and would not pay attention.

Jer 34:15 Now, today you repented and did what pleases me by proclaiming freedom for your neighbour; you
made a covenant before me in the Temple that bears my name.

Jer 34:16 And then you changed your minds and, profaning my name, each of you has recovered his slaves,
men and women, whom you had sent away free to live their own lives, and has forced them to become your
slaves again’.

Jer 34:17 “So Yahweh says this: ‘You have disobeyed me, by failing to grant freedom to brother and neighbour.
Very well, I in my turn, Yahweh declares, shall leave sword, famine and plague free to deal with you and I shall



make you an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.

Jer 34:18 As for the people who have broken my covenant, who have not observed the terms of the covenant
which they made before me, I shall treat them like the calf that people cut in two to pass between its pieces.

Jer 34:19 The chief men of Judah and Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests, and all the country people who have
passed between the pieces of the calf,

Jer 34:20 I shall hand over to their enemies and those determined to kill them, and their corpses will be food for
the birds of the sky and the animals of earth.

Jer 34:21 As for Zedekiah king of Judah and his chief men, I shall hand them to their enemies, to those
determined to kill them, and to the army of the king of Babylon which has just withdrawn.

Jer 34:22 Listen, I shall give the order, Yahweh declares, and bring them back to this city to attack it and
capture it and burn it down. And I shall make an uninhabited waste of the towns of Judah’”.

Jer 35:1 The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah,
Jer 35:2 “Go to the clan of the Rechabites and speak to them; bring them into one of the rooms of the Temple of
Yahweh and offer them wine to drink”.

Jer 35:3 So I took Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah, with his brothers and all his sons, the whole
Rechabite clan,

Jer 35:4 and brought them to the Temple of Yahweh into the room of Ben-Johanan son of Igdaliah, a man of
God, which was next to that of the chief men, above the room of Maaseiah son of Shallum, guardian of the
threshold.

Jer 35:5 I then set pitchers full of wine, and some cups, before the members of the Rechabite clan and said,
“Drink some wine”.

Jer 35:6 But they replied, “We do not drink wine, because our ancestor Jonadab son of Rechab gave us this
order, ‘You must not drink wine, neither you nor your sons for ever;

Jer 35:7 nor must you build houses, sow seed, plant vineyards or own them, but must live in tents all your lives,
so that you may live long on the soil to which you are alien’.

Jer 35:8 We have punctiliously obeyed the orders of our ancestor, Jonadab son of Rechab, never drinking wine
ourselves, nor our wives, our sons or our daughters,

Jer 35:9 not building houses to live in, owning neither vineyard nor field nor seed,

Jer 35:10 living in tents. We have obeyed the orders of our ancestor Jonadab, respecting them in every
particular.

Jer 35:1 1 However, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon invaded this country, we decided, ‘We must get
away! We will go to Jerusalem to escape the armies of the Chaldaeans and Aramaeans’. So that is why we are
living in Jerusalem”.

Jer 35:12 Then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah as follows,

Jer 35:13 “Yahweh Sabaoth, the God of Israel, says this, ‘Go and say to the people of Judah and the inhabitants
of Jerusalem: Will you never learn the lesson and listen to my words, Yahweh demands?

Jer 35:14 The words of Jonadab son of Rechab, ordering his sons to drink no wine, have been observed;
obedient to their ancestor’s command, they drink none even today . But to me, who spoke to you so urgently, so
untiringly, you have not listened.

Jer 35:15 I have urgently and untiringly sent you all my servants the prophets to say: Turn back, each one of
you, from your evil behaviour and amend your actions, do not follow other gods to serve them, and you will go on
living on the soil I gave to you and your ancestors. But you have not paid attention or listened to me.

Jer 35:16 Thus the sons of Jonadab son of Rechab have kept the command their ancestor gave them, but this
people has not listened to me.

Jer 35:17 And so, Yahweh, God Sabaoth, God of Israel, says this: Look, on Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem
I am going to bring all the disaster which I have decreed for them, because I spoke to them and they would not
listen, called to them and they would not answer’”.

Jer 35:18 Then Jeremiah said to the Rechabite clan, “Yahweh Sabaoth, the God of Israel, says this, ‘Because
you have obeyed the orders of your ancestor Jonadab and observed all his rules and done everything he
ordered you to do,

Jer 35:19 therefore, Yahweh Sabaoth, the God of Israel, says this: Jonadab son of Rechab will never lack a
male descendant to stand before me for ever’”.

Jer 36:1 In the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh,
Jer 36:2 “Take a scroll and on it write all the words I have spoken to you about Israel, Judah and all the nations,
from the day I first spoke to you, in the time of Josiah, until today.

Jer 36:3 Perhaps when the House of Judah hears about all the disaster I intend to inflict on them, they will turn,
each one of them, from their evil behaviour, so that I can forgive their sinful guilt”.

Jer 36:4 Jeremiah then summoned Baruch son of Neriah, who at his dictation wrote down on the scroll all the
words Yahweh had spoken to him.



Jer 36:5 Jeremiah then gave Baruch this order, “As I am prevented from entering the Temple of Yahweh,

Jer 36:6 you yourself must go and, from the scroll you wrote at my dictation, read all Yahweh’s words to the
people in his Temple on the day of the fast, and in this way you can read them in the hearing also of all the
Judaeans who come in from their towns.

Jer 36:7 Perhaps their prayers will move Yahweh and they will turn one and all from their evil behaviour, for
great is the furious anger with which Yahweh has threatened this people”.

Jer 36:8 Baruch son of Neriah duly carried out the order that the prophet Jeremiah had given him, to read all
Yahweh’s words from the book in his Temple.

Jer 36:9 Now, in the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people of
Jerusalem and all the people who could get to Jerusalem from the towns of Judah were summoned to a fast
before Yahweh.

Jer 36:10 Baruch then read Jeremiah’s words from the book; this happened in the room of Gemariah son of the
scribe Shaphan, in the upper court at the entry of the New Gate of the Temple of Yahweh, where all the people
could hear.

Jer 36:1 1 Micaiah son of Gemariah, son of Shaphan, having heard all Yahweh’s words read from the book,

Jer 36:12 went down to the royal palace, to the scribe’s room. All the chief men were in session: the scribe
Elishama, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Achbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of
Hananiah and all the other chief men;

Jer 36:13 and to them Micaiah reported all the words he heard as Baruch was reading the book aloud to the
people.

Jer 36:14 The chief men then by common consent sent Jehudi son of Netaniah to Baruch, with Shelemiah son
of Cushi, to say, “Come, and bring the scroll with you which you have been reading to the people”.

Jer 36:15 Bringing the scroll with him, Baruch son of Neriah appeared before them. “Sit down”, they said, “and
read it out”. So Baruch read it to them.

Jer 36:16 Having heard all the words they turned to one another in alarm and said to Baruch, “We must certainly
inform the king of this”.

Jer 36:17 They then questioned Baruch, “Tell us”, they said, “how you came to write all these words”.

Jer 36:18 “Jeremiah dictated them all to me”, Baruch replied, “and I wrote them down in ink in this book”.

Jer 36:19 The chief men said to Baruch, “You and Jeremiah had better go into hiding; and do not tell anyone
where you are”.

Jer 36:20 Whereüpon they went off to the king in the palace court, depositing the scroll in the room of the scribe
Elishama. They then informed the king of the whole affair.

Jer 36:21 The king sent Jehudi for the scroll, and he brought it from the room of the scribe Elishama and read it
to the king and all the chief men standing round the king.

Jer 36:22 The king was sitting in his winter apartments — it was the ninth month — with a fire burning in a brazier
in front of him.

Jer 36:23 Each time Jehudi had read three or four columns, the king cut them off with a scribe’s knife and threw
them into the fire in the brazier until the whole of the scroll had been burnt in the brazier fire.

Jer 36:24 But in spite of hearing all these words, neither the king nor any of his courtiers took alarm or tore their
clothes;

Jer 36:25 and although Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had urged the king not to burn the scroll he would
not listen to them,

Jer 36:26 but ordered the king’s son Jerahmeel and Seraiah son of Azriel and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to
arrest the scribe Baruch and the prophet Jeremiah. But Yahweh had hidden them.

Jer 36:27 Then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, after the king had burnt the scroll containing the words
Baruch had written at Jeremiah’s dictation,

Jer 36:28 “Take another scroll and write down all the words that were written on the first scroll burnt by
Jehoiakim king of Judah.

Jer 36:29 And as regards Jehoiakim king of Judah, you are to say, ‘Yahweh says this: You have burnt that
scroll, saying: Why have you written down: The king of Babylon will certainly come and lay this country waste
and leave it without human or animal?

Jer 36:30 So, this is what Yahweh says about Jehoiakim king of Judah: He will have no one to occupy the
throne of David, and his corpse will be tossed out to the heat of the day and the frost of the night.

Jer 36:31 I shall punish him, his offspring and his courtiers for their guilt; on them, on the citizens of Jerusalem
and on the people of Judah I shall bring the total disaster which I had decreed for them but to which they have
paid no attention’.

Jer 36:32 Jeremiah then took another scroll and gave it to the scribe Baruch son of Neriah, who in it at
Jeremiah’s dictation wrote all the words of the book that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burnt, with many similar
words in addition.



Jer 37:1 Zedekiah son of Josiah became king, succeeding Coniah son of Jehoiakim. Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon had made him king of Judah.

Jer 37:2 But neither he nor his courtiers nor the people of the country paid any attention to the words Yahweh
spoke through the prophet Jeremiah.

Jer 37:3 King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to the prophet
Jeremiah with this message, “Intercede for us with Yahweh our God”.

Jer 37:4 Now Jeremiah was still moving freely among the people: he had not yet been put in prison.

Jer 37:5 Meanwhile Pharaoh’s army was on the move from Egypt and the Chaldaeans besieging Jerusalem had
raised the siege when they heard the news.

Jer 37:6 Then the word of Yahweh came to the prophet Jeremiah as follows,

Jer 37:7 “Yahweh, God of Israel, says this, ‘To the king of Judah who sent you to consult me make this reply: Is
Pharaoh’s army marching to your aid? It will withdraw to its own country, Egypt.

Jer 37:8 The Chaldaeans will return to attack this city; they will capture it and burn it down.

Jer 37:9 Yahweh says this: Do not cheer yourselves up by thinking: The Chaldaeans are leaving us for good.
They are not leaving.

Jer 37:10 Even if you cut to pieces the whole Chaldaean army now fighting against you until there were only the
wounded left, they would stand up again, each man in his tent, to burn this city down’”.

Jer 37:1 1 At the time when the Chaldaean army, threatened by Pharaoh’s army, had raised the siege of
Jerusalem,

Jer 37:12 Jeremiah set out from Jerusalem for the territory of Benjamin to see about a piece of his property
among the people there.

Jer 37:13 He was at the Benjamin Gate when the guard commander there, a certain Irijah son of Shelemiah,
son of Hananiah, arrested the prophet Jeremiah, shouting, “You are deserting to the Chaldaeans!”.

Jer 37:14 Jeremiah answered, “It is a lie! I am not deserting to the Chaldaeans”. But Irijah would not listen to
Jeremiah and took him under arrest to the chief men.

Jer 37:15 And the chief men, furious with Jeremiah, had him beaten and shut up in the house of the scribe
Jonathan, which had been turned into a prison.

Jer 37:16 Thus Jeremiah found himself in an underground vault. And there for a long time he stayed.

Jer 37:17 Later, King Zedekiah had him sent for, and the king questioned him privately in his palace. “Is there
any word from Yahweh?”. he asked. “There is”, Jeremiah answered, and added, “you will be handed over to the
king of Babylon”.

Jer 37:18 Jeremiah then said to King Zedekiah, “What wrong have I done you, or your courtiers or this people,
for you to have put me in prison?

Jer 37:19 Where are your prophets now who prophesied, ‘The king of Babylon will not attack you or this
country?’

Jer 37:20 So now I beg you to hear me, my lord king! I beg you to approve my request! Do not have me taken
back to the house of the scribe Jonathan, or I shall die there”.

Jer 37:21 King Zedekiah then gave an order, and Jeremiah was confined in the Court of the Guard and given a
loaf of bread a day from the Street of the Bakers as long as there was bread left in the city. So Jeremiah stayed
in the Court of the Guard.

Jer 38:1 But Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jucal son of Shelemiah and Pashhur son of
Malchiah heard the words which Jeremiah was saying to all the people,

Jer 38:2 “Yahweh says this, ‘Anyone who stays in this city will die by sword, famine or plague; but anyone who
leaves it and surrenders to the Chaldaeans will live; he will escape with his life.

Jer 38:3 Yahweh says this: This city will certainly be handed over to the army of the king of Babylon, and he will
capture it’”.

Jer 38:4 The chief men then said to the king, “You must have this man put to death: he is unquestionably
disheartening the remaining soldiers in the city, and all the people too, by talking like this. This man is seeking
not the welfare of the people but their ruin”.

Jer 38:5 King Zedekiah answered, “He is in your hands as you know, for the king is powerless to oppose you”.
Jer 38:6 So they took Jeremiah and put him into the storage-well of the king’s son Malchiah in the Court of the
Guard, letting him down with ropes. There was no water in the storage-well, only mud, and into the mud
Jeremiah sank.

Jer 38:7 But Ebed-Melech the Cushite, a eunuch attached to the palace, heard that Jeremiah had been put into
the storage-well. As the king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate,

Jer 38:8 Ebed-Melech came out from the palace and spoke to the king.

Jer 38:9 “My lord king”, he said, “these men have done a wicked thing by treating the prophet Jeremiah like this:
they have thrown him into the storage-well. He will starve to death there, since there is no more food in the city”.
Jer 38:10 At this the king gave Ebed-Melech the Cushite the following order: “Take thirty men with you from here



and pull the prophet Jeremiah out of the storage-well before he dies”.

Jer 38:1 1 Ebed-Melech took the men with him and went into the palace to the Treasury wardrobe; out of it he
took some torn, worn-out rags which he lowered on ropes to Jeremiah in the storage-well.

Jer 38:12 Ebed-Melech the Cushite then said to Jeremiah, These torn, worn-out rags are for you to put under
your armpits to pad the ropes”. Jeremiah did this.

Jer 38:13 Then they hauled Jeremiah up with the ropes and pulled him out of the storage-well. And Jeremiah
stayed in the Court of the Guard.

Jer 38:14 King Zedekiah had the prophet Jeremiah summoned to him at the third entrance to the Temple of
Yahweh. “I want to ask you for a word”, the king said to Jeremiah, “keep nothing back from me”.

Jer 38:15 Jeremiah answered Zedekiah, “If I do proclaim it to you, are you not sure to have me put to death?
And if I give you advice, you will not listen to me”.

Jer 38:16 King Zedekiah then secretly swore this oath to Jeremiah, “As Yahweh lives, giver of this life of ours, I
will have you neither put to death nor handed over to these men who are determined to kill you”.

Jer 38:17 Jeremiah then said to Zedekiah, “Yahweh, God Sabaoth, God of Israel, says this, ‘If you go out and
surrender to the king of Babylon’s generals, your life will be safe and this city will not be burnt down; you and
your family will survive.

Jer 38:18 But if you do not go out and surrender to the king of Babylon’s generals, this city will be handed over
to the Chaldaeans and they will burn it down; nor will you yourself escape their clutches’”.

Jer 38:19 King Zedekiah then said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Judaeans who have already gone over to the
Chaldaeans: I might be handed over to them and they would ill-treat me”.

Jer 38:20 “You will not be handed over to them”, Jeremiah replied. “Please listen to Yahweh’s voice as I have
relayed it to you, and then all will go well with you and your life will be safe.

Jer 38:21 But if you refuse to surrender, this is what Yahweh has shown me:

Jer 38:22 the sight of all the women left in the king of Judah’s palace being led off to the king of Babylon’s
generals and saying: ‘They have misled you, they have triumphed over you, those friends of yours! Your feet
have sunk in the mud! They are up and away!’.

Jer 38:23 “Yes, all your wives and children will be led off to the Chaldaeans, and you yourself will not escape
their clutches but will be a prisoner in the clutches of the king of Babylon. And as for this city, it will be burnt
down”.

Jer 38:24 Zedekiah then said to Jeremiah, “Do not let anyone else hear these words or you will die.

Jer 38:25 If the chief men hear that I have been talking to you, and come and say, ‘Tell us what you said to the
king and what the king said to you; keep nothing back from us, or we shall put you to death’,

Jer 38:26 you must reply, ‘I presented this request to the king: that he would not have me sent back to
Jonathan’s house to die’”.

Jer 38:27 And in fact all the chief men came to Jeremiah and questioned him. He told them exactly what the
king had ordered him to say. They then left him in peace, since the conversation had not been overheard.

Jer 38:28 And Jeremiah stayed in the Court of the Guard until the day Jerusalem was captured. And he was
there when Jerusalem actually was captured.

Jer 39:1 In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
advanced on Jerusalem with his entire army, and they laid siege to it.

Jer 39:2 In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, a breach was made in the city wall.

Jer 39:3 The king of Babylon’s officials, all having made their entry, took their seats in the Middle Gate: Nergal-
Sharezer, Samgar-Nebo, Sar-Sechim a high dignitary of state, Nergal-Sharezer the chief astrologer, and all the
king of Babylon’s other officials …

Jer 39:4 On seeing them, Zedekiah king of Judah and all the fighting men fled, leaving the city under cover of
dark, by way of the king’s garden through the gate between the two walls, and made their way towards the
Arabah.

Jer 39:5 But the Chaldaean troops pursued them and caught up with Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. They
captured him and took him to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon at Riblah in the territory of Hamath, where he
passed sentence on him.

Jer 39:6 The king of Babylon had Zedekiah’s sons slaughtered before his eyes at Riblah; the king of Babylon
also had all the leading men of Judah put to death.

Jer 39:7 He then put out Zedekiah’s eyes and, loading him with chains, carried him off to Babylon.

Jer 39:8 The Chaldaeans burnt down the royal palace and the private houses, and demolished the walls of
Jerusalem.

Jer 39:9 Nebuzaradan commander of the guard deported the remainder of the population left behind in the city,
the deserters who had gone over to him, and the rest of the artisans to Babylon.

Jer 39:10 But Nebuzaradan commander of the guard left some of the poor people behind in the country of
Judah, those who had nothing, at the same time giving them vineyards and fields.



Jer 39:1 1 With regard to Jeremiah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had given the following orders to
Nebuzaradan, commander of the guard,

Jer 39:12 “Take him, look after him; do him no harm, but treat him as he may ask you”.

Jer 39:13 He entrusted this mission to (Nebuzaradan commander of the guard,) Nebushazban the high dignitary
of state, Nergal-Sharezer the chief astrologer and all the king of Babylon’s other officials.

Jer 39:14 These despatched men to take Jeremiah from the Court of the Guard and turned him over to
Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan for safe conduct home. So he remained among the people.

Jer 39:15 While Jeremiah was confined in the Court of the Guard, the word of Yahweh came to him as follows,
Jer 39:16 “Go and say to Ebed-Melech the Cushite, ‘Yahweh, God of Israel says this: Look, I am about to
perform my words about this city for its ruin and not for its prosperity. That day they will come true before your
eyes.

Jer 39:17 But I shall rescue you that day, Yahweh declares, and you will not be handed over to the hands of the
men you fear.

Jer 39:18 Yes, I shall certainly rescue you: you will not fall to the sword; you will escape with your life, because
you have put your trust in me, Yahweh declares’.

Jer 40:1 The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh after Nebuzaradan commander of the guard had
released him from Ramah, where he had found him in chains with all the other captives from Jerusalem and
Judah who were being deported to Babylon:

Jer 40:2 The commander of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him, “Yahweh your God foretold calamity for
this country,

Jer 40:3 and now he has brought it. He has done what he threatened to do, because you had sinned against
Yahweh and would not listen to his voice; so all this has happened to you.

Jer 40:4 Look, today I am having your hands unchained. If you like to come with me to Babylon, come: I shall
look after you. If you do not want to come with me to Babylon, do not. Look, you have the whole country before
you: go wherever you think it best and most suitable to go”.

Jer 40:5 And before Jeremiah retired, he added, “You can go back to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan,
whom the king of Babylon has appointed governor of the towns of Judah, and stay with him among the people,
or go anywhere else you think suitable”. With that, the commander of the guard gave him provisions and a
present, and dismissed him.

Jer 40:6 Jeremiah went to Mizpah, to Gedaliah son of Ahikam and stayed with him, among those people still left
in the country.

Jer 40:7 When the military leaders who with their men were still in the field, all heard that the king of Babylon
had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam as governor of the country, making him responsible for the men, women
and children, and those of the poor country people who had not been deported to Babylon,

Jer 40:8 they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah: Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan sons of Kareah,
Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, Jezaniah son of the Maacathite, they and their
men.

Jer 40:9 To them and to their men Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, swore an oath. “Do not be afraid”,
he said, “of serving the Chaldaeans, stay in the country, serve the king of Babylon, and all will go well with you.
Jer 40:10 I for my part, as the man answerable to the Chaldaeans when they come to us, shall stay here at
Mizpah, whereäs you can harvest the wine, summer fruit and oil, fill your storage jars and settle in the towns
which you have seized”.

Jer 40:1 1 Similarly, when all the Judaeans living in Moab, with the Ammonites, in Edom and elsewhere, heard
that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan
as their governor,

Jer 40:12 the Judaeans all came back from wherever they had been driven. On their return to the land of Judah,
to Gedaliah at Mizpah, they harvested an immense quantity of wine and summer fruit.

Jer 40:13 Now Johanan son of Kareah and all the military leaders still in the field, came to Gedaliah at Mizpah
Jer 40:14 and said to him, “Are you aware that Baalis king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah
to assassinate you?”. But Gedaliah son of Ahikam would not believe them.

Jer 40:15 Johanan son of Kareah then spoke in secret to Gedaliah at Mizpah, as follows: “Please let me go and
kill Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and no one will be any the wiser. Why should he assassinate you and cause the
dispersal of all the Judaeans who have rallied round you. Why should the remnant of Judah perish?”.

Jer 40:16 But Gedaliah son of Ahikam replied to Johanan son of Kareah, “You will do no such thing, for what
you say about Ishmael is false”.

Jer 41:1 In the seventh month, however, Ishmael son of Nethaniah son of Elishama, who was of royal descent,
came with officers of the king and ten men to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah. And as they were taking their
meal together, there at Mizpah,

Jer 41 :2 Ishmael son of Nethaniah stood up with his ten men, and attacking Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of



Shaphan, with their swords, they killed the man whom the king of Babylon had made governor of the country.

Jer 41 :3 And all the Judaeans who were with him, that is with Gedaliah at Mizpah, and the Chaldaean soldiers
who happened to be there, Ishmael killed too.

Jer 41 :4 On the day after the murder of Gedaliah, before the news had become known,

Jer 41 :5 eighty men arrived from Shechem, Shiloh and Samaria, with their beards shaved off, their clothing torn,
and covered in self-inflicted gashes; they were bringing cereal offerings and incense with them to present to the
Temple of Yahweh.

Jer 41 :6 Ishmael son of Nethaniah went out of Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went. When he met them
he said, “Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam”.

Jer 41 :7 But once they were well inside the town, Ishmael son of Nethaniah slaughtered them, with the help of
his men, and had them thrown into the storage-well.

Jer 41 :8 There were ten of them, however, who said to Ishmael, “Do not kill us: we have stocks of wheat and
barley, oil and honey, hidden away in the fields”. So he spared them and did not kill them with their brothers.

Jer 41 :9 The storage-well into which Ishmael threw the corpses of all the men he had killed was a large one, the
one which King Asa had built as a precaution against Baasha king of Israel. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it
with the slaughtered men.

Jer 41:10 Ishmael then took all the rest of the people prisoner who were at Mizpah, the king’s daughters and all
the remaining people in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan, commander of the guard, had entrusted to Gedaliah son
of Ahikam. Ishmael son of Nethaniah took them prisoner and set out, intending to cross over to the Ammonites.
Jer 41:11 When Johanan son of Kareah and all the military leaders who were with him heard about all the
crimes committed by Ishmael son of Nethaniah,

Jer 41:12 they mustered all their men and set out to attack Ishmael son of Nethaniah. They caught up with him
at the great Pool of Gibeon.

Jer 41:13 At the sight of Johanan son of Kareah and all the military leaders with him, all the people with Ishmael
were delighted.

Jer 41:14 All the people whom Ishmael had taken as prisoners from Mizpah turned about, went back and joined
Johanan son of Kareah.

Jer 41:15 Ishmael son of Nethaniah, however, escaped from Johanan with eight of his men and fled to the
Ammonites.

Jer 41:16 Johanan son of Kareah and all the military leaders with him then rallied all the remaining people
whom Ishmael son of Nethaniah had taken as prisoners from Mizpah after killing Gedaliah son of Ahikam: men —
fighting men-women, children and eunuchs, whom they brought back from Gibeon.

Jer 41:17 Setting off, they made a halt at Khan Kimham near Bethlehem, intending to go on to Egypt,

Jer 41:18 to getaway from the Chaldaeans. They were now terrified of them, since Ishmael son of Nethaniah
had killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam whom the king of Babylon had made governor of the country.

Jer 42:1 Then all the military leaders, in particular Johanan son of Kareah and Azariah son of Hoshaiah, and all
the people from least to greatest, approached

Jer 42:2 the prophet Jeremiah and said, “Please hear our petition and intercede with Yahweh your God for us
and for all this remnant — and how few of us are left out of many, your own eyes can see-
Jer 42:3 so that Yahweh your God may show us the way we are to go and what we must do”.

Jer 42:4 The prophet Jeremiah replied, “I hear you; I will indeed pray to Yahweh your God as you ask; and
whatever answer Yahweh your God gives you, I will tell you, keeping nothing back from you”.

Jer 42:5 They in their turn said to Jeremiah, “May Yahweh be a true and faithful witness against us, if we do not
follow the instructions that Yahweh your God sends us through you.

Jer 42:6 Whether we like it or not, we shall obey the voice of Yahweh our God to whom we are sending you, so
that we may prosper by obeying the voice of Yahweh our God”.

Jer 42:7 Ten days later the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah.

Jer 42:8 He then summoned Johanan son of Kareah and all the military leaders who were with him, and all the
people from least to greatest,

Jer 42:9 and said, “Yahweh, God of Israel, to whom you deputed me to present your petition says this,

Jer 42:10 ‘If you will only stay in this country, I shall build you and not overthrow you; I shall plant you and not
uproot you, for I am sorry about the disaster I have inflicted on you.

Jer 42:1 1 Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, whom you fear now; do not fear him, Yahweh declares, for I
am with you to save you and rescue you from his clutches.

Jer 42:12 I shall take pity on you, so that he pities you and lets you return to your native soil.

Jer 42:13 But if you say: We will not stay in this country; if you disobey the voice of Yahweh your God,

Jer 42:14 and say: No, Egypt is where we shall go, where we shall not see war or hear the trumpet-call or go
short of food; that is where we want to live;

Jer 42:15 in that case, remnant of Judah, listen to Yahweh’s word: Yahweh Sabaoth, God of Israel, says this: If



you are determined to go to Egypt, and if you do go and settle there,

Jer 42:16 the sword you fear will overtake you there in Egypt, and there you will die.

Jer 42:17 Yes, all those who are determined to go to Egypt and settle there, will die by sword, famine and

plague: not a single one of them will survive or escape the disaster I shall inflict on them.

Jer 42:18 Yes, Yahweh Sabaoth, the God of Israel, says this: Just as my furious anger was poured out on the
inhabitants of Jerusalem, so will my fury be poured out on you if you go to Egypt: you will become an object of
execration and horror, a curse, a laughing-stock; and you will never see this place again’.

Jer 42:19 Remnant of Judah, Yahweh has told you, ‘Do not go into Egypt’. Understand clearly that today I have
given you a solemn warning.

Jer 42:20 You were not being sincere when you sent me to Yahweh your God and said, ‘Intercede for us with
Yahweh our God; tell us exactly what Yahweh our God says and we will do it’.

Jer 42:21 Today I have told you, but you have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh your God or any part of the

message he sent me to give you.

Jer 42:22 So understand this clearly: you will die by sword, famine and plague in the place where you want to
go and settle”.

Jer 43:1 When Jeremiah had finished telling all the people all the words of Yahweh their God, which Yahweh
their God had sent him to tell them — all the words quoted above-

Jer 43:2 Azariah son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan son of Kareah, and all those arrogant men, said to Jeremiah,
“You are lying. Yahweh our God did not send you to say, ‘Do not go to Egypt and settle there’.

Jer 43:3 It was Baruch son of Neriah, who keeps inciting you against us, to hand us over to the Chaldaeans so
that they can put us to death or deport us to Babylon”.

Jer 43:4 So neither Johanan nor any of the military leaders nor any of the people obeyed the voice of Yahweh
by staying in the country of Judah.

Jer 43:5 Instead, Johanan son of Kareah and all the military leaders led off the entire remnant of Judah, those
who had come back from all the nations where they had been driven to live in the country of Judah:

Jer 43:6 men, women, children, the royal princesses too, and every single person that Nebuzaradan
commander of the guard had left with Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, including the prophet Jeremiah
and Baruch son of Neriah.

Jer 43:7 And so, in disobedience to the voice of Yahweh, they reached Egypt and arrived at Tahpanhes.

Jer 43:8 At Tahpanhes the word of Yahweh was addressed to Jeremiah as follows,

Jer 43:9 “Take some large stones and bury them in the cement on the terrace outside the entrance of Pharaoh’s
palace in Tahpanhes, where the Judaeans can see you.

Jer 43:10 Then say to them, ‘Yahweh, God of Israel, says this: Look, I shall send for my servant
Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and he will place his throne on these stones I have buried, and spread his
canopy above them.

Jer 43:1 1 When he comes, he will defeat Egypt: Those for the plague, to the plague; those for captivity, to
captivity; those for the sword, to the sword!

Jer 43:12 ‘He will set fire to the temples of the gods of Egypt; he will burn these gods or take them prisoner; like
a shepherd wrapping his cloak round him, so he will wrap Egypt round him, and then leave without anyone
laying hands on him.

Jer 43:13 He will break the obelisks of the temple of the Sun in Egypt, and burn down the temples of the gods of
Egypt’”.

Jer 44:1 The word that came to Jeremiah for all the Judaeans living in Egypt, those, that is, living in Migdol,
Tahpanhes, Noph and the territory of Pathros.

Jer 44:2 “Yahweh Sabaoth, God of Israel, says this, ‘You have seen all the disaster I have brought on
Jerusalem and all the towns of Judah; today they lie in ruins and uninhabited.

Jer 44:3 This was because of the wicked deeds they committed to provoke my anger, by going and offering
incense and serving other gods whom neither they, nor you, nor your ancestors knew anything about,

Jer 44:4 although I urgently and untiringly sent you all my servants the prophets to say: You must not do this
loathsome thing, which I hate.

Jer 44:5 But they would not listen or pay attention, and turn from their wickedness and stop offering incense to
other gods.

Jer 44:6 And so my furious anger overflowed, burning down the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem,
which were reduced to ruins and wasteland, as they still are today.

Jer 44:7 And now, Yahweh, God Sabaoth, God of Israel, says this: Why bring complete disaster on yourselves
by cutting yourselves off from Judah — your men, women, children and babes in arms — so as to leave
yourselves no remnant,

Jer 44:8 by provoking my wrath by your actions, offering incense to other gods in Egypt where you have come
to settle, as though bent on your own destruction and on becoming a curse and a laughing-stock for all the



nations of the earth?

Jer 44:9 Have you forgotten the wicked deeds of your ancestors, of the kings of Judah and of your princes, your
own wicked deeds and those of your wives, committed in the country of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
Jer 44:10 To this day they have felt neither contrition nor fear; they have not observed my Law or my statutes,
which I prescribed for you, as for your ancestors.

Jer 44:1 1 So, Yahweh Sabaoth, God of Israel, says this: Look, I have determined on disaster and shall destroy
Judah completely.

Jer 44:12 I shall take the remnant of Judah who were determined to come to Egypt and settle there, and in
Egypt they will perish; they will fall to the sword or perish of famine, from least to greatest; by sword and famine
they will die and be an object of execration and horror, a curse, a laughing-stock.

Jer 44:13 I shall punish those who live in Egypt just as I punished Jerusalem: by sword, famine and plague.

Jer 44:14 Of the remnant of Judah which has come to settle in Egypt, not a single one will escape or survive to
return to the country of Judah where they long to return and live. For none of them will return, except a few
refugees’”.

Jer 44:15 At this, all the men who knew that their wives offered incense to other gods, and all the women who
were standing there, a great crowd (and all the people living in Egypt, in Pathros), answered Jeremiah as
follows,

Jer 44:16 “We have no intention of listening to the word you have just spoken to us in Yahweh’s name,

Jer 44:17 but intend to go on doing all we have vowed to do: offering incense to the Queen of Heaven and
pouring libations in her honour, as we used to do, we and our ancestors, our kings and our chief men, in the
towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem: we had food in plenty then, we lived well, we suffered no disasters.
Jer 44:18 But since we gave up offering incense to the Queen of Heaven and pouring libations in her honour,
we have been destitute and have perished either by sword or by famine.

Jer 44:19 Besides, when we offer incense to the Queen of Heaven and pour libations in her honour, do you
think we make cakes for her with her features on them, and pour libations to her, without our husbands’
knowledge?”.

Jer 44:20 To all the people, men and women, all those who had made this answer, Jeremiah retorted,

Jer 44:21 “The incense you offered in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, you, your ancestors,
your kings, your chief men and the people at large — was this not what Yahweh kept remembering, and found so
repellent

Jer 44:22 that Yahweh could not endure your misdeeds and your loathsome practices any longer, with the result
that your country has become the uninhabited ruin, the object of horror and cursing it is today?

Jer 44:23 Because you offered incense, because you sinned against Yahweh, refusing to listen to the voice of
Yahweh, or to observe his Law, his statutes and his decrees — that is why the present disaster has overtaken
you”.

Jer 44:24 Further, Jeremiah said to all the people, and particularly to all the women, “Listen to the word of
Yahweh, all you Judaeans in Egypt,

Jer 44:25 Yahweh Sabaoth, God of Israel, says this, ‘You and your wives, what your mouths promised, your
hands have indeed performed! You said: We shall punctiliously fulfil the vows we have made and offer incense
to the Queen of Heaven and pour libations in her honour. Very well, keep your vows, perform them punctiliously!
Jer 44:26 But listen to the word of Yahweh, all you Judaeans living in Egypt: I swear by my great name, Yahweh
says, that my name will no longer be uttered by any man of Judah throughout Egypt; no one will say: As Lord
Yahweh lives.

Jer 44:27 No, I am going to keep my eye on them for disaster, not for prosperity, and all the Judaeans in Egypt
will perish either by the sword or by famine until they are wiped out.

Jer 44:28 Yet, though few in number, those who escape the sword will return to the country of Judah from
Egypt. Then the entire remnant of Judah which has come and settled in Egypt will know whose word comes true,
mine or theirs.

Jer 44:29 ‘And here is the sign for you, Yahweh declares, that I shall punish you in this place: so that you will
know that the words with which I threaten you will come true:

Jer 44:30 Yahweh says this: Look, I shall hand Pharaoh Hophra, king of Egypt, over to his enemies and to those
determined to kill him, just as I handed Zedekiah king of Judah over to his enemy Nebuchadnezzar king of
Babylon, who was determined to kill him’”.

Jer 45:1 The word that the prophet Jeremiah addressed to Baruch son of Neriah when the latter wrote these
words down in a book at Jeremiah’s dictation in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah,

Jer 45:2 “This is what Yahweh God of Israel says about you, Baruch!

Jer 45:3 ‘You have been thinking: what disaster for me, and Yahweh has added further grief to my troubles! I
am worn out with groaning, and find no relief!’.

Jer 45:4 Say to him as follows, ‘Yahweh says this: Now I am knocking down what I have built, am uprooting



what I have planted, over the whole country!

Jer 45:5 And you ask for special treatment! Do not ask, for I am now going to bring disaster on all humanity,
Yahweh declares, but you I shall allow to escape with your life, wherever you may go’”.

Jer 46:1 The words of Yahweh that were addressed to the prophet Jeremiah against the nations.

Jer 46:2 On Egypt. Against the army of Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt, which was at Carchemish on the River
Euphrates when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon defeated it in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king
of Judah.

Jer 46:3 Buckler and shield at the ready! Onward to battle!

Jer 46:4 Harness the horses: into the saddle, horsemen! To your ranks! On with your helmets! Sharpen your
spears, put on your breastplates!

Jer 46:5 Why do I see them retreating, panic-stricken? Their heroes, beaten back, are fleeing headlong, with not
a look behind. Terror on every side, Yahweh declares!

Jer 46:6 No flight for the swift, no escape for the strong! Up in the north on the River Euphrates, they have
collapsed, have fallen.

Jer 46:7 Who was it rose like the Nile, his waters foaming like a torrent?

Jer 46:8 Why, Egypt rose like the Nile, his waters foaming like a torrent. “I shall rise”, he said, “and drown the
earth; sweep away town and its inhabitants!

Jer 46:9 Charge, horses! Forward, chariots! Let the warriors advance, men from Cush and Put with shield in
hand, men from Lud who bend the bow!”.

Jer 46:10 For this is the Day of Lord Yahweh Sabaoth, a day of vengeance when he takes revenge on his foes:
the sword will devour until gorged, until drunk with their blood, for Lord Yahweh Sabaoth is holding a sacrificial
feast in the land of the north, on the River Euphrates.

Jer 46:1 1 Go up to Gilead and fetch balm, virgin daughter of Egypt! You multiply remedies in vain, nothing can
cure you!

Jer 46:12 The nations have heard of your shame, your wailing fills the world, for warrior has stumbled against
warrior, and both have fallen together.

Jer 46:13 The word that came from Yahweh to the prophet Jeremiah when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
advanced to attack Egypt.

Jer 46:14 Publish it in Egypt, proclaim it in Migdol, proclaim it in Noph and Tahpanhes! Say, “Stand your ground,
be prepared, for the sword is devouring all round you!”.

Jer 46:15 Why has Apis fled? Why has your Mighty One not stood firm? Why, Yahweh has overturned him,

Jer 46:16 he has caused many to fall! Falling over one another, they say, “Up, and back to our own people, to
the country where we were born, away from the devastating sword!”.

Jer 46:17 They have given Pharaoh king of Egypt the nickname, “Much-noise-but-he-lets-the-chance-slip-by'!

Jer 46:18 As I live, the King declares, whose name is Yahweh Sabaoth, he is coming, a very Tabor among
mountains, a Carmel high above the sea!

Jer 46:19 Get your bundle ready for exile, fair inhabitant of Egypt! Noph will be reduced to a desert, desolate,
uninhabited.

Jer 46:20 Egypt was a splendid heifer, but a gadfly from the north has settled on her.

Jer 46:21 The mercenaries she had with her, these too were like fattened calves: but they too have taken to
their heels, have all run away, not held their ground, for their day of disaster has overtaken them, their time for
being punished.

Jer 46:22 Hear her hissing like a snake as they advance in force to fall on her with their axes, like woodcutters,
Jer 46:23 they will fell her forest, Yahweh declares, however impenetrable it was for they are more numerous
than locusts, there is no counting them.

Jer 46:24 The daughter of Egypt is put to shame, handed over to a people from the north.

Jer 46:25 Yahweh Sabaoth, God of Israel, has said, “Look, I shall punish Amon of No, Pharaoh, Egypt, its gods,
its kings, Pharaoh and those who put their trust in him.

Jer 46:26 I shall hand him over to those who are determined to kill him, to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, to
his generals. But afterwards, Egypt will be inhabited again as in the past, Yahweh declares.

Jer 46:27 But do not be afraid, my servant Jacob, Israel, do not be alarmed: for look, I shall rescue you from
afar and your descendants from the country where they are captive. Jacob will return and be at peace, secure,
with no one to trouble him.

Jer 46:28 Do not be afraid, my servant Jacob, Yahweh declares, for I am with you: I shall make an end of all the
nations where I have driven you, but I shall not make an end of you, I shall discipline you only as you deserve,
not leaving you quite unpunished.

Jer 47:1 The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah about the Philistines before Pharaoh attacked Gaza.

Jer 47:2 “Yahweh says this: Look, the waters are rising from the north to become an overwhelming flood,
overwhelming the country and all in it, the town and its inhabitants! People cry for help, and there is wailing from



all the country’s inhabitants

Jer 47:3 at the thunder of his chargers’ hoofs, the crash of his chariots, the grinding of his wheels. Fathers forget
about their children, their hands fall limp

Jer 47:4 because the day has come for all the Philistines to be destroyed, for Tyre and Sidon to be stripped to
the last of their allies. Yes, Yahweh is destroying the Philistines, the remnant from the Isle of Caphtor.

Jer 47:5 Baldness has befallen Gaza, Ashkelon has been reduced to silence. You who remain in the valley, how
long will you gash yourselves?

Jer 47:6 Oh, sword of Yahweh, how long before you rest? Back into your scabbard, stop, keep still!

Jer 47:7 Yet how can it rest when Yahweh has given it an order, Ashkelon and the sea coast, the targets
assigned to it?

Jer 48:1 On Moab. Yahweh, God of Israel, says this: Wretched Nebo, for it has been ravaged, Kiriathaim has
been shamed and taken, shame and distraction on the citadel,

Jer 48:2 the pride of Moab is no more! At Heshbon they plotted her downfall, “Come, let us put an end to her as
a nation!”. And you too, inhabitants of Madmen, will be silenced, the sword will be after you.

Jer 48:3 A cry of agony goes up from Horonaim, “Devastation! Dire calamity.

Jer 48:4 Moab has been shattered”, the agonised cries of her little ones ring out.

Jer 48:5 Up the slope of Luhith, weeping they go. On the road down to Horonaim is heard the shriek of disaster,
Jer 48:6 “Away! Flee for your lives like the wild donkey into the desert!”.

Jer 48:7 Yes, since you relied on your deeds and your wealth, you will be captured too. Chemosh will go into
exile, with all his priests and princes.

Jer 48:8 The despoiler will descend on every town, not one will escape; the Valley will be ravaged, the Plain be
plundered as Yahweh has said.

Jer 48:9 Give Moab wings so that she can fly away, for her towns will be laid in ruins where no one will ever live
again.

Jer 48:10 (Accursed be he who does Yahweh’s work negligently! Accursed be he who deprives his sword of
blood!)

Jer 48:1 1 From his youth Moab lived at ease, he settled on his lees, never having been decanted, never having
gone into exile: and so he kept his own flavour, his aroma was unchanged.

Jer 48:12 And so the days are coming, Yahweh declares, when I shall send him decanters to decant him; they
will empty his pitchers and break his wine jars to bits.

Jer 48:13 Moab will be shamed by Chemosh then, as the House of Israel was shamed by Bethel in which they
put their trust.

Jer 48:14 How can you say, “We are heroes, sturdy fighting men'?

Jer 48:15 Moab has been ravaged, his cities scaled, the flower of his youth goes down to the slaughter,
declares the King, whose name is Yahweh Sabaoth.

Jer 48:16 Moab’s ruin is coming soon, his downfall comes at top speed.

Jer 48:17 Grieve for him, all you living near him, all you who knew his name. Say, “How shattered it is, that
mighty rod, that splendid sceptre!”.

Jer 48:18 Come down from your glory, sit on the parched ground, daughter of Dibon, for the despoiler of Moab
has advanced on you, he has destroyed your strongholds.

Jer 48:19 Stand by the roadside, keep watch, daughter of Aroer. Question fugitive and runaway, ask, “What has
happened?”.

Jer 48:20 “Moab has been shattered and shamed. Wail and shriek! Shout along the Arnon, Moab has been laid
waste!”.

Jer 48:21 Judgement has also come on the Plain, on Holon, Jahzah, Mephaath,

Jer 48:22 Dibon, Nebo, Beth-Diblathaim,

Jer 48:23 Kiriathaim, Beth-Gamul, Beth-Meon,

Jer 48:24 Kerioth, Bozrah, and all the towns of Moab, far and near.

Jer 48:25 Moab’s horn has been cut off, his arm is broken, Yahweh declares.

Jer 48:26 Make him drunk! He has set himself up against Yahweh; let Moab wallow in his vomit and become a
laughing-stock in his turn.

Jer 48:27 Was Israel not a laughing-stock to you? Was he caught red-handed with the thieves, for you to shake
your head whenever you mention him?

Jer 48:28 Leave the towns, make the rocks your home, inhabitants of Moab. Learn from the dove that makes its
nest in the walls of the gaping gorge.

Jer 48:29 We have heard about Moab’s pride, so very proud! What arrogance! What pride! What conceit! What
a haughty heart!

Jer 48:30 -I know all about his presumption, Yahweh declares, his empty boasting, those empty deeds of his!

Jer 48:31 -and so I lament for Moab, for all Moab I raise my cry and mourn for the people of Kir-Heres.



Jer 48:32 More than for Jazer I weep for you, vineyard of Sibmah: your shoots stretched beyond the sea, they
reached all the way to Jazer. On your harvest and vintage the despoiler has descended.

Jer 48:33 Gladness and joy have vanished from the orchards of Moab. I have dried up the wine in the presses,
the treader of grapes treads no more, the joyful shouting has ceased.

Jer 48:34 The cries of Heshbon and Elealeh can be heard as far as Jahaz. The shrieks resound from Zoar to
Horonaim and Eglath-Shelishiyah, for even the Waters of Nimrim have become a wasteland.

Jer 48:35 And in Moab I shall make an end, Yahweh declares, of anyone offering sacrifice on the high places
and anyone offering incense to his gods.

Jer 48:36 That is why my heart sobs like a flute for Moab, sobs like a flute for the people of Kir-Heres, since the
wealth he had acquired is lost.

Jer 48:37 Yes, every head is shaved, every beard cut off, gashes are on every hand, sackcloth round every
waist.

Jer 48:38 On all the housetops of Moab and in all its squares there is nothing but lamenting, for I have broken
Moab like an unwanted pot, Yahweh declares.

Jer 48:39 How shattered he is! Wail! Moab so shamefully in retreat! Moab has become a laughing-stock, a thing
of horror to all his neighbours.

Jer 48:40 For Yahweh says this: (Look, like an eagle, he will hover, spreading his wings over Moab.)

Jer 48:41 The towns have been captured, the strongholds seized. (And the heart of Moab’s warriors, that day,
will be like that of a woman in labour pains.)

Jer 48:42 Moab will be destroyed, no longer a people, for setting itself up against Yahweh.

Jer 48:43 Terror, the pit and the snare for you, inhabitant of Moab, Yahweh declares.

Jer 48:44 And anyone who escapes from terror will fall into the pit, and anyone who climbs out of the pit will be
caught in the snare. Yes, I shall bring all this on Moab when the year comes for punishing them, Yahweh
declares.

Jer 48:45 In the shelter of Heshbon the fugitives have paused, exhausted. But fire will burst from Heshbon, a
flame from the palace of Sihon, consuming the brows of Moab, the head of a turbulent brood.

Jer 48:46 Disaster for you, Moab! The people of Chemosh are lost! For your sons have been taken into exile
and your daughters into captivity.

Jer 48:47 But I shall bring back Moab’s captives in the final days, Yahweh declares. Thus far the judgement on
Moab.

Jer 49:1 To the Ammonites. Yahweh says this: Has Israel no sons? Has he no heir? Why should Milcom have
inherited Gad and his people have settled in its towns?

Jer 49:2 And so the days are coming, Yahweh declares, when I shall make the war cry ring out for Rabbah-of-
the-Ammonites. She will become a desolate mound and her daughter towns will be burnt down. Then Israel will
inherit from his heirs, Yahweh says.

Jer 49:3 Wail, Heshbon, for Ar has been laid waste! Shriek, daughters of Rabbah! Wrap yourself in sackcloth,
raise the dirge, run to and fro among the sheep-pens! For Milcom is going into exile, with all his priests and
princes.

Jer 49:4 How you used to glory in your Valley, rebellious daughter, confident in your resources, “Who will dare to
attack me?”.

Jer 49:5 Look, I shall bring terror on you, Lord Yahweh Sabaoth declares, from all directions; you shall be driven
away, everyone for himself, with no one to rally the fugitives.

Jer 49:6 (But later I shall bring back the captive Ammonites, Yahweh declares.)

Jer 49:7 To Edom. Yahweh says this: Is there no wisdom left in Teman? Have the shrewd run out of
commonsense, has their wisdom vanished?

Jer 49:8 Away! Take to your heels! Go into hiding, inhabitants of Dedan, for I shall bring ruin on Esau when the
time comes for me to punish him.

Jer 49:9 If grape-pickers were to come to you, would they not leave a few gleanings? If robbers came during the
night, would they not steal only as much as they wanted?

Jer 49:10 But I for my part have stripped Esau, have laid his hiding places bare: he can hide no longer. His race
is destroyed, so are his brothers and neighbours; he is no more!

Jer 49:1 1 Leave your orphans, I shall support them, and let your widows rely on me!

Jer 49:12 For Yahweh says this, “Look, those who would not have had to drink the cup will have to drink it all the
same; so why should you go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, but will certainly have to drink.

Jer 49:13 For by my own self I have sworn, Yahweh declares, that Bozrah will become an object of horror, a
laughing-stock, a desert, a curse, and all its towns ruins for ever”.

Jer 49:14 I have received a message from Yahweh, a herald has been sent throughout the nations, “Muster!
March against this people! Prepare for battle!”.

Jer 49:15 For look, I shall reduce you to the smallest of nations, to the most despised of people.



Jer 49:16 Your reputation for ferocity, your proud heart has misled you. You whose home is in the crannies of
the Rock, who cling to the top of the peak! Though you make your nest as high as the eagle’s, I shall bring you
down from there, Yahweh declares.

Jer 49:17 Edom will become an object of horror; everyone going near will be appalled, and whistle at the sight of
all her wounds.

Jer 49:18 As at the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbouring towns, no one will live there any
more, Yahweh says, no human being settle there again.

Jer 49:19 Look, like a lion he climbs from the thickets of the Jordan to the perennial pasture! In a flash, I shall
make them run away, and there appoint someöne I shall choose. For who is there like me? Who can hale me
into court? Name me the shepherd who can stand up to me.

Jer 49:20 So now hear the plan that Yahweh has laid against Edom, the schemes he has in mind against the
inhabitants of Teman: they will certainly be dragged away like the smallest of the flock! Their pastures will
certainly be sacked before their eyes!

Jer 49:21 The earth quakes at the sound of their downfall, the sound of it echoes to the Sea of Reeds.

Jer 49:22 Look, like an eagle, he will soar and hover, spreading his wings over Bozrah. And the heart of Edom’s
warriors, that day, will be like that of a woman in labour pains.

Jer 49:23 To Damascus. Hamath and Arpad are shamed, for they have heard bad news. They are convulsed
with anxiety like the sea that cannot be calmed.

Jer 49:24 Damascus is aghast, she prepares for flight, she is seized with trembling (anguish and sorrow have
laid hold on her as on a woman in labour).

Jer 49:25 What now! That famous town deserted, that city of gaiety?

Jer 49:26 And so in her squares her young men will fall, and all her fighting men will perish, that day, Yahweh
Sabaoth declares.

Jer 49:27 I shall light a fire inside the walls of Damascus, to devour the palaces of Ben-Hadad.

Jer 49:28 To Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor, which were conquered by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.
Yahweh says this: Up! March on Kedar, destroy the sons of the east!

Jer 49:29 Let their tents and their flocks be captured, their tent-cloths and all their gear; let their camels be
seized and the shout go up, “Terror on every side!”.

Jer 49:30 Away! Get into hiding as fast as you can, inhabitants of Hazor, Yahweh declares, for Nebuchadnezzar
king of Babylon has made a plan against you, he has a scheme in mind against you,

Jer 49:31 Up! March on a nation at its ease, living secure, Yahweh declares, that has no gates, no bars, that
lives in a remote place!

Jer 49:32 Their camels will be the plunder, their countless sheep the spoil. I shall scatter them to the winds,
those Crop-Heads, and bring ruin on them from every side, Yahweh declares.

Jer 49:33 Hazor will become the lair of jackals, desolate for ever. No one will live there any more, no human
being settle there again.

Jer 49:34 The word of Yahweh that came to the prophet Jeremiah about Elam, at the beginning of the reign of
Zedekiah king of Judah.

Jer 49:35 “Yahweh Sabaoth says this: Look, I shall break Elam’s bow, the source of his might.

Jer 49:36 I shall bring four winds on Elam from the four corners of the sky, and I shall scatter them to all these
winds: there will not be a single nation to which people expelled from Elam do not go.

Jer 49:37 I shall make the Elamites tremble before their enemies, before those determined to kill them. I shall
bring disaster on them, my burning anger, Yahweh declares. I shall pursue them with the sword until I have
destroyed them all.

Jer 49:38 I shall set up my throne in Elam, uprooting its king and princes, Yahweh declares.

Jer 49:39 In the final days, I shall bring Elam’s captives back, Yahweh declares”.

Jer 50:1 The word that Yahweh spoke against Babylon, against the country of the Chaldaeans, through the
prophet Jeremiah.

Jer 50:2 Announce it to the nations, proclaim it, hoist a signal and proclaim it, making no secret of it, say,
“Babylon is captured, Bel disgraced, Marduk shattered. (Her idols are disgraced, her Obscenities shattered.)”

Jer 50:3 For a nation is marching on her from the north, to turn her country into a desert: no one will live there
any more; human and animal have fled and gone.

Jer 50:4 In those days and at that time the people of Israel will return (they and the people of Judah); they will
come weeping in search of Yahweh their God.

Jer 50:5 They will ask the way to Zion and turn their faces towards her, “Come, let us bind ourselves to Yahweh
by an everlasting covenant never to be forgotten!”.

Jer 50:6 Lost sheep, such were my people; their shepherds led them astray, the mountains misled them; from
mountain to hill they went, forgetful of their fold.

Jer 50:7 Whoëver came across them devoured them, their enemies said, “We are not to blame, since they have



sinned against Yahweh, the Home of Justice, against Yahweh, the Hope of their ancestors”.

Jer 50:8 Escape from Babylon, leave the country of the Chaldaeans. Be like he-goats, leading the sheep!

Jer 50:9 For look, I shall raise a league of mighty nations to attack Babylon, from the land of the north. They will
take up position against her; by them she will be taken. Their arrows, like an experienced soldier’s, never return
in vain.

Jer 50:10 Chaldaea will be plundered, all her plunderers will be satisfied, Yahweh declares.

Jer 50:1 1 Rejoice! Have your triumph, you plunderers of my heritage! Be playful like a heifer let out to grass!
Neigh like stallions!

Jer 50:12 But your mother is covered with shame, disgraced is the woman who bore you; she is the least of
nations now; a desert, a parched land, a wasteland.

Jer 50:13 Because of Yahweh’s anger, no one will live there any more, she will become a total solitude. All who
pass by Babylon will be appalled and whistle at the sight of all her wounds.

Jer 50:14 Take position against Babylon, surround her, all you who bend the bow. Shoot at her! Do not spare
your arrows, for she has sinned against Yahweh!

Jer 50:15 Raise the war cry against her from all sides. She surrenders! Her bastions fall! Her walls collapse!

This is Yahweh’s vengeance! Take revenge on her. Treat her as she has treated others.

Jer 50:16 Deprive Babylon of the man who sows, of the man who wields the sickle at harvest. Away from the
devastating sword, let everyone return to his own people, let everyone flee to his own country!

Jer 50:17 Israel was a straying sheep pursued by lions. First, the king of Assyria devoured him, and latterly
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon crunched his bones.

Jer 50:18 So Yahweh Sabaoth, God of Israel, says this: Look, I shall punish the king of Babylon and his country
as I punished the king of Assyria.

Jer 50:19 I will bring Israel back to his pastures to browse on Carmel and in Bashan, on the highlands of
Ephraim and in Gilead, and he will be satisfied.

Jer 50:20 In those days and at that time, Yahweh declares, you may look for Israel’s guilt, it will not be there, for
Judah’s sins, you will not find them, for I shall pardon the remnant that I leave.

Jer 50:21 March on the country of Merathaim, march on it and on the inhabitants of Pekod; slaughter and curse
with destruction every last one of them, Yahweh declares, carry out my orders to the letter!

Jer 50:22 The din of battle fills the country, immense destruction.

Jer 50:23 How utterly shattered that hammer of the whole world! What a thing of horror Babylon has become
throughout the nations!

Jer 50:24 I set a snare for you, Babylon; you were caught before you knew it. You have been found and
overpowered for having defied Yahweh.

Jer 50:25 Yahweh has opened his armoury and taken out the weapons of his fury. For Lord Yahweh Sabaoth
has work to do in the country of the Chaldaeans.

Jer 50:26 Fall on her from every side, open her granaries, pile her in heaps, curse her with destruction, until
nothing is left of her.

Jer 50:27 Slaughter all her bulls, down to the slaughterhouse with them! Disaster on them, their day has come,
their time for being punished.

Jer 50:28 Listen! Fugitives and runaways from the country of Babylon arrive in Zion and proclaim the revenge of
Yahweh our God, revenge for his Temple!

Jer 50:29 Call up the archers against Babylon! All you who bend the bow, invest her on all sides, leave her no
way of escape. Repay her as her deeds deserve; treat her as she has treated others, for she was arrogant to
Yahweh, to the Holy One of Israel.

Jer 50:30 And so in her squares her young men will fall, and all her fighting men will perish, that day, Yahweh
declares.

Jer 50:31 My quarrel is with you, “Arrogance!”. Lord Yahweh Sabaoth declares, your day has come, the time for
me to punish you.

Jer 50:32 “Arrogance” will stumble, she will fall, no one will lift her up: I shall set fire to her towns and it will
devour all around it.

Jer 50:33 Yahweh Sabaoth says this: The people of Israel are oppressed (and the people of Judah too), all their
captors hold them fast, they will not let them go.

Jer 50:34 But their redeemer is strong: Yahweh Sabaoth is his name. He will take up their cause, to give our
country rest but make the inhabitants of Babylon tremble.

Jer 50:35 A sword against the Chaldaeans, Yahweh declares, against the inhabitants of Babylon, against her
princes and her sages!

Jer 50:36 A sword against her diviners: may they lose their wits! A sword against her warriors: may they panic!
Jer 50:37 A sword against her horses, her chariots and the conglomeration of people inside her: may they be
like women! A sword against her treasures: may they be plundered!



Jer 50:38 Drought on her waters: may they dry up! For it is a country of idols, and they are mad about those
bogeys of theirs!

Jer 50:39 Hence wild cats and jackals will live there, and ostriches make their home there. She will never again
be inhabited, for ever, but remain uninhabited age after age.

Jer 50:40 As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and their neighbouring towns, Yahweh declares, no
one will live there any more, no human being settle there again.

Jer 50:41 Look, a people is coming from the north, a mighty nation; from the far ends of the earth many kings
are stirring.

Jer 50:42 They are armed with bow and spear, they are cruel and pitiless; their noise is like the roaring of the
sea; they ride horses, ready as one man to fight you, daughter of Babylon!

Jer 50:43 The king of Babylon has heard the news, his hands fall limp, anguish has seized him, pain like that of
a woman in labour.

Jer 50:44 Look, like a lion he climbs the thickets of the Jordan to the perennial pasture! In a flash I shall make
them run away and there appoint someöne I shall choose. For who is there like me? Who can hale me into
court? Name me the shepherd who can stand up to me.

Jer 50:45 So now hear the plan that Yahweh has laid against Babylon, the schemes he has in mind against the
country of the Chaldaeans: they will certainly be dragged away like the smallest in the flock! Their pastures will
certainly be sacked before their eyes!

Jer 50:46 The earth quakes at the sound of Babylon’s capture, and the shouting echoes through the nations.
Jer 51:1 Yahweh says this: Against Babylon and the inhabitants of Leb-Kamai I shall rouse a destructive wind.
Jer 51 :2 I shall send winnowers to Babylon to winnow her and leave her country bare, for she will be
beleaguered on all sides, on the day of disaster.

Jer 51 :3 Let no archer bend his bow! Let no man swagger in his breastplate!-No quarter for her young men!
Curse her whole army with destruction!

Jer 51 :4 In the country of the Chaldaeans the slaughtered will fall, in the streets of Babylon, those run through
by the sword.

Jer 51 :5 For Israel and Judah have not been bereft of their God, Yahweh Sabaoth, although their country was
full of sin against the Holy One of Israel.

Jer 51 :6 Escape from Babylon (save your lives, each one of you); do not perish for her guilt, for now is the time
for Yahweh’s vengeance: he will pay her her reward!

Jer 51 :7 Babylon was a golden cup in Yahweh’s hand, she made the whole world drunk, the nations drank her
wine and then went mad.

Jer 51 :8 Babylon has suddenly fallen, is broken: wail for her! Fetch balm for her wounds, perhaps she can be
cured!

Jer 51 :9 -'We tried to cure Babylon; she has got no better. Leave her alone and let us each go to his own
country”. -Yes, her sentence reaches to the sky, rises to the very clouds.

Jer 51:10 Yahweh has shown the uprightness of our cause. Come, let us tell in Zion what Yahweh our God has
done.

Jer 51:11 Sharpen the arrows, fill the quivers! Yahweh has roused the spirit of the kings of the Medes, because
he has a plan against Babylon to destroy it; this is Yahweh’s revenge, revenge for his Temple.

Jer 51:12 Against the walls of Babylon raise the standard! Strengthen the guard! Post the sentries! Take up
concealed positions! For Yahweh has both planned and done what he promised he would to the inhabitants of
Babylon.

Jer 51:13 Enthroned beside abundant waters, rich in treasures, you now meet your end, the finish of your
pillaging.

Jer 51:14 By his own self Yahweh Sabaoth has sworn: I shall fill you with men as though with grasshoppers,
and over you they will raise the triumph-shout.

Jer 51:15 By his power he made the earth, by his wisdom set the world firm, by his discernment spread out the
heavens.

Jer 51:16 When he thunders there is a roaring of waters in heaven; he raises clouds from the furthest limits of
the earth, makes the lightning flash for the downpour, and brings the wind from his storehouse.

Jer 51:17 At this everyone stands stupefied, uncomprehending, every goldsmith blushes for his idols; his
castings are but delusion, with no breath in them.

Jer 51:18 They are futile, a laughable production, when the time comes for them to be punished, they will
vanish.

Jer 51:19 The Heritage of Jacob is not like these, for he is the maker of everything, and Israel is the tribe that is
his heritage; His name is Yahweh Sabaoth.

Jer 51:20 You were my mace, a weapon of war. With you I crushed nations, struck kingdoms down,

Jer 51 :21 with you crushed horse and rider, with you crushed chariot and charioteer,



Jer 51 :22 with you crushed man and woman, with you crushed old man and young, with you crushed young
man and girl,

Jer 51 :23 with you crushed shepherd and flock, with you crushed ploughman and team, with you crushed
governors and magistrates,

Jer 51 :24 and I shall repay Babylon and the inhabitants of Chaldaea, before your eyes, for all the wrongs they
have done to Zion, Yahweh declares.

Jer 51 :25 I am setting myself against you, mountain of destruction, Yahweh declares, destroyer of the whole
world! I shall reach out my hand for you and send you tumbling from the crags and make you a burnt-out
mountain.

Jer 51 :26 No corner-stone will be taken from you again and no foundation-stone, for you will be a desert for
ever, Yahweh declares.

Jer 51 :27 Raise the standard throughout the world, sound the trumpet among the nations! Consecrate nations
to make war on her; summon kingdoms against her: Ararat, Minni, Ashkenaz; appoint a recruiting-officer for her
enemies, bring up the cavalry, bristling like locusts.

Jer 51 :28 Consecrate nations to make war on her: the kings of Media, her governors, all her magistrates and
the whole territory under their rule.

Jer 51 :29 Then the earth trembled and writhed, for Yahweh’s plan against Babylon was being executed: to
change the country of Babylon into an unpopulated desert.

Jer 51 :30 The warriors of Babylon have done with fighting, they have stayed inside their fortresses; their
courage exhausted, they are now like women. Her houses are on fire, her gates are shattered.

Jer 51 :31 Courier follows close on courier, messenger on messenger, to tell the king of Babylon that his city has
been taken from all sides,

Jer 51 :32 the fords occupied, the bastions burnt down and the fighting men seized with panic.

Jer 51 :33 For Yahweh Sabaoth, the God of Israel, says this: the daughter of Babylon is like a threshing-floor
when it is being trodden: a little while, and then the time for harvesting her will come.

Jer 51 :34 He devoured me, consumed me, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, left me like an empty dish, like the
Dragon he has swallowed me whole, filled his belly with my titbits and threw me out.

Jer 51 :35 “On Babylon be the wounds I suffered!”. the daughter of Zion will say. “On the inhabitants of Chaldaea
be my blood!”. Jerusalem will say.

Jer 51 :36 So, Yahweh says this: Look, I am taking up your cause to make sure you are avenged. I shall dry her
river up, make her springs run dry.

Jer 51 :37 Babylon will become a heap of stones, the lair of jackals, a thing of horror and of scorn, with no one
living in it.

Jer 51 :38 Like lions they roar together, they growl like lions’ whelps.

Jer 51 :39 Are they feverish? I will prepare them a drink and make them drink until they are tipsy and fall into an
everlasting sleep, never to wake again, Yahweh declares.

Jer 51 :40 I will drag them away to the slaughterhouse like lambs, like rams and goats.

Jer 51 :41 What! Has Sheshak been taken, been conquered, the pride of the whole world? What a thing of horror
Babylon has become throughout the nations!

Jer 51 :42 The sea has risen over Babylon, she sinks beneath its boisterous waves.

Jer 51 :43 Her towns have been turned into wasteland, a parched land, a desert, a country where no one lives
and where nobody goes.

Jer 51 :44 I shall punish Bel in Babylon and make him disgorge what he has swallowed. In future the nations will
stream to him no more. The very walls of Babylon will fall.

Jer 51 :45 Get out of her, my people; save your lives, each one of you, from Yahweh’s furious anger.

Jer 51 :46 But do not be faint-hearted! Do not take fright at rumours hawked round the country: one rumour
spreads one year, next year another follows; violence rules on earth and one tyrant succeeds another.

Jer 51 :47 So look, the days are coming when I shall punish the idols of Babylon. Her entire country will be
humbled, with all her slaughtered lying on home-soil.

Jer 51 :48 The heaven and earth and all within them will shout for joy over Babylon, for the destroyers from the
north are coming to her, Yahweh declares.

Jer 51 :49 Babylon in her turn must fall, you slaughtered ones of Israel, just as through Babylon there fell men
slaughtered all over the world.

Jer 51 :50 You who have escaped her sword, leave her, do not wait! Remember Yahweh from afar, let
Jerusalem come into your mind.

Jer 51 :51 -'We were ashamed when we heard of the outrage, we were covered in confusion because foreigners
had entered the Temple of Yahweh’s holy places”.

Jer 51 :52 -So look, the days are coming, Yahweh declares, when I shall punish her idols, and the wounded will
groan throughout her country.



Jer 51 :53 Were Babylon to scale the heavens or reinforce her towering citadel, destroyers would still come to
her on my orders, Yahweh declares.

Jer 51 :54 The din of shouting from Babylon, of immense destruction, from the country of the Chaldaeans!

Jer 51 :55 Yes, Yahweh is laying Babylon waste and silencing her monstrous din, whose waves used to roar like
the ocean and their tumultuous voices rang out.

Jer 51 :56 For the destroyer has fallen on Babylon, her warriors are captured, their bows are broken. Yes,
Yahweh is a God of retribution, he never fails to repay.

Jer 51 :57 I shall make her princes and her sages drink, her governors, her magistrates, her warriors; they will
fall into an everlasting sleep, never to wake again, declares the King, whose name is Yahweh Sabaoth.

Jer 51 :58 Yahweh Sabaoth says this: The walls of Babylon the Great will be razed to the ground, and her lofty gates will be burnt down. Thus peoples toil for nothing and nations wear themselves out, for the flames.

Jer 51 :59 This is the order that the prophet Jeremiah gave to Seraiah son of Neriah, son of Mahseiah when
Seraiah left for Babylon with Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year of his reign. Seraiah was lord
chamberlain.

Jer 51 :60 Now, on one sheet, Jeremiah had written down the entire disaster that was to befall Babylon, that is,
all these words recorded here against Babylon.

Jer 51 :61 Jeremiah then said to Seraiah, “When you reach Babylon, see to it that you read all these words
aloud.

Jer 51 :62 Then say, ‘You, Yahweh, have promised to destroy this place, so that no one will live here ever again,
neither human nor animal, and it will be desolate for ever’.

Jer 51 :63 Then, when you have finished reading this sheet, tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of the
Euphrates,

Jer 51 :64 with the words, ‘So shall Babylon sink, never to rise again from the disaster which I am going to bring
on her’. 1 Thus far the words of Jeremiah.

Jer 52:1 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he came to the throne, and he reigned for eleven years in
Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamital daughter of Jeremiah, of Libnah.

Jer 52:2 He did what is displeasing to Yahweh, just as Jehoiakim had done.

Jer 52:3 That this should happen to Jerusalem and Judah was due to Yahweh’s anger, resulting in his casting
them away from his presence. Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.

Jer 52:4 In the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadnezzar king
of Babylon advanced on Jerusalem with his entire army; he pitched camp in front of the city and threw up
earthworks round it.

Jer 52:5 The city lay under siege till the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.

Jer 52:6 In the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, when famine was raging in the city and there was no
food for the populace,

Jer 52:7 a breach was made in the city wall. The king and all the fighting men then fled, leaving the city under
cover of dark, by way of the gate between the two walls, which is near the king’s garden — the Chaldaeans had
surrounded the city — and made his way towards the Arabah.

Jer 52:8 The Chaldaean troops pursued the king and caught up with Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, where all
his troops deserted.

Jer 52:9 But the Chaldaeans captured the king and took him to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the territory of
Hamath, where he passed sentence on him.

Jer 52:10 He had Zedekiah’s sons slaughtered before his eyes; he also had all the chief men of Judah put to
death at Riblah.

Jer 52:1 1 He then put out Zedekiah’s eyes and, loading him with chains, the king of Babylon carried him off to
Babylon where he kept him prisoner until his dying day.

Jer 52:12 In the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month — it was in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar
king of Babylon — Nebuzaradan commander of the guard, a member of the king of Babylon’s staff, entered
Jerusalem.

Jer 52:13 He burnt down the Temple of Yahweh, the royal palace and all the houses in Jerusalem.

Jer 52:14 The Chaldaean troops who accompanied the commander of the guard demolished all the walls
surrounding Jerusalem.

Jer 52:15 Nebuzaradan commander of the guard deported (some of the poor people and) the remainder of the
population left in the city, the deserters who had gone over to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the artisans.

Jer 52:16 But Nebuzaradan commander of the guard left some of the poor country-people behind as vineyard
workers and ploughmen.

Jer 52:17 The Chaldaeans broke up the bronze pillars from the Temple of Yahweh, the wheeled stands and the
bronze Sea, which were in the Temple of Yahweh, and took all the bronze away to Babylon.

Jer 52:18 They also took the ash containers, the scoops, the knives, the sprinkling bowls, the incense bowls,



and all the bronze furnishings used in worship.

Jer 52:19 The commander of the guard also took the bowls, the censers, the sprinkling bowls, the ash
containers, the lamp-stands, the goblets and the saucers: everything that was made of gold and everything
made of silver.

Jer 52:20 As regards the two pillars, the one Sea, the twelve bronze oxen supporting the Sea, and the wheeled
stands, which King Solomon had made for the Temple of Yahweh, there was no reckoning the weight of bronze
in all these objects.

Jer 52:21 As regards the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits, its circumference was twelve
cubits, it was four fingers thick, and hollow inside;

Jer 52:22 on it stood a capital of bronze, the height of the capital being five cubits; round the capital were filigree
and pomegranates, all in bronze. So also for the second pillar.

Jer 52:23 There were ninety-six pomegranates round the sides, making a hundred pomegranates round the
filigree in all.

Jer 52:24 The commander of the guard took prisoner Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest next in rank,
and the three guardians of the threshold.

Jer 52:25 In the city he took prisoner an official who was in command of the fighting men, seven of the king’s
personal friends who were discovered in the city, the secretary to the army commander responsible for military
conscription, and sixty men of distinction discovered in the city.

Jer 52:26 Nebuzaradan commander of the guard took these men and brought them to the king of Babylon at
Riblah,

Jer 52:27 and at Riblah, in the territory of Hamath, the king of Babylon had them put to death. Thus Judah was
deported from its country.

Jer 52:28 The number of people deported by Nebuchadnezzar was as follows. In the seventh year: three
thousand and twenty-three Judaeans;

Jer 52:29 in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, eight hundred and thirty-two persons were deported from
Jerusalem;

Jer 52:30 in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan commander of the guard deported seven
hundred and forty-five Judaeans. In all: four thousand six hundred persons.

Jer 52:31 But in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the
twenty-fifth day of the month, Evil-Merodach king of Babylon, in the year he came to the throne, pardoned
Jehoiachin king of Judah and released him from prison.

Jer 52:32 He treated him kindly and allotted him a seat above those of the other kings who were with him in
Babylon.

Jer 52:33 So Jehoiachin laid aside his prisoner’s garb and for the rest of his life always ate at the king’s table.
Jer 52:34 And his upkeep was permanently ensured by the king, day after day, for the rest of his life until the
day he died.

Lam 1:1 How deserted she sits, the city once thronged with people! Once the greatest of nations, she is now
like a widow. Once the princess of states, she is now put to forced labour.

Lam 1 :2 All night long she is weeping, tears running down her cheeks. Not one of all her lovers remains to
comfort her. Her friends have all betrayed her and become her enemies.

Lam 1:3 Judah has gone into exile after much pain and toil. Living among the nations she finds no respite; her
persecutors all overtake her where there is no way out.

Lam 1 :4 The roads to Zion are in mourning; no one comes to her festivals now. Her gateways are all deserted;
her priests groan; her young girls are grief-stricken; she suffers bitterly.

Lam 1 :5 Her foes now have the upper hand, her enemies prosper, for Yahweh has made her suffer for her
many, many crimes; her children have gone away into captivity driven in front of the oppressor.

Lam 1:6 And from the daughter of Zion all her splendour has departed. Her princes were like stags which could
find no pasture, exhausted, as they flee before the hunter.

Lam 1 :7 Jerusalem remembers her days of misery and distress; when her people fell into the enemy’s clutches
there was no one to help her. Her enemies looked on and laughed at her downfall.

Lam 1 :8 Jerusalem has sinned so gravely that she has become a thing unclean. All who used to honour her
despise her, having seen her nakedness; she herself groans aloud and turns her face away.

Lam 1 :9 Her filth befouls her skirts — she never thought to end like this, and hence her astonishing fall with no
one to comfort her. Yahweh, look at my misery, for the enemy is triumphant!

Lam 1:10 The enemy stretched out his hand for everything she treasured; she saw the heathen enter her
sanctuary, whom you had forbidden to enter your Assembly.

Lam 1:11 All her people are groaning, looking for something to eat; they have bartered their treasures for food,
to keep themselves alive. Look, Yahweh, and consider how despised I am!

Lam 1:12 All you who pass this way, look and see: is any sorrow like the sorrow inflicted on me, with which



Yahweh struck me on the day of his burning anger?

Lam 1:13 He sent fire from on high deep into my bones; he stretched a net for my feet, he pulled me back; he
left me shattered, sick all day long.

Lam 1:14 He has watched out for my offences, with his hand he enmeshes me, his yoke is on my neck, he has
deprived me of strength. The Lord has put me into clutches which I am helpless to resist.

Lam 1:15 The Lord has rejected all my warriors within my walls, he has summoned a host against me to crush
my young men; in the winepress the Lord trampled the young daughter of Judah.

Lam 1:16 And that is why I weep; my eyes stream with water, since a comforter who could revive me is far
away. My children are shattered, for the enemy has proved too strong.

Lam 1:17 Zion stretches out her hands, with no one to comfort her. Yahweh has commanded Jacob’s enemies
to surround him; they treat Jerusalem as though she were unclean.

Lam 1:18 Yahweh is in the right, for I rebelled against his command. Listen, all you peoples, and see my sorrow.
My young girls and my young men have gone into captivity. Qophp

Lam 1:19 I called to my lovers; they failed me. My priests and my elders expired in the city, as they searched for
food to keep themselves alive.

Lam 1:20 Look, Yahweh. I am in distress! My inmost being is in ferment; my heart turns over inside me — how
rebellious I have been! Outside, the sword bereaves; inside it is like death.

Lam 1 :21 Listen, for I am groaning, with no one to comfort me. All my enemies have heard of my disaster, they
are glad about what you have done. Bring the Day you once foretold, so that they may be like me!

Lam 1 :22 Let all their wickedness come before you, and treat them as you have treated me for all my crimes;
numberless are my groans, and I am sick at heart.

Lam 2:1 In his anger, with what darkness has the Lord enveloped the daughter of Zion! He has flung the beauty
of Israel from heaven to the ground, without regard for his footstool on the day of his anger.

Lam 2:2 The Lord pitilessly engulfed all the homes of Jacob; in his fury he tore down the fortresses of the
daughter of Judah; he threw to the ground, he desecrated the kingdom and its princes.

Lam 2:3 In his burning anger he broke all the might of Israel, withdrew his protecting right hand at the coming of
the enemy, and blazed against Jacob like a fire that burns up everything near it.

Lam 2:4 Like an enemy he bent his bow, and his right hand held firm; like a foe he slaughtered all those who
were a delight to see; on the tent of the daughter of Zion he poured out his fury like fire.

Lam 2:5 The Lord behaved like an enemy; he engulfed Israel, he engulfed all its citadels, he destroyed its
fortresses and for the daughter of Judah multiplied weeping on wailing.

Lam 2:6 He wrecked his domain like a garden, destroyed his assembly-points, Yahweh erased the memory of
festivals and Sabbaths in Zion; in the heat of his anger he treated king and priest with contempt.

Lam 2:7 The Lord has rejected his altar, he has come to loathe his sanctuary and has given her palace walls
into the clutches of the enemy; from the uproar they made in Yahweh’s temple it might have been a festival day!
Lam 2:8 Yahweh has resolved to destroy the walls of the daughter of Zion, stretching out the line, not staying
his hand until he has engulfed everything, thus bringing mourning on wall and rampart; alike they crumbled.

Lam 2:9 Her gates have sunk into the ground; he has broken and shattered their bars. Her king and her princes
are among the gentiles, there is no instruction, furthermore her prophets cannot find any vision from Yahweh.
Lam 2:10 Mute, they sit on the ground, the elders of the daughter of Zion; they have put dust on their heads and
wrapped themselves in sackcloth. The young girls of Jerusalem bow their heads to the ground.

Lam 2:1 1 My eyes are worn out with weeping, my inmost being is in ferment, my heart plummets at the
destruction of my young people, as the children and babies grow faint in the streets of the city.

Lam 2:12 They keep saying to their mothers, “Where is some food?”. as they faint like wounded men in the
streets of the city, as they breathe their last on their mothers’ breasts.

Lam 2:13 To what can I compare or liken you, daughter of Jerusalem? Who can rescue and comfort you, young
daughter of Zion? For huge as the sea is your ruin: who can heal you?

Lam 2:14 The visions your prophets had for you were deceptive whitewash; they did not lay bare your guilt so
as to change your fortunes: the visions they told you were deceptive.

Lam 2:15 All who pass your way clap their hands at the sight; they whistle and shake their heads over the
daughter of Jerusalem, “Is this the city they call Perfection of Beauty, the joy of the whole world?”.

Lam 2:16 Your enemies open their mouths in chorus against you; they whistle and grind their teeth; they say,
“We have swallowed her up. This is the day we were waiting for; at last we have seen it!”.

Lam 2:17 Yahweh has done what he planned, has carried out his threat, as he ordained long ago: he has
destroyed without pity, increasing the might of your foes — and letting your foes get the credit.

Lam 2:18 Cry then to the Lord, rampart of the daughter of Zion; let your tears flow like a torrent, day and night;
allow yourself no respite, give your eyes no rest!

Lam 2:19 Up, cry out in the night-time as each watch begins! Pour your heart out like water in Yahweh’s
presence! Raise your hands to him for the lives of your children (who faint with hunger at the end of every



street)!

Lam 2:20 Look, Yahweh, and consider: whom have you ever treated like this? Should women eat their little
ones, the children they have nursed? Should priest and prophet be slaughtered in the Lord’s sanctuary?

Lam 2:21 Children and old people are lying on the ground in the streets; my young men and young girls have
fallen by the sword; you have killed them, on the day of your anger, you have slaughtered them pitilessly.

Lam 2:22 As though to a festival you called together terrors from all sides, so that, on the day of Yahweh’s
anger, none escaped and none survived. Those whom I had nursed and reared, my enemy has annihilated them
all.

Lam 3:1 I am the man familiar with misery under the rod of his fury.

Lam 3:2 He has led and guided me into darkness, not light.

Lam 3:3 Against none but me does he turn his hand, again and again, all day.

Lam 3:4 He has wasted my flesh and skin away, has broken my bones.

Lam 3:5 He has besieged me and made hardship a circlet round my head.

Lam 3:6 He has forced me to dwell where all is dark, like those long-dead in their everlasting home.

Lam 3:7 He has walled me in so that I cannot escape; he has weighed me down with chains;

Lam 3:8 even when I shout for help, he shuts out my prayer.

Lam 3:9 He has closed my way with blocks of stone, he has obstructed my paths.

Lam 3:10 For me he is a lurking bear, a lion in hiding.

Lam 3:1 1 Heading me off, he has torn me apart, leaving me shattered.

Lam 3:12 He has bent his bow and used me as a target for his arrows.

Lam 3:13 He has shot deep into me with shafts from his quiver.

Lam 3:14 I have become a joke to all my own people, their refrain all day long.

Lam 3:15 He has given me my fill of bitterness, he has made me drunk with wormwood.

Lam 3:16 He has broken my teeth with gravel, he has fed me on ashes.

Lam 3:17 I have been deprived of peace, I have forgotten what happiness is
Lam 3:18 and thought, “My lasting hope in Yahweh is lost”.

Lam 3:19 Bring to mind my misery and anguish; it is wormwood and gall!

Lam 3:20 My heart dwells on this continually and sinks within me.

Lam 3:21 This is what I shall keep in mind and so regain some hope:

Lam 3:22 Surely Yahweh’s mercies are not over, his deeds of faithful love not exhausted;

Lam 3:23 every morning they are renewed; great is his faithfulness!

Lam 3:24 “Yahweh is all I have”, I say to myself, “and so I shall put my hope in him”.

Lam 3:25 Yahweh is good to those who trust him, to all who search for him.

Lam 3:26 It is good to wait in silence for Yahweh to save.

Lam 3:27 It is good for someöne to bear the yoke from a young age,

Lam 3:28 to sit in solitude and silence when it weighs heavy,

Lam 3:29 to lay one’s head in the dust — maybe there is hope-

Lam 3:30 to offer one’s cheek to the striker, to have one’s fill of disgrace!

Lam 3:31 For the Lord will not reject anyone for ever.

Lam 3:32 If he brings grief, he will have pity out of the fullness of his faithful love,

Lam 3:33 for it is not for his own pleasure that he torments and grieves the human race.

Lam 3:34 When all the prisoners in a country are crushed underfoot,

Lam 3:35 when human rights are overridden in defiance of the Most High,

Lam 3:36 when someöne is cheated of justice, does not the Lord see it?

Lam 3:37 Who has only to speak and it is so done? Who commands, if not the Lord?

Lam 3:38 From where, if not from the mouth of the Most High, do evil and good come?

Lam 3:39 Why then should anyone complain? Better to be bold against one’s sins.

Lam 3:40 Let us examine our path, let us ponder it and return to Yahweh.

Lam 3:41 Let us raise our hearts and hands to God in heaven.

Lam 3:42 We are the ones who have sinned, who have rebelled, and you have not forgiven.

Lam 3:43 You have enveloped us in anger, pursuing us, slaughtering without pity.

Lam 3:44 You have wrapped yourself in a cloud too thick for prayer to pierce.

Lam 3:45 You have reduced us to rubbish and refuse among the nations.

Lam 3:46 Our enemies open their mouths in chorus against us.

Lam 3:47 Terror and pitfall have been our lot, ravage and ruin.

Lam 3:48 My eyes dissolve in torrents of tears at the ruin of my beloved people.

Lam 3:49 My eyes will weep ceaselessly, without relief,

Lam 3:50 until Yahweh looks down and sees from heaven.

Lam 3:51 My eyes have grown sore over all the daughters of my city.



Lam 3:52 Unprovoked, my enemies hunted me down like a bird.

Lam 3:53 They shut me finally in a pit, they closed me in with a stone.

Lam 3:54 The waters rose over my head; I thought, “I am lost!”.

Lam 3:55 Yahweh, I called on your name from the deep pit.

Lam 3:56 You heard my voice, do not close your ear to my prayer, to my cry.

Lam 3:57 You are near when I call to you. You said, “Do not be afraid!”.

Lam 3:58 Lord, you defended my cause, you have redeemed my life.

Lam 3:59 Yahweh, you have seen the wrong done to me, grant me redress.

Lam 3:60 You have seen their vindictiveness, all their plots against me.

Lam 3:61 You have heard their insults, Yahweh, all their plots against me,

Lam 3:62 the whispering and murmuring of my enemies against me all day long.

Lam 3:63 Look, whether they sit or stand, I am their refrain.

Lam 3:64 Yahweh, repay them as their deeds deserve.

Lam 3:65 Lay hardness of heart as your curse on them.

Lam 3:66 Angrily pursue them, root them out from under your heavens!

Lam 4:1 How the gold has tarnished, how the fine gold has changed! The sacred stones lie scattered at the
corner of every street.

Lam 4:2 The children of Zion, as precious as finest gold — to think that they should now be reckoned like
crockery made by a potter!

Lam 4:3 The very jackals give the breast, and suckle their young: but the daughter of my people is as cruel as
the ostriches of the desert.

Lam 4:4 The tongue of the baby at the breast sticks to its palate for thirst; little children ask for bread, no one
gives them any.

Lam 4:5 Those who used to eat only the best, now lie dying in the streets; those who were reared in the purple
claw at the rubbish heaps,

Lam 4:6 for the wickedness of the daughter of my people exceeded the sins of Sodom, which was overthrown in
a moment without a hand being laid on it.

Lam 4:7 Once her young people were brighter than snow, whiter than milk; rosier than coral their bodies, their
hue like sapphire.

Lam 4:8 Now their faces are blacker than soot, they are not recognised in the streets, the skin has shrunk over
their bones, as dry as a stick.

Lam 4:9 Happier those killed by the sword than those killed by famine: they waste away, sunken for lack of the
fruits of the earth.

Lam 4:10 With their own hands, kindly women cooked their children; this was their food when the daughter of
my people was ruined.

Lam 4:1 1 Yahweh indulged his fury, he vented his fierce anger, he lit a fire in Zion which devoured her
foundations.

Lam 4:12 The kings of the earth never believed, nor did any of the inhabitants of the world, that foe or enemy
would ever penetrate the gates of Jerusalem.

Lam 4:13 Owing to the sins of her prophets and the crimes of her priests, who had shed the blood of the upright,
in the heart of the city,

Lam 4:14 they wandered blindly through the streets, polluted with blood, so that no one dared to touch their
clothes.

Lam 4:15 “Keep away! Unclean!”. people shouted, “Keep away! Keep away! Don’t touch!”. If they left and fled to
the nations, they were not allowed to stay there either.

Lam 4:16 The face of Yahweh destroyed them, he will look on them no more. There was no respect for the
priests, no deference for the elders.

Lam 4:17 Continually we were wearing out our eyes, watching for help — in vain. From our towers we watched
for a nation which could not save us anyway.

Lam 4:18 Men dogged our steps, to keep us out of our streets. Our end was near, our days were done, our end
had come.

Lam 4:19 Our pursuers were swifter than eagles in the sky; they hounded our steps through the mountains, they
lay in ambush for us in the wilds.

Lam 4:20 The breath of our nostrils, Yahweh’s anointed, was caught in their traps, he of whom we said, “In his
shadow we shall live among the nations”.

Lam 4:21 Rejoice, exult, daughter of Edom, you who reside in Uz! To you in turn the cup will pass; you will get
drunk and strip yourself naked!

Lam 4:22 Your wickedness is atoned for, daughter of Zion, he will never banish you again. But your wickedness,
daughter of Edom, will he punish, your sins he will lay bare!



Lam 5:1 Yahweh, remember what has happened to us; consider, and see our degradation.

Lam 5:2 Our heritage has passed to strangers, our homes to foreigners.

Lam 5:3 We are orphans, we are fatherless; our mothers are like widows.

Lam 5:4 We have to buy our own water to drink, our own wood we can get only at a price.

Lam 5:5 The yoke is on our necks; we are persecuted; exhausted we are, allowed no rest.

Lam 5:6 We made a pact with Egypt, with Assyria, to have plenty of food.

Lam 5:7 Our ancestors sinned; they are no more, and we bear the weight of their guilt.

Lam 5:8 Slaves rule us; there is no one to rescue us from their clutches.

Lam 5:9 At peril of our lives we earn our bread, by risking the sword of the desert.

Lam 5:10 Our skin is as hot as an oven, from the scorch of famine.

Lam 5:11 The women in Zion have been raped, the young girls in the towns of Judah.

Lam 5:12 Princes have been hanged by their hands; the face of the old has won no respect.

Lam 5:13 Youths have been put to the mill, boys stagger under loads of wood.

Lam 5:14 The elders have deserted the gateway; the young have given up their music.

Lam 5:15 Joy has vanished from our hearts; our dancing has turned to mourning.

Lam 5:16 The crown has fallen from our heads. Alas that ever we sinned!

Lam 5:17 This is why our hearts are sick; this is why our eyes are dim:

Lam 5:18 because Mount Zion is desolate; jackals roam to and fro on it.

Lam 5:19 Yet you, Yahweh, rule from eternity; your throne endures from age to age.

Lam 5:20 Why do you never remember us? Why do you abandon us so long?

Lam 5:21 Make us come back to you, Yahweh, and we will come back. Restore us as we were before!

Lam 5:22 Unless you have utterly rejected us, in an anger which knows no limit.

Bar 1:1 This is the text of the book written in Babylon by Baruch son of Neraiah, son of Mahseiah, son of
Zedekiah, son of Hasadiah, son of Hilkiah,

Bar 1 :2 in the fifth year, on the seventh day of the month, at the time when the Chaldaeans had captured
Jerusalem and burned it down.

Bar 1 :3 Baruch read the text of this book aloud to Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and to all the
people who had come to hear the reading,

Bar 1 :4 to the nobles and the sons of the king, and to the elders; to the whole people, that is, to the least no less
than to the greatest, to all who lived in Babylon beside the river Sud.

Bar 1 :5 On hearing it they wept, fasted and prayed before the Lord;

Bar 1 :6 and they collected as much money as each could afford

Bar 1 :7 and sent it to Jerusalem to the priest Jehoiakim son of Hilkiah, son of Shallum, and the other priests,
and all the people who were with him in Jerusalem.

Bar 1 :8 Also on the tenth day of Sivan he was given the utensils of the house of the Lord, which had been
removed from the Temple, to take them back to the land of Judah; these were silver utensils which Zedekiah son
of Josiah, king of Judah, had had made

Bar 1 :9 after Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had deported Jeconiah from Jerusalem to Babylon, together with
the princes, the metalworkers, the nobles and the common people.

Bar 1:10 Now, they wrote, we are sending you money to pay for burnt offerings, offerings for sin, and incense.
Prepare oblations and offer them on the altar of the Lord our God;

Bar 1:11 and pray for the long life of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and of his son Belshazzar, that they may
endure on earth as long as the heavens endure;

Bar 1:12 and that the Lord may give us strength and enlighten our eyes, so that we may lead our lives under the
protection of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and of his son Belshazzar, and that we may serve them for a long
time and win their favour.

Bar 1:13 Also pray to the Lord our God for us, because we have sinned against him, and the anger, the fury of
the Lord, has still not turned away from us.

Bar 1:14 Lastly, you must read the booklet which we are sending you, publicly in the house of the Lord on the
feastday and appropriate days.

Bar 1:15 You must say: Saving justice is the Lord’s, we have only the look of shame we bear, as is the case
today for the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem,

Bar 1:16 for our kings and princes, our priests, our prophets, and for our ancestors,

Bar 1:17 because we have sinned before the Lord,

Bar 1:18 have disobeyed him, and have not listened to the voice of the Lord our God telling us to follow the
commandments which the Lord had ordained for us.

Bar 1:19 From the day when the Lord brought our ancestors out of Egypt until today we have been disobedient
to the Lord our God, we have been disloyal, refusing to listen to his voice.

Bar 1 :20 And we are not free even today of the disasters and the curse which the Lord pronounced through his



servant Moses the day he brought our ancestors out of Egypt to give us a land flowing with milk and honey.

Bar 1 :21 We have not listened to the voice of the Lord our God in all the words of those prophets he sent us;

Bar 1:22 but, each following the dictates of our evil heart, we have taken to serving alien gods, and doing what
is displeasing to the Lord our God.

Bar 2:1 And so the Lord has carried out the sentence which he passed on us, on our judges who governed
Israel, on our kings and leaders and on the people of Israel and of Judah;

Bar 2:2 what he did to Jerusalem has never been paralleled under the wide heavens — in conformity with what
was written in the Law of Moses;

Bar 2:3 we were each reduced to eating the flesh of our own sons and daughters.

Bar 2:4 Furthermore, he has handed them over into the power of all the kingdoms that surround us, to be the
contempt and execration of all the neighbouring peoples among whom the Lord scattered them.

Bar 2:5 Instead of being masters, they found themselves enslaved, because we had sinned against the Lord our
God by not listening to his voice.

Bar 2:6 Saving justice is the Lord's; we and our ancestors have only the look of shame we bear today.

Bar 2:7 All those disasters which the Lord pronounced against us have now befallen us.

Bar 2:8 And yet we have not tried to win the favour of the Lord by each of us renouncing the dictates of our own
wicked heart;

Bar 2:9 so the Lord has been alert to our misdeeds and has brought disaster down on us, since the Lord is
upright in everything he had commanded us to do,

Bar 2:10 and we have not listened to his voice so as to follow the commandments which the Lord had ordained
for us.

Bar 2:1 1 And now, Lord, God of Israel, who brought your people out of Egypt with a mighty hand, with signs and
wonders, with great power and with outstretched arm, to win yourself a name such as you have today,

Bar 2:12 we have sinned, we have committed sacrilege; Lord our God, we have broken all your precepts.

Bar 2:13 Let your anger turn from us since we are no more than a little remnant among the nations where you
have dispersed us.

Bar 2:14 Listen, Lord, to our prayers and our entreaties; deliver us for your own sake and let us win the favour of
the people who have deported us,

Bar 2:15 so that the whole world may know that you are the Lord our God, since Israel and his descendants
bear your name.

Bar 2:16 Look down, Lord, from your holy dwelling-place and think of us, bow your ear and listen,

Bar 2:17 open your eyes, Lord, and look; the dead down in Sheol, whose breath has been taken from their
bodies, are not the ones to give glory and due recognition to the Lord;

Bar 2:18 whoëver is overcome with affliction, who goes along bowed down and frail, with failing eyes and
hungering soul, that is the one to give you glory and due recognition, Lord.

Bar 2:19 We do not rely on the merits of our ancestors and of our kings to offer you our humble plea, Lord our
God.

Bar 2:20 No, you have sent down your anger and your fury on us, as you threatened through your servants the
prophets when they said,

Bar 2:21 The Lord says this: Bend your necks and serve the king of Babylon, and you will remain in the country
which I gave to your ancestors.

Bar 2:22 But if you do not listen to the voice of the Lord and serve the king of Babylon

Bar 2:23 then I shall silence the shouts of rejoicing and mirth and the voices of bridegroom and bride in the

towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, and the whole country will be reduced to desert, with no

inhabitants”.

Bar 2:24 But we would not listen to your voice and serve the king of Babylon, and so you carried out what you
had threatened through your servants the prophets: that the bones of our kings and of our ancestors would be
dragged from their resting places.

Bar 2:25 They were indeed tossed out to the heat of the day and the frost of the night. And people died in
dreadful agony, from famine, sword and plague.

Bar 2:26 And so, because of the wickedness of the House of Israel and the House of Judah, you have made
this House, that bears your name, what it is today.

Bar 2:27 And yet, Lord our God, you have treated us in a way worthy of all your goodness and boundless
tenderness,

Bar 2:28 just as you had promised through your servant Moses, the day you told him to write your Law in the
presence of the Israelites, and said,

Bar 2:29 “If you do not listen to my voice, this great and innumerable multitude will certainly be reduced to a tiny
few among the nations where I shall scatter them-

Bar 2:30 for I knew that, being an obstinate people, they would not listen to me. But in the country of their exile,



they will come to themselves

Bar 2:31 and acknowledge that I am the Lord their God. I shall give them a heart and an attentive ear,

Bar 2:32 and they will sing my praises in the country of their exile, they will remember my name;

Bar 2:33 they will stop being obstinate and, remembering what became of their ancestors who sinned before the
Lord, will turn from their evil deeds.

Bar 2:34 Then I shall bring them back to the country which I promised on oath to their ancestors Abraham, Isaac
and Jacob, and make them masters in it. I shall make their numbers grow; they will not dwindle again.

Bar 2:35 And I shall make an everlasting covenant with them; so that I am their God and they are my people.
And never again shall I drive my people Israel out of the country which I have given them”.

Bar 3:1 Almighty Lord, God of Israel, a soul in anguish, a troubled heart now cries to you:

Bar 3:2 Listen and have pity, Lord, for we have sinned before you.

Bar 3:3 You sit enthroned for ever, while we are perishing for ever.

Bar 3:4 Almighty Lord, God of Israel, hear the prayer of the dead of Israel, of the children of those who have
sinned against you and have not listened to the voice of the Lord their God; hence the disasters which dog us.
Bar 3:5 Do not call to mind the misdeeds of our ancestors, but remember instead your power and your name.
Bar 3:6 You are indeed the Lord our God and we will praise you, Lord,

Bar 3:7 since you have put respect for you in our hearts to encourage us to call on your name. We long to
praise you in our exile, for we have rid our hearts of the wickedness of our ancestors who sinned against you.

Bar 3:8 Look, today we are still in exile where you have scattered us as something contemptible, accursed,
condemned, for all the misdeeds of our ancestors who had abandoned the Lord our God.

Bar 3:9 Listen, Israel, to commands that bring life; hear, and learn what knowledge means.

Bar 3:10 Why, Israel, why are you in the country of your enemies, growing older and older in an alien land,

Bar 3:1 1 defiling yourselves with the dead, reckoned with those who go to Sheol?

Bar 3:12 It is because you have forsaken the fountain of wisdom!

Bar 3:13 Had you walked in the way of God, you would be living in peace for ever.

Bar 3:14 Learn where knowledge is, where strength, where understanding, and so learn where length of days is,
where life, where the light of the eyes and where peace.

Bar 3:15 But who has found out where she lives, who has entered her treasure house?

Bar 3:16 Where now are the leaders of the nations and those who ruled even the beasts of earth,

Bar 3:17 those who sported with the birds of heaven, those who accumulated silver and gold on which all
people rely, and whose possessions had no end,

Bar 3:18 those who worked so carefully in silver -but of whose works no trace is to be found?

Bar 3:19 They have vanished, gone down to Sheol. Others have risen to their places,

Bar 3:20 more recent generations have seen the day and peopled the earth in their turn, but the way of

knowledge they have not found;

Bar 3:21 they have not recognised the paths she treads. Nor have their children had any grasp of her, remaining
far from her way.

Bar 3:22 Nothing has been heard of her in Canaan, nothing has been seen of her in Teman;

Bar 3:23 the children of Hagar in search of worldly wisdom, the merchants of Midian and Teman, the tale-

spinners and the philosophers have none of them found the way to wisdom or remembered the paths she
treads.

Bar 3:24 How great, Israel, is the house of God, how wide his domain,

Bar 3:25 immeasurably wide, infinitely lofty!

Bar 3:26 In it were born the giants, famous from the beginning, immensely tall, expert in war;

Bar 3:27 God’s choice did not fall on these, he did not show them the way of knowledge;

Bar 3:28 they perished for lack of wisdom, perished by their own folly.

Bar 3:29 Who has ever climbed the sky and seized her to bring her down from the clouds?

Bar 3:30 Who has ever crossed the ocean and found her to bring her back in exchange for the finest gold?

Bar 3:31 No one can learn the way to her, no one can understand the path she treads.

Bar 3:32 But the One who knows all discovers her, he has grasped her with his own intellect, he has set the

earth firm for evermore and filled it with four-footed beasts,

Bar 3:33 he sends the light — and it goes, he recalls it — and trembling it obeys;

Bar 3:34 the stars shine joyfully at their posts;

Bar 3:35 when he calls them, they answer, “Here we are”; they shine to delight their Creator.

Bar 3:36 It is he who is our God, no other can compare with him.

Bar 3:37 He has uncovered the whole way of knowledge and shown it to his servant Jacob, to Israel his well-
beloved;

Bar 3:38 only then did she appear on earth and live among human beings.

Bar 4:1 She is the book of God’s commandments, the Law that stands for ever; those who keep her shall live,



those who desert her shall die.

Bar 4:2 Turn back, Jacob, seize her, in her radiance make your way to light:

Bar 4:3 do not yield your glory to another, your privilege to a people not your own.

Bar 4:4 Israel, blessed are we: what pleases God has been revealed to us!

Bar 4:5 Take courage, my people, memorial of Israel!

Bar 4:6 You were sold to the nations, but not for extermination. You provoked God; and so were delivered to
your enemies,

Bar 4:7 since you had angered your Creator by offering sacrifices to demons, and not to God.

Bar 4:8 You had forgotten the eternal God who reared you. You had also grieved Jerusalem who nursed you,
Bar 4:9 for when she saw God’s anger falling on you, she said: Listen, you neighbours of Zion: God has sent me
great sorrow.

Bar 4:10 I have seen my sons and daughters taken into captivity, which the Eternal brought down on them.

Bar 4:1 1 I had reared them joyfully; in tears, in sorrow, I watched them go away.

Bar 4:12 Do not, any of you, exult over me, a widow, deserted by so many; I am bereaved because of the sins
of my children, who turned away from the Law of God,

Bar 4:13 who did not want to know his precepts and would not follow the ways of his commandments or tread
the paths of discipline as his justice directed.

Bar 4:14 Come here, neighbours of Zion! Remember my sons’ and daughters’ captivity, which the Eternal
brought down on them.

Bar 4: 15 How he brought a distant nation down on them, a ruthless nation speaking a foreign language, they
showed neither respect for the aged, nor pity for the child;

Bar 4:16 they carried off the widow’s cherished sons, they left her quite alone, bereft of her daughters.

Bar 4:17 For my part, how could I help you?

Bar 4:18 He who brought those disasters down on you, is the one to deliver you from your enemies’ clutches.
Bar 4:19 Go, my children, go your way! I must stay bereft and lonely;

Bar 4:20 I have taken off the clothes of peace and put on the sackcloth of entreaty; all my life I shall cry to the
Eternal.

Bar 4:21 Take courage, my children, call on God: he will deliver you from tyranny, from the clutches of your
enemies;

Bar 4:22 for I look to the Eternal for your rescue, and joy has come to me from the Holy One at the mercy soon
to reach you from your Saviour, the Eternal.

Bar 4:23 In sorrow and tears I watched you go away, but God will give you back to me in joy and gladness for
ever.

Bar 4:24 As the neighbours of Zion have now witnessed your captivity, so will they soon see your rescue by
God, which will come upon you with great glory and splendour of the Eternal.

Bar 4:25 My children, patiently bear the anger brought on you by God. Your enemy has persecuted you, but
soon you will witness his destruction and set your foot on his neck.

Bar 4:26 My favourite children have travelled by rough roads, carried off like a flock by a marauding enemy.

Bar 4:27 Take courage, my children, call on God: he who brought this on you will remember you.

Bar 4:28 As by your will you first strayed from God, so now turn back and search for him ten times harder;

Bar 4:29 for as he has been bringing down those disasters on you, so will he rescue you and give you eternal
joy.

Bar 4:30 Take courage, Jerusalem: he who gave you your name will console you.

Bar 4:31 Disaster will come to all who have ill-treated you and gloated over your fall.

Bar 4:32 Disaster will come to the cities where your children were slaves; disaster to whichever one received
your children,

Bar 4:33 for just as she rejoiced at your fall and was happy to see you ruined, so will she grieve over her own
desolation.

Bar 4:34 I shall deprive her of the joy of a populous city, and her insolence will turn to mourning;

Bar 4:35 fire from the Eternal will befall her for many a day, and demons will dwell in her for ages.

Bar 4:36 Jerusalem, turn your eyes to the east, see the joy that is coming to you from God.

Bar 4:37 Look, the children you watched go away are on their way home; reassembled from east and west, they
are on their way home at the Holy One’s command, rejoicing in God’s glory.

Bar 5:1 Jerusalem, take off your dress of sorrow and distress, put on the beauty of God’s glory for evermore,

Bar 5:2 wrap the cloak of God’s saving justice around you, put the diadem of the Eternal One’s glory on your
head,

Bar 5:3 for God means to show your splendour to every nation under heaven,

Bar 5:4 and the name God gives you for evermore will be, “Peace-through-Justice, and Glory-through-Devotion'.
Bar 5:5 Arise, Jerusalem, stand on the heights and turn your eyes to the east: see your children reassembled



from west and east at the Holy One’s command, rejoicing because God has remembered.

Bar 5:6 Though they left you on foot driven by enemies, now God brings them back to you, carried gloriously,
like a royal throne.

Bar 5:7 For God has decreed the flattening of each high mountain, of the everlasting hills, the filling of the
valleys to make the ground level so that Israel can walk safely in God’s glory.

Bar 5:8 And the forests and every fragrant tree will provide shade for Israel, at God’s command;

Bar 5:9 for God will guide Israel in joy by the light of his glory, with the mercy and saving justice which come
from him. A copy of the letter which Jeremiah sent to those about to be led captive to Babylon by the king of the
Babylonians, to tell them what he had been commanded by God:

Bar 6:1 “Because of the sins which you have committed before God you are to be deported to Babylon by
Nebuchadnezzar king of the Babylonians.

Bar 6:2 Once you have reached Babylon you will stay there for many years, as long as seven generations; after
which I shall bring you home in peace.

Bar 6:3 Now in Babylon you will see gods made of silver, of gold, of wood, being carried shoulder-high, and
filling the gentiles with fear.

Bar 6:4 Be on your guard! Do not imitate the foreigners, do not have any fear of their gods

Bar 6:5 as you see their worshippers prostrating themselves before and behind them. Instead, say in your

hearts, ‘Master, it is you that we must worship’.

Bar 6:6 For my angel is with you; your lives will be in his care.

Bar 6:7 “Overlaid with gold and silver, their tongues polished smooth by a craftsman, they are counterfeit and
have no power to speak.

Bar 6:8 As though for a girl fond of finery, these people take gold and make crowns for the heads of their gods.
Bar 6:9 And sometimes, the priests filch gold and silver from their gods to spend on themselves, even giving
some of it to the prostitutes on the terrace.

Bar 6:10 They dress up these gods of silver, gold and wood, in clothes, like human beings; on their own they
cannot protect themselves from either tarnish or woodworm;

Bar 6:11 when they have been dressed in purple cloaks, their faces have to be dusted, because of the temple
dust which settles thick on them.

Bar 6:12 One holds a sceptre like the governor of a province, yet is powerless to put to death anyone who
offends him;

Bar 6:13 another holds sword and mace in his right hand, yet is powerless to defend himself against war or
thieves.

Bar 6:14 From this it is evident that they are not gods; do not be afraid of them.

Bar 6:15 “Just as a pot in common use becomes useless once it is broken, so are these gods enshrined inside
their temples.

Bar 6:16 Their eyes are full of dust raised by the feet of those who enter.

Bar 6:17 Just as the doors are locked on all sides on someöne who has offended a king and is under sentence
of death, so the priests secure the temples of these gods with gates and bolts and bars for fear of burglary.

Bar 6:18 They light more lamps for them than they do for themselves, and the gods see none of them.

Bar 6:19 They are like one of the temple beams, which are said to be gnawed away from within; the termites
creep out of the ground and eat them and their clothes too, and they feel nothing.

Bar 6:20 Their faces are blackened by the smoke that rises from the temple.

Bar 6:21 Bats, swallows, birds of every kind perch on their bodies and heads, and so do cats.

Bar 6:22 From this, you can see for yourselves that they are not gods; do not be afraid of them.

Bar 6:23 “The gold with which they are parading their futility before the world is supposed to make them look
beautiful, but if someöne does not rub off the tarnish, these gods will not be shining much on their own, and even
while they were being cast, they felt nothing.

Bar 6:24 However much was paid for them, there is still no breath of life in them.

Bar 6:25 Being unable to walk, they have to be carried on men’s shoulders, which shows how futile they are. It
is humiliating for their worshippers, too, who have to stand them up again if they fall over.

Bar 6:26 Once they have been stood up, they cannot move on their own; if they tilt askew, they cannot right
themselves; offerings made to them might as well be made to the dead.

Bar 6:27 Whatever is sacrificed to them, the priests re-sell and pocket the profit; while their wives salt down part
of it, but give nothing to the poor or to the helpless. As to the sacrifices themselves, why, women during their
periods and women in childbed are not afraid to touch them!

Bar 6:28 From all this you can tell that they are not gods; do not be afraid of them.

Bar 6:29 “Indeed, how can they even be called gods, when women do the offering to these gods of silver, gold
and wood?

Bar 6:30 In their temples, the priests stay sitting down, their garments torn, heads and beard shaved and heads



uncovered;

Bar 6:31 they roar and shriek before their gods as people do at funeral feasts.

Bar 6:32 The priests take robes from the gods to clothe their own wives and children.

Bar 6:33 Whether these gods are treated badly or well, they are incapable of paying back either treatment; as
incapable too of making or unmaking kings,

Bar 6:34 equally incapable of distributing wealth or money. If anyone fails to honour a vow he has made to
them, they cannot call him to account.

Bar 6:35 They can neither save anyone from death nor rescue the weak from the strong,

Bar 6:36 nor restore sight to the blind, nor save anyone in trouble,

Bar 6:37 nor take pity on a widow, nor be generous to an orphan.

Bar 6:38 These wooden gods overlaid with gold and silver are about as much use as rocks cut out of the
mountain side. Their worshippers will be confounded!

Bar 6:39 So how can anyone think or say that they are gods?

Bar 6:40 The Chaldaeans themselves do them no honour; if they find someöne who is dumb and cannot speak,
they present him to Bel, entreating him for the gift of speech, as though he could perceive it!

Bar 6:41 And they are incapable of drawing the conclusion and abandoning those gods — such is their lack of
perception.

Bar 6:42 Women with strings round their waists sit in the streets, burning bran like incense;

Bar 6:43 when one of these has been picked up by a passer-by and been to bed with him, she then gloats over
her neighbour for not having been thought as worthy as herself and for not having had her string broken.

Bar 6:44 Whatever is done for them is spurious. So how can anyone think or say that they are gods?

Bar 6:45 “Made by woodworkers and goldsmiths, they are only what those workmen decide to make them.

Bar 6:46 Their makers have not long to live themselves, so how can the things they make be gods?

Bar 6:47 Their legacy to their descendants is nothing but delusion and dishonour.

Bar 6:48 If war or disasters befall them, the priests discuss where best to hide themselves and these gods;

Bar 6:49 how can anyone fail to realise that they are not gods, if they cannot save themselves from war or from
disasters?

Bar 6:50 And since they are only made of wood overlaid with gold or silver, it will later become apparent that
they are spurious; it will be obvious to everyone, to nations as to kings, that they are not gods but the work of
human hands, and that there is no divine activity in them.

Bar 6:51 Does anyone still need convincing that they are not gods?

Bar 6:52 They can neither appoint a king over a country, nor give rain to humankind,

Bar 6:53 nor regulate their own affairs, nor rescue anyone who suffers a wrong; they are as helpless as crows
between sky and ground.

Bar 6:54 If fire falls on the temple of these wooden gods overlaid with gold or silver, their priests fly to safety
while they for their part stay there like beams, to be burnt.

Bar 6:55 They cannot put up any resistance to a king or to enemies.

Bar 6:56 So how can anyone think or say that they are gods?

Bar 6:57 These wooden gods overlaid with gold or silver cannot evade thieves or marauders; strong men may
rob them of their gold and silver and make off with the robes they are dressed in; yet they are powerless to help
even themselves.

Bar 6:58 Better to be a king displaying his prowess, a household pot of use to its owner, than to be these
counterfeit gods; or merely the door of a house, protecting what is inside, than these counterfeit gods; or a
wooden pillar in a palace than these counterfeit gods.

Bar 6:59 The sun, the moon and the stars, which shine and have been given work to do, are obedient;

Bar 6:60 similarly, the lightning, as it flashes, is a fine sight; in the same way, the wind blows across every
country,

Bar 6:61 the clouds execute the order God gives them to pass over the whole earth, and the fire, sent from
above to consume mountain and forest, carries out its orders.

Bar 6:62 Now these gods are not their equals, either in beauty or in power.

Bar 6:63 So, no one can think or say that they are gods, powerless as they are to administer justice or to do
anyone any good.

Bar 6:64 Therefore, knowing that they are not gods, do not be afraid of them.

Bar 6:65 “For they can neither curse nor bless kings,

Bar 6:66 nor produce signs in heaven for the nations, nor shine like the sun, nor shed light like the moon.

Bar 6:67 The animals are better off than they are, being able to look after themselves by making for cover.

Bar 6:68 There is not the slightest shred of evidence that they are gods; so do not be afraid of them!

Bar 6:69 “Their wooden gods overlaid with gold and silver are like a scarecrow in a field of cucumbers —
protecting nothing.



Bar 6:70 Or again, their wooden gods overlaid with gold and silver are like a thorn-bush in a garden — any kind
of bird may perch on it — or like a corpse thrown out into the dark.

Bar 6:71 From the purple and linen rotting on their backs you can tell that they are not gods; and in the end,
eaten away, they will be the dishonour of the country.

Bar 6:72 Better, then, someöne upright who has no idols; dishonour will never come near him”.

Eze 1:1 In the thirtieth year, on the fifth day of the fourth month, as I was among the exiles by the River Chebar,
heaven opened and I saw visions from God.

Eze 1 :2 On the fifth of the month — it was the fifth year of exile for King Jehoiachin-

Eze 1 :3 the word of Yahweh was addressed to the priest Ezekiel son of Buzi, in Chaldaea by the River Chebar.
There the hand of Yahweh came on him.

Eze 1 :4 I looked; a stormy wind blew from the north, a great cloud with flashing fire and brilliant light round it,
and in the middle, in the heart of the fire, a brilliance like that of amber,

Eze 1 :5 and in the middle what seemed to be four living creatures. They looked like this: They were of human
form.

Eze 1 :6 Each had four faces, each had four wings.

Eze 1 :7 Their legs were straight; they had hooves like calves, glittering like polished brass.

Eze 1 :8 Below their wings, they had human hands on all four sides corresponding to their four faces and four
wings.

Eze 1 :9 They touched one another with their wings; they did not turn as they moved; each one moved straight
forward.

Eze 1:10 As to the appearance of their faces, all four had a human face, and a lion’s face to the right, and all
four had a bull’s face to the left, and all four had an eagle’s face.

Eze 1:11 Their wings were spread upwards, each had one pair touching its neighbour’s, and the other pair
covering its body.

Eze 1:12 And each one moved straight forward; they went where the spirit urged them, they did not turn as they
moved.

Eze 1:13 Between these living creatures were what looked like blazing coals, like torches, darting backwards
and forwards between the living creatures; the fire gave a brilliant light, and lightning flashed from the fire,

Eze 1:14 and the living creatures kept disappearing and reappearing like flashes of lightning.

Eze 1:15 Now, as I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel touching the ground beside each of the four-
faced living creatures.

Eze 1:16 The appearance and structure of the wheels were like glittering chrysolite. All four looked alike, and
their appearance and structure were such that each wheel seemed to have another wheel inside it.

Eze 1:17 In whichever of the four directions they moved, they did not need to turn as they moved.

Eze 1:18 Their circumference was of awe-inspiring size, and the rims of all four sparkled all the way round.

Eze 1:19 When the living creatures moved, the wheels moved beside them; and when the living creatures left
the ground, the wheels too left the ground.

Eze 1 :20 They moved in whichever direction the spirit chose to go, and the wheels rose with them, since the
wheels shared the spirit of the animals.

Eze 1 :21 When the living creatures moved on, they moved on; when the former halted, the latter halted; when
the former left the ground, the wheels too left the ground, since the wheels shared the spirit of the animals.

Eze 1 :22 Over the heads of the living creatures was what looked like a solid surface glittering like crystal,
spread out over their heads, above them,

Eze 1 :23 and under the solid surface, their wings were spread out straight, touching one another, and each had
a pair covering its body.

Eze 1 :24 I also heard the noise of their wings; when they moved, it was like the noise of flood-waters, like the
voice of Shaddai, like the noise of a storm, like the noise of an armed camp; and when they halted, they lowered
their wings;

Eze 1 :25 there was a noise too.

Eze 1 :26 Beyond the solid surface above their heads, there was what seemed like a sapphire, in the form of a
throne. High above on the form of a throne was a form with the appearance of a human being.

Eze 1 .21 I saw a brilliance like amber, like fire, radiating from what appeared to be the waist upwards; and from
what appeared to be the waist downwards, I saw what looked like fire, giving a brilliant light all round.

Eze 1 :28 The radiance of the encircling light was like the radiance of the bow in the clouds on rainy days. The
sight was like the glory of Yahweh. I looked and fell to the ground, and I heard the voice of someöne speaking to
me.

Eze 2:1 He said, “Son of man, get to your feet; I will speak to you”.

Eze 2:2 As he said these words the spirit came into me and put me on my feet, and I heard him speaking to me.
Eze 2:3 He said, “Son of man, I am sending you to the Israelites, to the rebels who have rebelled against me.



They and their ancestors have been in revolt against me up to the present day.

Eze 2:4 Because they are stubborn and obstinate children, I am sending you to them, to say, ‘Lord Yahweh
says this’.

Eze 2:5 Whether they listen or not, this tribe of rebels will know there is a prophet among them.

Eze 2:6 And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them or of what they say, though you find yourself surrounded
with brambles and sitting on scorpions. Do not be afraid of their words or alarmed by their looks, for they are a
tribe of rebels.

Eze 2:7 You are to deliver my words to them whether they listen or not, for they are a tribe of rebels.

Eze 2:8 But you, son of man, are to listen to what I say to you; do not be a rebel like that rebellious tribe. Open
your mouth and eat what I am about to give you”.

Eze 2:9 When I looked, there was a hand stretch- ing out to me, holding a scroll.

Eze 2:10 He un- rolled it in front of me; it was written on, front and back; on it was written “Lamentations, dirges
and cries of grief “.

Eze 3:1 He then said, “Son of man, eat what you see; eat this scroll, then go and speak to the House of Israel”.
Eze 3:2 I opened my mouth; he gave me the scroll to eat

Eze 3:3 and then said, “Son of man, feed on this scroll which I am giving you and eat your fill”. So I ate it, and it
tasted sweet as honey.

Eze 3:4 He then said, “Son of man, go to the House of Israel and tell them what I have said.

Eze 3:5 You are not being sent to a nation that speaks a difficult foreign language; you are being sent to the
House of Israel.

Eze 3:6 Not to big nations that speak difficult foreign languages, and whose words you would not understand —
if I sent you to them, they would listen to you;

Eze 3:7 but the House of Israel will not listen to you because it will not listen to me. The whole House of Israel is
defiant and obstinate.

Eze 3:8 But now, I am making you as defiant as they are, and as obstinate as they are;

Eze 3:9 I am making your resolution as hard as a diamond, harder than flint. So do not be afraid of them, do not
be overawed by them, for they are a tribe of rebels”.

Eze 3:10 Then he said, “Son of man, take to heart everything I say to you, listen carefully,

Eze 3:1 1 then go to your exiled countrymen and talk to them. Say to them, ‘Lord Yahweh says this’, whether
they listen or not”.

Eze 3:12 The spirit lifted me up, and behind me I heard a great vibrating sound, “Blessed be the glory of
Yahweh in his dwelling-place!”.

Eze 3:13 This was the sound of the living creatures’ wings beating against each other, and the sound of the
wheels beside them: a great vibrating sound.

Eze 3:14 The spirit lifted me up and took me, and I went, bitter and angry, and the hand of Yahweh lay heavy on
me.

Eze 3:15 I came to Tel Abib, to the exiles beside the River Chebar where they were living, and there I stayed
with them in a stupor for seven days.

Eze 3:16 After seven days the word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 3:17 “Son of man, I have appointed you as watchman for the House of Israel. When you hear a word from
my mouth, warn them from me.

Eze 3:18 If I say to someöne wicked, ‘You will die’, and you do not warn this person; if you do not speak to
warn someöne wicked to renounce evil and so save his life, it is the wicked person who will die for the guilt, but I
shall hold you responsible for that death.

Eze 3:19 If, however, you do warn someöne wicked who then fails to renounce wickedness and evil ways, the
wicked person will die for the guilt, but you yourself will have saved your life.

Eze 3:20 When someöne upright renounces uprightness to do evil and I set a trap for him, it is he who will die;
since you failed to warn him, he will die for his guilt, and the uprightness he practised will no longer be
remembered; but I shall hold you responsible for his death.

Eze 3:21 If, however, you warn someöne upright not to sin and this person does not sin, such a one will live,
thanks to your warning, and you too will have saved your life”.

Eze 3:22 While I was there the hand of Yahweh came on me; he said, “Get up, go out into the valley, and there I
shall speak to you”.

Eze 3:23 I got up and went out into the valley; the glory of Yahweh was resting there, like the glory I had seen
by the River Chebar, and I fell to the ground.

Eze 3:24 The spirit of Yahweh then entered me and put me on my feet and spoke to me. He said, “Go and shut
yourself in your house.

Eze 3:25 Son of man, you are about to be tied and bound, and unable to mix with other people.

Eze 3:26 I am going to make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth; you will be dumb, and no longer able



to reprove them, for they are a tribe of rebels.

Eze 3:27 When I speak to you, however, I shall open your mouth and then you will say to them, ‘Lord Yahweh
says this: Let anyone prepared to listen, listen; let anyone who refuses, refuse!’ — for they are a tribe of rebels”.

Eze 4:1 “For your part, son of man, take a brick and lay it in front of you; on it scratch a city, Jerusalem.

Eze 4:2 You are then to besiege it, trench round it, build earthworks, pitch camps and bring up battering-rams all
round.

Eze 4:3 Then take an iron pan and place it as though it were an iron wall between you and the city. Then fix
your gaze on it; it is being besieged and you are besieging it. This is a sign for the House of Israel.

Eze 4:4 “Lie down on your left side and take the guilt of the House of Israel on yourself. You will bear their guilt
for as many days as you lie on that side.

Eze 4:5 Allowing one day for every year of their guilt, I ordain that you bear it for three hundred and ninety days;
this is how you will bear the House of Israel’s guilt.

Eze 4:6 And when you have finished doing this, you are to lie down again, on your right side, and bear the guilt
of the House of Judah for forty days. I have set the length for you as one day for one year.

Eze 4:7 Then fix your gaze on the siege of Jerusalem, raise your bared arm and prophesy against her.

Eze 4:8 Look, I am going to tie you up and you will not be able to turn over from one side to the other until the
period of your seclusion is over.

Eze 4:9 “Now take wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet and spelt; put them all in the same pot and make them
into bread for yourself. You are to eat it for as many days as you are lying on your side — three hundred and
ninety days.

Eze 4:10 Of this food, you are to weigh out a daily portion of twenty shekels and eat it a little piece at a time.

Eze 4:11 And you are to ration the water you drink — a sixth of a <i>hin</i> — drinking that a little at a time.

Eze 4:12 You are to eat this in the form of a barley cake baked where they can see you, on human dung”.

Eze 4:13 And Yahweh said, “This is how the Israelites will have to eat their defiled food, wherever I disperse
them among the nations”.

Eze 4:14 I then said, “Lord Yahweh, my soul is not defiled. From my childhood until now, I have never eaten an
animal that has died a natural death or been savaged; no tainted meat has ever entered my mouth”.

Eze 4:15 “Very well”, he said, “I grant you cow-dung instead of human dung; you are to bake your bread on that”.
Eze 4:16 He then said, “Son of man, I am going to cut off Jerusalem’s food supply; in their extremity, the food
they eat will be weighed out; to their horror, the water they drink will be rationed,

Eze 4:17 until there is no food or water left, and they fall into a stupor and waste away because of their guilt”.

Eze 5:1 “Son of man, take a sharp sword, use it like a barber’s razor and run it over your head and beard. Then
take scales and divide the hair you have cut off.

Eze 5:2 Burn one-third inside the city, while the days of the siege are working themselves out. Then take
another third and chop it up with the sword all round the city. The last third you are to scatter to the wind, while I
unsheathe the sword behind them.

Eze 5:3 Also take a few hairs and tie them up in the folds of your cloak;

Eze 5:4 and of these again take a few, and throw them on the fire and burn them. From them fire will come on
the whole House of Israel.

Eze 5:5 “The Lord Yahweh says this, ‘This is Jerusalem, which I have placed in the middle of the nations,
surrounded with foreign countries.

Eze 5:6 She has rebelled more perversely against my observances than the nations have, and against my laws
than the surrounding countries have; for they have rejected my observances and not kept my laws’.

Eze 5:7 “Therefore, the Lord Yahweh says this, ‘Because your disorders are worse than those of the nations
round you, since you do not keep my laws or respect my observances, and since you do not respect even the
observances of the surrounding nations,

Eze 5:8 very well, the Lord Yahweh says this: I, too, am against you and shall execute my judgements on you
for the nations to see.

Eze 5:9 Because of all your loathsome practices I shall do such things as I have never done before, nor shall
ever do again.

Eze 5:10 Those of you who are parents will eat their children, and children will eat their parents. I shall execute
judgement on you and disperse what remains of you to the winds.

Eze 5:1 1 For, as I live — declares Lord Yahweh — as sure as you have defiled my sanctuary with all your horrors
and all your loathsome practices, so I too shall reject you without a glance of pity, I shall not spare you.

Eze 5:12 A third of your citizens will die of plague or starve to death inside you; a third will fall by the sword
round you; and a third I shall scatter to the winds, unsheathing the sword behind them.

Eze 5:13 I shall sate my anger and bring my fury to rest on them until I am avenged; and when I have sated my
fury on them, then they will know that I, Yahweh, spoke out of jealousy for you.

Eze 5:14 Yes, I shall reduce you to a ruin, an object of derision to the surrounding nations, in the eyes of all who



pass by.

Eze 5:15 You will be an object of derision and insults, an example, an object of amazement to the surrounding
nations, when I execute judgement on you in furious anger and furious punishments. I, Yahweh, have spoken.
Eze 5:16 On them I shall send the deadly arrows of famine, which will destroy you — for I shall send them to
destroy you; then I shall make the famine worse and cut off your food supply.

Eze 5:17 I shall send famine and wild animals on you to rob you of your children; plague and bloodshed will
sweep through you, and I shall bring the sword down on you. I, Yahweh, have spoken’”.

Eze 6:1 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 6:2 “Son of man, turn towards the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them.

Eze 6:3 Say, ‘Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Yahweh. The Lord Yahweh says this to mountains
and hills and ravines and valleys: Look, I am going to summon the sword against you and destroy your high
places.

Eze 6:4 Your altars will be wrecked, and your incense burners smashed; I shall fling your butchered inhabitants
down in front of your foul idols;

Eze 6:5 I shall lay the corpses of the Israelites in front of their foul idols and scatter their bones all round your
altars.

Eze 6:6 Wherever you live, the towns will be destroyed and the high places wrecked, to the ruin and wrecking of
your altars, the shattering and abolition of your foul idols, the smashing of your incense burners and the utter
destruction of all your works.

Eze 6:7 As the butchered fall about you, you will know that I am Yahweh.

Eze 6:8 ‘But I shall spare some of you to escape the sword among the nations, when you have been dispersed
in their lands;

Eze 6:9 and your survivors will remember me among the nations where they are held captive, since I shall have
broken their adulterous hearts for having deserted me, and destroyed their eyes for having turned adulterously
towards their foul idols. They will loathe themselves for all the wrong they have caused by their loathsome
practices.

Eze 6:10 Then they will know that I am Yahweh and that I was not talking lightly when I said that I would inflict
these disasters on them’.

Eze 6:1 1 “The Lord Yahweh says this, ‘Clap your hands, stamp your feet, and say: Alas for all the loathsome
sins of the House of Israel, which is about to fall by sword, famine and plague!

Eze 6:12 Far off, they will die by plague; near at hand they will fall by the sword; and any who survive or are
spared will die of famine. This is how I shall sate my fury on them.

Eze 6:13 Then you will know that I am Yahweh, when their butchered corpses lie among their foul idols, all
round their altars, on every high hill, on every mountain top, under every green tree, under every leafy oak,
wherever they offer a smell pleasing to all their idols.

Eze 6:14 I shall point my finger at them and reduce the country to an empty wasteland from the desert to Riblah,
everywhere they live, and they will know that I am Yahweh’”.

Eze 7:1 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 7:2 “Son of man, say, ‘Lord Yahweh says this to the land of Israel: Finished! The end is coming for the four
corners of the country.

Eze 7:3 This is the end for you; I shall unleash my anger on you, and judge you as your conduct deserves and
call you to account for all your loathsome practices.

Eze 7:4 I shall show you no pity, I shall not spare you; I shall repay you for your conduct and for the loathsome
practices in which you persist. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.

Eze 7:5 ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Disaster, a unique disaster, is coming.

Eze 7:6 The end is coming, the end is coming, it is on the move towards you, it is coming now.

Eze 7:7 Now it is your turn, you who dwell in this country. Doom is coming, the day is near; no joy now, only
tumult, on the mountains.

Eze 7:8 Now I shall soon vent my fury on you and sate my anger on you: I shall judge you as your conduct
deserves and repay you for all your loathsome practices.

Eze 7:9 I shall show neither pity nor mercy, but shall repay you for your conduct and the loathsome practices in
which you persist. Then you will know that I am Yahweh and that I strike.

Eze 7:10 ‘Now is the day, your turn has come, it has come, it appears, the sceptre has blossomed, pride is at its
peak.

Eze 7:11 Violence has risen to become the scourge of wickedness …

Eze 7:12 Doom is coming, the day is near. Neither should buyer rejoice, nor seller regret, for the fury rests on
everyone alike.

Eze 7:13 The seller will not be able to go back on his bargain; each persists in his sins; they take no defensive
measures.



Eze 7:14 The trumpet sounds, all is ready, but no one goes into battle, since my fury rests on all alike.

Eze 7:15 ‘Outside, the sword; inside, plague and famine. Whoëver is living in the countryside will die by the
sword; whoëver is living in the city will be devoured by famine and plague.

Eze 7:16 And those who escape will escape to the mountains and there, like doves of the valleys, I shall
slaughter them all, each one for his sin.

Eze 7:17 Every hand will grow limp, every knee turn to water.

Eze 7:18 They will put on sackcloth, each one trembling. Every face will be ashamed and every head be
shaved.

Eze 7:19 They will throw their silver away in the streets and their gold they will regard as a pollution; neither
their silver nor their gold will be able to save them on the day of Yahweh’s fury. Never again will they have
enough to eat, never again will they fill their bellies, since that was the occasion for their guilt.

Eze 7:20 They used to pride themselves on the beauty of their jewellery, out of which they made their
loathsome images, their horrors; so now I have made it pollute them.

Eze 7:21 I shall hand it over as plunder to foreigners, as loot to the most evil people on earth. They will profane
it.

Eze 7:22 I shall turn my face away from them, while my treasure-house is profaned and robbers will force their
way in and profane it.

Eze 7:23 ‘Forge yourself a chain; for the country is full of bloody executions and the city full of deeds of
violence,

Eze 7:24 so I shall bring the cruellest of the nations to seize their houses. I shall put an end to the pride of their
elite, and their sanctuary will be profaned.

Eze 7:25 Terror is on the way: they will look for peace and there will be none.

Eze 7:26 Disaster will follow on disaster, rumour on rumour; they will pester the prophet for a vision; the priest
will be at a loss over the law and the elders on how to advise.

Eze 7:27 The king will go into mourning, the prince be plunged in grief, the hands of the country people tremble.

I shall treat them as their conduct deserves, and judge them as their own verdicts merit. Then they will know that
I am Yahweh!’. 1

Eze 8:1 In the sixth year, on the fifth day of the sixth month, I was sitting at home and the elders of Judah were
sitting with me, when suddenly the hand of the Lord Yahweh fell on me there.

Eze 8:2 I looked, and there was a form with the appearance of a human being. Downwards from what seemed
to be the waist there was fire; and upwards from the waist there was a brilliance like the glitter of amber.

Eze 8:3 Something like a hand was stretched out and it took me by a lock of my hair; and the spirit lifted me
between heaven and earth and, in visions from God, took me to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the inner north
gate, where stands the idol that provokes jealousy.

Eze 8:4 There was the glory of the God of Israel; it looked like what I had seen in the valley.

Eze 8:5 He said, “Son of man, raise your eyes to the north”. I raised my eyes to the north, and there, to the north

of the altar gate, stood this statue of jealousy at the entrance.

Eze 8:6 He said, “Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the monstrous, loathsome things that the House
of Israel is practising here, to drive me out of my sanctuary? And you will see practices more loathsome still”.

Eze 8:7 He next took me to the entrance to the court. I looked; there was a hole in the wall.

Eze 8:8 He said, “Son of man, bore through the wall”. I bored through the wall, until I had made an opening.

Eze 8:9 He said, “Go in and look at the loathsome things they are doing inside”.

Eze 8:10 I went in and looked and there was every kind of reptile and repulsive animal, and all the foul idols of
the House of Israel, carved all round the walls.

Eze 8:11 Seventy elders of the House of Israel were worshipping the idols — among them Jaazaniah son of
Shaphan — each one with his censer in his hand, from which rose a fragrant cloud of incense.

Eze 8:12 He said, “Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the House of Israel do in the dark, each in his
personal image-shrine? They say, ‘Yahweh cannot see us; Yahweh has abandoned the country’”.

Eze 8:13 He said, “You will see them at practices more loathsome still”.

Eze 8:14 He next took me to the entrance of the north gate of the Temple of Yahweh where women were sitting, weeping for Tammuz.

Eze 8:15 He said, “Son of man, do you see that? You will see even more loathsome things than that”.

Eze 8:16 He then led me to the inner court of the Temple of Yahweh. And there, at the entrance to Yahweh’s
sanctuary, between the portico and the altar, there were about twenty-five men, with their backs to Yahweh’s
sanctuary and their faces turned towards the east. They were prostrating themselves to the east, before the
rising sun.

Eze 8:17 He said to me, “Son of man, do you see that? Is it not bad enough for the House of Judah to be doing
the loathsome things they are doing here? But they fill the country with violence and provoke my anger further;
look at them now putting that branch to their nostrils.



Eze 8:18 And so I shall react in fury; I shall show neither pity nor mercy. They may cry as loudly as they like to
me; I will not listen”.

Eze 9:1 Then he shouted loudly for me to hear, “The scourges of the city are approaching, each carrying his
weapon of destruction!”.

Eze 9:2 Immediately six men advanced from the upper north gate, each holding a deadly weapon. Among them
was a man dressed in linen, with a scribe’s ink-horn in his belt. They came in and halted in front of the bronze
altar.

Eze 9:3 The glory of the God of Israel rose from above the winged creature where it had been, towards the
threshold of the Temple. He called to the man dressed in linen with a scribe’s ink-horn in his belt
Eze 9:4 and Yahweh said to him, “Go all through the city, all through Jerusalem, and mark a cross on the
foreheads of all who grieve and lament over all the loathsome practices in it”.

Eze 9:5 I heard him say to the others, “Follow him through the city and strike. Not one glance of pity; show no
mercy;

Eze 9:6 old men, young men, girls, children, women, kill and exterminate them all. But do not touch anyone with
a cross on his forehead. Begin at my sanctuary”. So they began with the old men who were in the Temple.

Eze 9:7 He said to them, “Defile the Temple; fill the courts with corpses; then go out!”. They went out and hacked
their way through the city.

Eze 9:8 While they were hacking them down, I was left alone; I fell on my face, crying out, “Ah, Lord Yahweh,
are you going to annihilate all that is left of Israel by venting your fury on Jerusalem?”.

Eze 9:9 He said, “The guilt of the House of Israel and Judah is immense; the country is full of bloodshed, the city
full of perversity, for they say, ‘Yahweh has abandoned the country, Yahweh cannot see’.

Eze 9:10 Then, I too shall neither give one glance of pity nor show any mercy. I shall repay them for what they
have done”.

Eze 9:1 1 The man dressed in linen with the scribe’s ink-horn in his belt then came back and made his report, “I
have carried out your orders”.

Eze 10:1 Then, in vision I saw that above the solid surface over the heads of the winged creatures there was
above them something like sapphire, which seemed to be like a throne.

Eze 10:2 He then said to the man dressed in linen, “Go in between the wheels below the winged creatures; take
a handful of burning coal from between the winged creatures and scatter it over the city”. He went in as I
watched.

Eze 10:3 The winged creatures were on the right of the Temple as the man went in, and the cloud filled the
inner court.

Eze 10:4 The glory of Yahweh rose from above the winged creatures, towards the threshold of the Temple; the
Temple was filled by the cloud and the court was full of the brightness of the glory of Yahweh.

Eze 1 0:5 The noise of the winged creatures’ wings could be heard even in the outer court, like the voice of God
Almighty when he speaks.

Eze 10:6 When he had given the order to the man dressed in linen, “Take the fire from between the wheels,
between the winged creatures”, the man went in and stood by one of the wheels.

Eze 10:7 One of the winged creatures then reached his hand out towards the fire between the winged
creatures, took some of it and put it into the hands of the man dressed in linen, who took it and came out again.
Eze 10:8 There appeared to be what looked like a human hand under the winged creatures’ wings.

Eze 10:9 And I looked, and there were four wheels beside the winged creatures, one wheel beside each winged
creature, and the appearance of the wheels was like the sparkle of chrysolite.

Eze 10:10 In appearance, all four looked alike, as though each wheel had another wheel inside it.

Eze 10:1 1 In whichever of the four directions they moved, they did not need to turn as they moved, but
whichever way the head was facing there they followed; they did not turn as they moved,

Eze 10:12 and their entire bodies, their backs, their hands, their wings, as well as the wheels, had eyes all the
way round (the wheels of all four).

Eze 10:13 In my hearing, these wheels were called “galgal'.

Eze 10:14 Each had four faces; the first was a winged creature’s face, the second a human face, the third a
lion’s face and the fourth an eagle’s face.

Eze 10:15 The winged creatures rose; this was the being I had seen by the River Chebar.

Eze 10:16 When the winged creatures moved, the wheels moved beside them; and when the winged creatures
raised their wings to leave the ground, the wheels did not turn beside them.

Eze 10:17 When the former halted the latter halted; when the former rose, the latter rose with them, since they
shared the same living spirit.

Eze 10:18 The glory of Yahweh then came out over the Temple threshold and paused over the winged
creatures.

Eze 10:19 These raised their wings and rose from the ground as I watched, and the wheels were beside them.



They paused at the entrance to the east gate of the Temple of Yahweh, with the glory of the God of Israel over
them, above.

Eze 10:20 This was the winged creature I had seen beneath the God of Israel by the River Chebar; I knew that
they were winged creatures.

Eze 1 0:21 Each had four faces and four wings and what seemed to be human hands under their wings.

Eze 10:22 Their faces were like those I had seen by the River Chebar. Each one moved straight forward.

Eze 1 1:1 The spirit lifted me up and brought me to the east gate of the Temple of Yahweh, the gate that looks
eastwards. There at the entrance to the gate stood twenty-five men, among whom I saw Jaazaniah son of Azzur
and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, leaders of the people.

Eze 1 1 :2 He said to me, “Son of man, these are the wicked schemers who are spreading their bad advice
through this city.

Eze 1 1 :3 They say, ‘There will be no house-building yet awhile. The city is the cooking pot and we are the
meat’.

Eze 1 1 :4 So prophesy against them, prophesy, son of man!”.

Eze 1 1 :5 The spirit of Yahweh fell on me, and he said to me, “Say, ‘Yahweh says this: I know what you are
saying, House of Israel, I know how insolent you are.

Eze 1 1 :6 You have filled this city with more and more of your victims; you have strewn its streets with victims.
Eze 1 1 :7 And so the Lord Yahweh says this: Your victims, whom you have put in it, are the meat, and the city is
the cooking pot; but I shall take you out of it.

Eze 1 1 :8 You are afraid of the sword and I shall bring the sword down on you — declares the Lord Yahweh-
Eze 1 1 :9 and I shall take you out of it and hand you over to foreigners and bring you to justice;

Eze 11:10 you will fall by the sword on the soil of Israel; I shall execute justice on you, and you will know that I
am Yahweh.

Eze 11:11 This city will be no cooking pot for you, nor will you be the meat inside; I shall execute justice on you
on the soil of Israel;

Eze 11:12 and you will know that I am Yahweh, whose laws you have not obeyed and whose judgements you
have not kept; instead, you have adopted the customs of the nations round you’”.

Eze 11:13 Now as I was prophesying, Pelatiah son of Benaiah dropped dead. I fell to the ground and cried out,
“Ah, Lord Yahweh, are you going to annihilate the remnant of Israel?”.

Eze 11:14 The word of Yahweh was then addressed to me as follows,

Eze 11:15 “Son of man, to your brothers one and all, to your kinsfolk and to the whole House of Israel, the
inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, ‘Keep well away from Yahweh. This country has now been made over to
us!’.

Eze 11:16 So say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Yes, I have sent them far away among the nations and I have
dispersed them to foreign countries; and for a while I have been a sanctuary for them in the country to which
they have gone’.

Eze 11:17 So say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: I shall gather you back from the peoples, I shall collect you in
from the countries where you have been scattered and give you the land of Israel.

Eze 11:18 When they come back, they will purge it of all its horrors and loathsome practices.

Eze 11:19 I shall give them a single heart and I shall put a new spirit in them; I shall remove the heart of stone
from their bodies and give them a heart of flesh,

Eze 1 1 :20 so that they can keep my laws and respect my judgements and put them into practice. Then they will
be my people and I shall be their God.

Eze 1 1 :21 But those whose hearts are set on their horrors and loathsome practices I shall repay for their
conduct — declares the Lord Yahweh.” “

Eze 1 1 :22 The winged creatures then raised their wings and the wheels moved with them, with the glory of the
God of Israel over them, above.

Eze 1 1 :23 And the glory of Yahweh rose from the centre of the city and halted on the mountain to the east of the
city.

Eze 1 1 :24 Then the spirit lifted me up and took me, in vision, in the spirit of God, to the exiles in Chaldaea, and
the vision which I had seen faded.

Eze 1 1 :25 I then told the exiles everything that Yahweh had shown me.

Eze 12:1 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 12:2 “Son of man, you are living among a tribe of rebels who have eyes and never see, they have ears and
never hear, because they are a tribe of rebels.

Eze 12:3 So, son of man, pack an exile’s bundle and set off for exile by daylight while they watch. You will leave
your home and go somewhere else while they watch. Then perhaps they will see that they are a tribe of rebels.
Eze 12:4 You will pack your baggage like an exile’s bundle, by daylight, while they watch, and leave like an exile
in the evening, while they watch.



Eze 12:5 While they watch, make a hole in the wall, and go out through it.

Eze 12:6 While they watch, you will shoulder your pack and go out into the dark; you will cover your face so that
you cannot see the ground, since I have made you an omen for the House of Israel”.

Eze 12:7 I did as I had been told. I packed my baggage like an exile’s bundle, by daylight; and in the evening I
made a hole through the wall with my hands; then I went out into the dark and shouldered my pack while they
watched.

Eze 12:8 Next morning the word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 12:9 “Son of man, did not the House of Israel, did not that tribe of rebels, ask you, ‘What are you doing?’.
Eze 12:10 Say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: This prophecy concerns Jerusalem and the whole House of Israel
who live there’.

Eze 12:1 1 Say, ‘I am an omen for you; as I have done, so will be done to them; they will be deported into exile.
Eze 12:12 Their prince will shoulder his pack in the dark and go out through the wall; a hole will be made to let
him out; he will cover his face, so that he cannot see the country.

Eze 12:13 I shall throw my net over him and catch him in my mesh; I shall take him to Babylon, to the land of
the Chaldaeans, though he will not see it; and there he will die.

Eze 12:14 And all those in attendance on him, his army and all his troops, I shall scatter to all the winds and
unsheathe the sword behind them.

Eze 12:15 Then they will know that I am Yahweh, when I scatter them throughout the nations and disperse them
in foreign countries.

Eze 12:16 But I shall let a few of them escape the sword, famine and plague, to describe all their loathsome
practices to the peoples among whom they will go, so that these too may know that I am Yahweh’”.

Eze 12:17 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 12:18 “Son of man, you are to tremble as you eat your food and shudder apprehensively as you drink your
water,

Eze 12:19 and you are to say to the people of the country, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this to the inhabitants of
Jerusalem. They will shudder apprehensively as they eat their food, and drink their water in fear, so that the
country and its population may be freed from the violence of its inhabitants.

Eze 12:20 When the populous cities have been destroyed and the country has been reduced to desert, then you
will know that I am Yahweh’”.

Eze 12:21 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 12:22 “Son of man, what do you understand by the saying pronounced over the land of Israel, ‘Days go by
and visions fade?’

Eze 12:23 “Very well, tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: I shall put an end to this saying; it will never be
used in Israel again’. Instead, tell them: ‘The days are coming when every vision will come true,

Eze 12:24 for there will be no more futile visions or deceptive prophecy in the House of Israel,

Eze 12:25 since I, Yahweh, shall speak. And what I shall say will come true without delay; for what I shall say, I
shall perform in your own lifetime, you tribe of rebels — declares the Lord Yahweh’”.

Eze 12:26 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 12:27 “Son of man, the House of Israel is now saying, ‘The vision that this man sees concerns the distant
future; he is prophesying for times far ahead’.

Eze 12:28 Very well, tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: There will be no further delay in the fulfilling of any
of my words. What I have said shall be done now — declares the Lord Yahweh’”.

Eze 13:1 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 1 3:2 “Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel; prophesy, and say to those who make up
prophecies out of their own heads, ‘Hear what Yahweh says:

Eze 13:3 The Lord Yahweh says this: Disaster is in store for the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit and
have seen nothing!

Eze 13:4 Your prophets, Israel, are like ruin-haunting jackals!

Eze 13:5 ‘You have not ventured into the breach; you have not built up the wall round the House of Israel, to
hold fast in battle on the Day of Yahweh.

Eze 13:6 Theirs are futile visions and false predictions, who say: A prophecy from Yahweh, when Yahweh has
not sent them; yet they expect their words to come true.

Eze 13:7 Have not the visions you see been futile, have not the predictions you make been false, although you
say: A prophecy of Yahweh, when I have not spoken?

Eze 13:8 ‘Very well, the Lord Yahweh says this: Because of your futile words and false predictions, I am now
against you — declares Lord Yahweh.

Eze 13:9 My hand will be against the prophets who have futile visions and give false predictions; they will not be
admitted to the council of my people, their names will not be entered in the roll of the House of Israel, they will
not set foot on the soil of Israel; and they will know that I am the Lord Yahweh.



Eze 13:10 This is because they have misled my people by saying Peace! when there is no peace. When my
people were repairing a wall, these men came and plastered it over!

Eze 13:1 1 Tell these plasterers: It will rain hard, it will hail, it will blow a gale,

Eze 13:12 and down will come the wall! Will not people ask you: What has become of the plaster you slapped
on it?

Eze 13:13 Well then, the Lord Yahweh says this: I am going to unleash a stormy wind in my fury, torrential rain
in my anger, hailstones in my destructive fury,

Eze 13:14 and I shall shatter the wall you plastered and knock it down and lay its foundations bare. It will fall
and you will perish under it; then you will know that I am Yahweh’.

Eze 13:15 “When I have sated my anger on the wall and those who plastered it, I shall say to you, ‘The wall is
gone, and so are those who plastered over it,

Eze 13:16 the prophets of Israel who prophesy about Jerusalem and have visions of peace for her when there is
no peace — declares the Lord Yahweh’.

Eze 13:17 “Also, son of man, turn to the women of your people who make up prophecies out of their own heads;
prophesy against them.

Eze 13:18 Say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Disaster is in store for women who sew ribbons round each wrist
and make head-cloths for people of all sizes, in their hunt for souls! Are you to hunt the souls of my people and
keep your own souls safe?

Eze 13:19 You dishonour me in front of my people for a few handfuls of barley, a few bits of bread, killing those
who ought not to die and sparing those who ought not to live, lying to my people who love listening to lies.

Eze 1 3:20 ‘Very well, the Lord Yahweh says this: Look, I am now against your ribbons, with which you hunt
souls like birds, and I shall tear them off your arms and free those souls whom you hunt like birds.

Eze 1 3:21 I shall tear your head-cloths to pieces and rescue my people from your clutches; no longer will they
be fair game for you to ensnare. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.

Eze 13:22 ‘For having intimidated with lies the heart of the upright whom I had done nothing to alarm, and for
having encouraged the wicked not to give up wicked ways and so be saved,

Eze 13:23 very well, you will have no more futile visions and make no more predictions, for I shall rescue my
people from your clutches, and you will know that I am Yahweh’”.

Eze 14:1 Next, some elders of Israel visited me and while they were sitting with me,

Eze 14:2 the word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 14:3 “Son of man, these men have enshrined their foul idols in their hearts and placed the cause of their
sinning right before their eyes. Why should I let myself be consulted by them?

Eze 14:4 So speak to them; tell them this, ‘Lord Yahweh says this: Every member of the House of Israel who
enshrines his foul idols in his heart and places the cause of his sinning right before his eyes, and who then
approaches the prophet, will get this answer from me, Yahweh, as the multiplicity of his idols deserves,

Eze 14:5 and in this way I hope to win back the hearts of the House of Israel who have all been estranged from
me by their foul idols’.

Eze 14:6 “So say to the House of Israel, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Come back, turn away from your foul
idols, turn your backs on all your loathsome practices;

Eze 14:7 for if any member of the House of Israel — or any foreigner living in Israel — deserts me to enshrine his
foul idols in his heart and places the cause of his sinning right before his eyes and then approaches a prophet to
consult me through him, he will get his answer from me, Yahweh.

Eze 14:8 I shall set my face against that person; I shall make him an example and a byword; I shall rid my
people of him, and you will know that I am Yahweh.

Eze 14:9 And if the prophet is seduced into saying something, I, Yahweh, shall have seduced that prophet; I
shall point my finger at him and rid my people Israel of him.

Eze 14:10 Both will be punished for their guilt; the prophet’s punishment will be the same as that of the person
who consults him,

Eze 14:1 1 so that the House of Israel will never stray from me again or defile themselves again with these
crimes, but be my people and I their God — declares the Lord Yahweh’”.

Eze 14:12 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me:

Eze 14:13 “Son of man, when a country sins against me by being unfaithful and I point my finger at it and
destroy its supply of food, inflicting famine on it and denuding it of human and animal,

Eze 14:14 even if the three men, Noah, Danel and Job, were living in it, they would save no one but themselves
by their uprightness — declares the Lord Yahweh.

Eze 14:15 Were I to unleash wild beasts on that country to rob it of its children and reduce it to a desert which
no one would dare to cross because of the animals,

Eze 14:16 even if these three men were living there, as I live — declares the Lord Yahweh — they would not be
able to save either son or daughter; they alone would be saved, and the country would become a desert.



Eze 14:17 Were I to bring the sword down on that country and say, ‘Sword, cross the country!’. so as to denude
it of human and animal,

Eze 14:18 even if these three men were living there, as I live — declares the Lord Yahweh — they would not be
able to save either son or daughter; they alone would be saved.

Eze 14:19 If I were to send the plague on that country and vent my fury on it by bloodshed, so as to denude it of
human and animal,

Eze 14:20 even if Noah and Danel and Job were living there, as I live — declares the Lord Yahweh — they would
be able to save neither son nor daughter, only themselves by their uprightness.

Eze 14:21 “The Lord Yahweh says this, ‘Even if I send my four dreadful scourges on Jerusalem-sword, famine,
wild beasts and plague — to denude it of human and animal,

Eze 14:22 even so, there will be a remnant left, a few men and women who come through; when they come to
you and you see their conduct and actions, you will take comfort in spite of the disaster which I have brought on
Jerusalem, in spite of all I have brought on her.

Eze 14:23 They will comfort you, when you see their conduct and actions, and so you will know that I have not
done in vain all I have done to her — declares the Lord Yahweh’”.

Eze 15:1 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows:

Eze 1 5:2 Son of man, how is the wood of the vine better than wood from the branch of a forest tree?

Eze 15:3 Is its wood used for making anything? Are pegs on which to hang things made from it?

Eze 15:4 There it is, thrown on the fire for fuel. The fire burns off both ends; the middle is charred; can it be kept
for anything now?

Eze 15:5 While it was intact, you could make nothing with it; burned and charred, is it any more useful now?

Eze 15:6 So, the Lord Yahweh says this: As the wood of the vine among the forest trees, which I have thrown
on the fire for fuel, so shall I treat the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

Eze 1 5:7 I shall set my face against them. They have escaped one fire, but fire will devour them yet. And you
will know that I am Yahweh, when I set my face against them.

Eze 15:8 I shall reduce the country to a desert, because of their infidelity- declares the Lord Yahweh.

Eze 16:1 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 16:2 “Son of man, confront Jerusalem with her loathsome practices!

Eze 16:3 Say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: By origin and birth you belong to the land of Canaan. Your father
was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite.

Eze 16:4 At birth, the very day you were born, there was no one to cut your navel-string, or wash you in water to
clean you, or rub you with salt, or wrap you in swaddling clothes.

Eze 16:5 No one looked at you with pity enough to do any of these things out of sympathy for you. You were
exposed in the open fields in your own dirt on the day you were born.

Eze 16:6 ‘I saw you kicking on the ground in your blood as I was passing, and I said to you as you lay in your
blood: Live!

Eze 16:7 and I made you grow like the grass of the fields. You developed, you grew, you reached marriageable
age. Your breasts became firm and your hair grew richly, but you were stark naked.

Eze 16:8 Then I saw you as I was passing. Your time had come, the time for love. I spread my cloak over you
and covered your nakedness; I gave you my oath, I made a covenant with you — declares the Lord Yahweh —
and you became mine.

Eze 16:9 I bathed you in water, I washed the blood off you, I anointed you with oil.

Eze 16:10 I gave you embroidered dresses, fine leather shoes, a linen headband and a cloak of silk.

Eze 16:1 1 I loaded you with jewels, gave you bracelets for your wrists and a necklace for your throat.

Eze 16:12 I gave you nose-ring and earrings; I put a beautiful diadem on your head.

Eze 16:13 You were loaded with gold and silver and dressed in linen and silk and brocade. Your food was the
finest flour, honey and oil. You grew more and more beautiful; and you rose to be queen.

Eze 16:14 The fame of your beauty spread through the nations, since it was perfect, because I had clothed you
with my own splendour — declares the Lord Yahweh.

Eze 16:15 ‘But you became infatuated with your own beauty and used your fame to play the whore, lavishing
your debauchery on all comers.

Eze 16:16 You took some of your clothes to make for yourself high places bright with colours and there you
played the whore.

Eze 16:17 You also took your jewellery, made with my gold and silver which I had given you, and made yourself
male images to serve your whorings.

Eze 16:18 You took your embroidered clothes and used these to dress them up, and you offered them my oil
and my incense.

Eze 16:19 And the bread I gave you, the finest flour, the oil and honey with which I fed you, you offered them as
a pleasing smell. ‘What is more — declares the Lord Yahweh-



Eze 16:20 you took the sons and daughters you had borne me and sacrificed them as food to the images. Was
not your whoring enough in itself,

Eze 16:21 for you to slaughter my children and hand them over to be burnt in their honour?

Eze 16:22 And in all your loathsome practices and your whorings you never called your early days to mind,
when you were stark naked, kicking on the ground in your own blood.

Eze 16:23 ‘To crown your wickedness — disaster upon you, disaster! declares the Lord Yahweh-
Eze 16:24 you built yourself a mound and made yourself a high place in every open space.

Eze 16:25 At the entry to every alley you made yourself a high place, defiling your beauty and opening your legs
to all comers in countless acts of fornication.

Eze 16:26 You have also fornicated with your big-membered neighbours, the Egyptians, provoking my anger
with further acts of fornication.

Eze 16:27 So now I have raised my hand against you, I have cut down on your food, I have put you at the
mercy of your enemies, the Philistine women, who blush at your lewd behaviour.

Eze 16:28 Still unsatisfied, you prostituted yourself to the Assyrians; you played the whore with them, but were
not satisfied even then.

Eze 16:29 You committed further acts of fornication in the country of merchants, with the Chaldaeans, and
these did not satisfy you either.

Eze 16:30 ‘How simple-minded you arel-declares the Lord Yahweh — for although you do all the things that a
professional prostitute would,

Eze 16:31 in building a mound and making yourself a high place in every street, you do not act like a proper
prostitute because you disdain to take a fee.

Eze 16:32 An adulteress welcomes strangers instead of her husband.

Eze 16:33 All prostitutes accept presents, but you give presents to all your lovers, you bribe them to come from
all over the place to fornicate with you!

Eze 16:34 In fornicating, you are the opposite of other women, since no one runs after you to fornicate with you;
since you give the fee and do not get one, you are the very opposite!

Eze 16:35 ‘Very well, whore, hear the word of Yahweh!

Eze 16:36 The Lord Yahweh says this: For having squandered your money and let yourself be seen naked
while whoring with your lovers and all the foul idols of your loathsome practices and for giving them your
children’s blood-

Eze 16:37 for all this, I shall assemble all the lovers to whom you have given pleasure, all the ones you liked
and also all the ones you disliked; yes, I shall assemble them round you and strip you naked in front of them,
and let them see you naked from head to foot.

Eze 16:38 I shall pass on you the sentence that adulteresses and murderesses receive; I shall hand you over to
their jealous fury;

Eze 16:39 I shall hand you over to them; they will destroy your mound and pull down your high place; they will
tear off your clothes, take away your jewels and leave you stark naked.

Eze 16:40 Then they will call an assembly of citizens to deal with you, who will stone you to death and hack you
to pieces with their swords,

Eze 16:41 and burn down your premises and execute justice on you, while many other women look on; and I
shall put an end to your whoring: no more paid lovers for you!

Eze 16:42 Once my fury is exhausted with you, then my jealousy will leave you; I shall be calm and not angry
any more.

Eze 16:43 Since you never called to mind your early days and have done nothing but provoke me, now I in my
turn shall bring your conduct down on your own head — declares the Lord Yahweh! ‘Have you not added this
lewd behaviour to your other loathsome practices?

Eze 16:44 So now all dealers in proverbs will apply this one to you: Like mother, like daughter.

Eze 16:45 Yes; you are a true daughter of your mother, who hated her husband and her children; you are a true
sister of your sisters, who hated their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an
Amorite.

Eze 16:46 Your elder sister is Samaria, who lives to the north of you with her daughters. Your younger sister is
Sodom, who lives to the south of you with her daughters.

Eze 16:47 You never failed to imitate their behaviour and copy their loathsome practices, and soon your
behaviour was more corrupt than theirs was.

Eze 16:48 As I live - declares the Lord Yahweh — your sister Sodom and her daughters never did what you and
your daughters have done.

Eze 16:49 The crime of your sister Sodom was pride, gluttony, calm complacency; such were hers and her
daughters’ crimes. They never helped the poor and needy;

Eze 16:50 they were proud, and engaged in loathsome practices before me, and so I swept them away as you



have seen.

Eze 16:51 And yet Samaria never committed half the crimes that you have. ‘You have done more loathsome
things than they have. By all your loathsome practices you have made your sisters seem innocent,

Eze 1 6:52 and now you bear the shame of which you have freed your sisters; since the sins which you have
committed are more revolting than theirs, they are more upright than you are. So now, bear the disgrace and
shame of having put your sisters in the right.

Eze 16:53 ‘I shall restore their fortunes, I shall restore Sodom and her daughters, I shall re- store Samaria and
her daughters, and then I shall restore your fortune with theirs,

Eze 16:54 so that you can bear your shame and disgrace for all you have done, and so console them.

Eze 16:55 When your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, are restored to what they were, and Samaria and her
daughters are restored to what they were, then you too and your daughters will be restored to what you were.
Eze 16:56 Did you not gloat over your sister Sodom when you were so proud,

Eze 16:57 before you were stripped naked? Like her, you are now the laughing-stock of the women of Edom, of
all the women round, of the women of Philistia, who pour out their contempt on you.

Eze 16:58 You have brought this on yourself, with your lewdness and your loathsome practices — declares the
Lord Yahweh.

Eze 16:59 ‘For the Lord Yahweh says this: I shall treat you as you have deserved for making light of an oath
and breaking a covenant,

Eze 16:60 but I shall remember my covenant with you when you were a girl and shall conclude a covenant with
you that will last for ever.

Eze 16:61 And you for your part will remember your behaviour and feel ashamed of it when you receive your
elder and younger sisters and I make them your daughters, although this is not included in my covenant with
you.

Eze 16:62 I shall renew my covenant with you; and you will know that I am Yahweh,

Eze 16:63 and so remember and feel ashamed and in your confusion be reduced to silence, when I forgive you
for everything you have done — declares the Lord Yahweh’”.

Eze 17:1 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 17:2 “Son of man, put a riddle, propound a parable to the House of Israel.

Eze 17:3 Say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: A great eagle with great wings, long-pinioned, rich with many-
coloured plumage, came to the Lebanon.

Eze 17:4 He took the top of the cedar tree, he plucked off the top branch, he carried it off to the country of
merchants and set it down in a city of shopkeepers.

Eze 17:5 Next, he took one of the country’s seeds and put it in a fertile field; by the side of a generous stream,
like a willow tree, he placed it.

Eze 17:6 It grew and became a fruitful vine of modest size, grew up towards the eagle, its roots grew
downwards. So it became a vine, branching out and sprouting new shoots.

Eze 17:7 But there was another great eagle with great wings and thick plumage. And now the vine twisted its
roots towards him and stretched its branches towards him, for him to water it away from the bed where it was
planted.

Eze 17:8 It was in a fertile field, by the side of a wide stream that the vine had been planted, to branch out and
bear fruit and become a noble vine’.

Eze 17:9 Say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Will it succeed? Will the eagle not tear out its roots and strip off its
fruit, so that all the new leaves it puts out will wither, and no great strength is needed nor many people to pull it
up by the roots?

Eze 17:10 Planted it may be — will it succeed? Will it not shrivel up when the east wind blows? It will wither in
the bed where it was growing!’”.

Eze 17:11 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows:

Eze 17:12 “Say to that tribe of rebels, ‘Do you not know what this means?’. Say this, “Look, the king of Babylon
came to Jerusalem; he carried away the king and the princes, and took them to his home in Babylon.

Eze 17:13 He took a member of the royal family and made a treaty with him, forcing him to swear loyalty, having
already deported the leading men of the country,

Eze 17:14 so that the kingdom would remain modest and without ambitions, and would keep and honour his
treaty.

Eze 17:15 But the prince rebelled against him and sent envoys to Egypt to procure himself horses and a large
number of troops. Will he succeed? Will a man who has done this go unpunished? Can he break a treaty and go
unpunished?

Eze 17:16 As I live, I swear it - declares the Lord Yahweh — in Babylon, in the country of the king who put him
on the throne, whose oath he has disregarded and whose treaty he has broken, there he will die.

Eze 17:17 Despite the pharaoh’s great army and hordes of men, he will not be able to save him by fighting,



however many earthworks are raised, however many trenches dug to the loss of many lives.

Eze 17:18 He has disregarded the oath by breaking the treaty to which he had pledged himself and, having
done all this, will not go unpunished.

Eze 17:19 ‘So, the Lord Yahweh says this: As I live, I swear it: my oath which he has disregarded, my treaty
which he has broken, I shall make them both recoil on his own head.

Eze 17:20 I shall throw my net over him, he will be caught in my mesh; I shall take him to Babylon and punish
him there for being unfaithful to me.

Eze 17:21 All the pick of all his troops will fall by the sword, and the survivors be scattered to all the winds. And
you will know that I, Yahweh, have spoken.

Eze 17:22 ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: From the top of the tall cedar tree, from the highest branch I shall take a
shoot and plant it myself on a high and lofty mountain.

Eze 17:23 I shall plant it on the highest mountain in Israel. It will put out branches and bear fruit and grow into a
noble cedar tree. Every kind of bird will live beneath it, every kind of winged creature will rest in the shade of its
branches.

Eze 17:24 And all the trees of the countryside will know that I, Yahweh, am the one who lays the tall tree low
and raises the low tree high, who makes the green tree wither and makes the withered bear fruit. I, Yahweh,
have spoken, and I will do it’”.

Eze 18:1 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 18:2 “Why do you keep repeating this proverb in the land of Israel: The parents have eaten unripe grapes;
and the children’s teeth are set on edge?

Eze 18:3 “As I live — declares the Lord Yahweh — you will have no further cause to repeat this proverb in Israel.
Eze 18:4 Look, all life belongs to me; the father’s life and the son’s life, both alike belong to me. The one who
has sinned is the one to die.

Eze 18:5 “But if a man is upright, his actions law-abiding and upright,

Eze 18:6 and he does not eat on the mountains or raise his eyes to the foul idols of the House of Israel, does
not defile his neighbour’s wife or touch a woman during her periods,

Eze 18:7 oppresses no one, returns the pledge on a debt, does not rob, gives his own food to the hungry, his
clothes to those who lack clothing,

Eze 18:8 does not lend for profit, does not charge interest, abstains from evil, gives honest judgement between
one person and another,

Eze 18:9 keeps my laws and sincerely respects my judgements — someöne like this is truly upright and will live
— declares the Lord Yahweh.

Eze 18:10 “But if he has a son prone to violence and bloodshed, who commits one of these misdeeds-
Eze 18:11 even though the father never has — a son who dares to eat on the mountains, who defiles his
neighbour’s wife,

Eze 18:12 who oppresses the poor and needy, robs, fails to return pledges, raises his eyes to foul idols,
engages in loathsome practices,

Eze 18:13 lends for profit, or charges interest, such a person will by no means live; having committed all these
appalling crimes he will die, and his blood be on his own head.

Eze 18:14 “But if he in turn has a son who, in spite of seeing all the sins that his father has committed, does not
imitate him,

Eze 18:15 does not eat on the mountains or raise his eyes to the foul idols of the House of Israel, does not
defile his neighbour’s wife,

Eze 18:16 oppresses no one, takes no pledges, does not rob, gives his own food to the hungry, his clothes to
those who lack clothing,

Eze 18:17 abstains from evil, does not lend for profit or charge interest, respects my judgements and keeps my
laws, he will not die for his father’s sins: he will most certainly live.

Eze 18:18 But his father, because he was violent, robbed others and never did good among his people, will
most certainly die in his guilt.

Eze 18:19 “Now, you say, ‘Why doesn’t the son bear his father’s guilt?’. If the son has been law-abiding and
upright, has kept all my laws and followed them, most certainly he will live.

Eze 1 8:20 The one who has sinned is the one who must die; a son is not to bear his father’s guilt, nor a father
his son’s guilt. The upright will be credited with his uprightness, and the wicked with his wickedness.

Eze 18:21 “If the wicked, however, renounces all the sins he has committed, respects my laws and is law-
abiding and upright, he will most certainly live; he will not die.

Eze 1 8:22 None of the crimes he committed will be remembered against him from then on; he will most certainly
live because of his upright actions.

Eze 18:23 Would I take pleasure in the death of the wicked — declares the Lord Yahweh - and not prefer to see
him renounce his wickedness and live?



Eze 18:24 “But if the upright abandons uprightness and does wrong by copying all the loathsome practices of
the wicked, is he to live? All his upright actions will be forgotten from then on; for the infidelity of which he is
guilty and the sin which he has committed, he will most certainly die.

Eze 1 8:25 “Now, you say, ‘What the Lord does is unjust’. Now listen, House of Israel: is what I do unjust? Is it
not what you do that is unjust?

Eze 18:26 When the upright abandons uprightness and does wrong and dies, he dies because of the wrong
which he himself has done.

Eze 18:27 Similarly, when the wicked abandons wickedness to become law-abiding and upright, he saves his
own life.

Eze 18:28 Having chosen to renounce all his previous crimes, he will most certainly live: he will not die.

Eze 18:29 And yet the House of Israel says, ‘What the Lord does is unjust’. Is what I do unjust, House of Israel?
Is it not what you do that is unjust?

Eze 18:30 So in future, House of Israel, I shall judge each of you by what that person does — declares the Lord
Yahweh. Repent, renounce all your crimes, avoid all occasions for guilt.

Eze 1 8:31 Shake off all the crimes you have committed, and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit!

Why die, House of Israel?

Eze 1 8:32 I take no pleasure in the death of anyone — declares the Lord Yahweh — so repent and live!”.

Eze 19:1 “Now, raise a lament for the princes of Israel.

Eze 19:2 Say: What was your mother? A lioness among lions; lying among the cubs she nursed her whelps.

Eze 1 9:3 She reared one of her whelps: he grew into a young lion; he learnt to tear his prey; he became a man-
eater.

Eze 19:4 The nations came to hear of him; he was caught in their pit; they dragged him away with hooks to
Egypt.

Eze 1 9:5 Her expectation thwarted, and seeing her hope dashed, she took another of her whelps and made a
young lion of him.

Eze 19:6 He prowled among the lions, he grew into a young lion, he learnt to tear his prey; he became a man-
eater.

Eze 19:7 He tore down their palaces, he destroyed their cities; the land and all its inhabitants were appalled by
the sound of his roars.

Eze 19:8 The nations marched out against him from the surrounding provinces; they spread their net over him;
he was caught in their pit.

Eze 19:9 They shackled him with hooks, they took him to the king of Babylon and threw him into a fortress, so
that his voice could never again be heard on the mountains of Israel.

Eze 19:10 Your mother was like a vine planted beside the water, fruitful and leafy, because the water flowed so
full.

Eze 19:1 1 She had stout stems which became kingly sceptres; she grew higher and higher, up into the clouds;
she was admired for her height and the number of her branches.

Eze 19:12 But she was furiously uprooted and thrown on the ground; the east wind dried up her fruit, she was
broken to pieces; her stout stem dried up, the fire devoured it.

Eze 19:13 Now she has been transplanted to the desert, to a dry and thirsty land.

Eze 19:14 Fire burst out of her stem devouring her branches and fruit. No more stout stem for her, no more
kingly sceptre”. This is a lament; it was used as such.

Eze 20:1 In the seventh year, on the tenth day of the fifth month, some of the elders of Israel came to consult
Yahweh and were sitting with me,

Eze 20:2 when the word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 20:3 “Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel. Say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Have you come to
consult me? As I live, I will not be consulted by you — declares the Lord Yahweh’.

Eze 20:4 “Are you ready to judge them? Are you ready to judge them, son of man? Confront them with the
loathsome practices of their ancestors.

Eze 20:5 Say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: On the day when I chose Israel, when I pledged my word to the
House of Jacob, I made myself known to them in Egypt; I pledged my word to them and said: I am Yahweh your
God.

Eze 20:6 That day I pledged them my word that I would bring them out of Egypt to a country which I had
reconnoitred for them, a country flowing with milk and honey, and the loveliest of them all.

Eze 20:7 And I said to them: Each of you must reject the horrors which attract you; do not pollute yourselves
with the foul idols of Egypt; I am Yahweh your God.

Eze 20:8 But they rebelled against me and would not listen to me. Not one of them rejected the horrors which
attracted them; they did not give up the foul idols of Egypt. I then resolved to vent my fury on them, to sate my
anger on them in Egypt.



Eze 20:9 But respect for my own name kept me from letting it be profaned in the eyes of the nations among
whom they were living, and before whom I had made myself known to them and promised to bring them out of
Egypt.

Eze 20:10 So I brought them out of Egypt and led them into the desert.

Eze 20:1 1 I gave them my laws and taught them my judgements, in whose observance people find life.

Eze 20:12 And I also gave them my Sabbaths as a sign between me and them, so that they might know that I,
Yahweh, am the one who sanctifies them.

Eze 20:13 The House of Israel, however, rebelled against me in the desert; they refused to keep my laws, they
scorned my judgements, in whose observance people find life, and they grossly profaned my Sabbaths. I then
resolved to vent my fury on them in the desert and destroy them.

Eze 20:14 But respect for my own name kept me from letting it be profaned in the eyes of the nations, before
whom I had brought them out.

Eze 20:15 Even so, I pledged them my word in the desert that I would not lead them to the country which I had
given them, a country flowing with milk and honey, and the loveliest of them all,

Eze 20:16 since they had scorned my judgements, had refused to keep my laws and had profaned my
Sabbaths, their hearts being attached to foul idols.

Eze 20:17 In spite of this, I took pity on them; I refrained from destroying them and did not make an end of them
in the desert.

Eze 20:18 ‘I said to their children in the desert: Do not follow the laws of your ancestors, do not practise their
judgements, do not defile yourselves with their foul idols.

Eze 20:19 I am Yahweh your God. Keep my laws, respect my judgements and practise them.

Eze 20:20 Keep my Sabbaths holy; let them be a sign between me and you, so that people may know that I am
Yahweh your God.

Eze 20:21 Their children, however, rebelled against me; they refused to keep my laws, they did not respect or
practise my judgements, which must be practised by all who want to live; they profaned my Sabbaths. I then
resolved to vent my fury on them, to sate my anger on them in the desert.

Eze 20:22 But I restrained my hand; respect for my own name kept me from letting it be profaned in the eyes of
the nations, before whom I had brought them out.

Eze 20:23 Once again, however, I pledged them my word that I would scatter them throughout the nations and
disperse them in foreign countries,

Eze 20:24 because they had not followed my judgements but had rejected my laws and profaned my Sabbaths,
their eyes being fastened on the foul idols of their ancestors.

Eze 20:25 And for this reason I gave them laws that were not good and judgements by which they could never
live;

Eze 20:26 and I polluted them with their own offerings, making them sacrifice every first-born son in order to fill
them with revulsion, so that they would know that I am Yahweh’.

Eze 20:27 “For this reason, son of man, speak to the House of Israel. Say to them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this:
Here is another way by which your ancestors outraged me by their infidelity.

Eze 20:28 Once I had brought them into the country which I had pledged my word to give them, they then saw
all sorts of high hills, all kinds of leafy trees, and there they performed their sacrifices and made offerings that
provoked my anger; there they set out their pleasing smell and poured their libations.

Eze 20:29 I then said to them: What is this high place where you go? And they gave, and still give it, the name
of Bamah’.

Eze 20:30 “So, say to the House of Israel, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: If you are polluting yourselves as your
ancestors did by fornicating with their horrors-

Eze 20:31 for by offering your gifts and by burning your children as sacrifices, you have been polluting
yourselves with all your foul idols to this very day — shall I let myself be consulted by you, House of Israel? As I
live — declares Lord Yahweh — 1 shall not let myself be consulted by you.

Eze 20:32 And what you sometimes imagine will never be so, when you say: We shall be like the peoples, the
tribes of foreign lands, worshipping wood and stone.

Eze 20:33 As I live I swear it — declares the Lord Yahweh — I am the one who will reign over you, with a strong
hand and outstretched arm, once my fury is sated.

Eze 20:34 With a strong hand and outstretched arm, once my fury is sated, I shall bring you back from the
peoples and gather you again from the countries throughout which you have been scattered.

Eze 20:35 I shall lead you into the desert of the nations and there I shall judge you face to face.

Eze 20:36 As I judged your ancestors in the desert of Egypt, so will I judge you — declares the Lord Yahweh.
Eze 20:37 I shall make you pass under the crook, bring you to respect the covenant

Eze 20:38 and rid you of the rebels who have revolted against me; I shall bring them out of the country where
they are staying, but they will not enter the country of Israel, and you will know that I am Yahweh.



Eze 20:39 House of Israel, Lord Yahweh says this: Go on, all of you, worship your foul idols, but later we shall
see if you don’t listen to me! Then you will stop profaning my holy name with your offerings and your foul idols.
Eze 20:40 For on my holy mountain, on the high mountain of Israel — declares the Lord Yahweh — is where the
whole House of Israel, everyone in the country, will worship me. There I shall accept and there expect your
presents, your choicest offering and all your consecrated gifts.

Eze 20:41 I shall welcome you like a pleasing smell when I bring you back from the peoples and gather you
from the countries throughout which you have been scattered, and through you I shall display my holiness for all
the nations to see;

Eze 20:42 and you will know that I am Yahweh, when I bring you back to the soil of Israel, to the country which I
pledged my word to give to your ancestors.

Eze 20:43 There you will remember your past behaviour and all the actions by which you have defiled
yourselves, and you will loathe yourselves for all the wrongs which you have committed.

Eze 20:44 And you will know that I am Yahweh, when I treat you as respect for my own name requires, and not
as your wicked behaviour and corrupt actions deserve, House of Israel — declares the Lord Yahweh’”.

Eze 21:1 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 21 :2 “Son of man, turn to the right; utter your word towards the south, prophesy against the forest land of
the Negeb.

Eze 21 :3 Say to the forest of Negeb, ‘Hear the word of Yahweh! The Lord Yahweh says this: Listen; I am about
to kindle a fire in you which will burn up every green tree in you as well as every dry one; it will be an
unquenchable blaze and every face will be scorched by it from the Negeb to the north.

Eze 21 :4 All humanity will see that it was I, Yahweh, who kindled it, and it will not be extinguished’”.

Eze 21 :5 I said, “Lord Yahweh, they say of me, ‘He does nothing but speak in riddles!’”.

Eze 21 :6 Then the word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 21 :7 “Son of man, turn towards Jerusalem, utter your word towards the sanctuary and prophesy against the
land of Israel.

Eze 21 :8 Say to the land of Israel, ‘Yahweh says this: Now I am against you; I am about to unsheathe my sword
and rid you of the upright and the wicked alike.

Eze 21 :9 Since I am going to rid you of upright and wicked alike, I shall unsheathe my sword against everyone
alive, from the Negeb to the north,

Eze 21:10 so that everyone alive will know that I, Yahweh, am the one who has unsheathed my sword; it will not
go back again’.

Eze 21:11 “Son of man, groan as though your heart were breaking. Litter your bitter groans where they can see
you.

Eze 21:12 And if they say, ‘Why these groans?’. reply, ‘Because of the news which is about to come, all hearts
will sink, all hands grow weak, all spirits grow faint and all knees turn to water. It is coming now, it is here!-
declares Lord Yahweh’”.

Eze 21:13 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 21:14 “Son of man, prophesy. Say, ‘The Lord says this. Say: The sword, the sword has been sharpened
and polished,

Eze 21:15 sharpened for slaughter, polished to flash like lightning …

Eze 21:16 He has had it polished to be wielded, this sword sharpened and polished to put in the slaughterer’s
hand!

Eze 21:17 Shout and wail, son of man, for it will come on my people, on all the chief men of Israel doomed like
my people to the sword! So beat your breast,

Eze 21:18 for this will be an ordeal … declares the Lord Yahweh.

Eze 21:19 So prophesy, son of man, and clap your hands! Let the sword pass three times, that sword for
victims, that sword for a great victim, threatening them from every side!

Eze 21:20 To make hearts sink and make sure many fall, I have posted the slaughtering sword at every gate to
flash like lightning, polished for slaughter.

Eze 21 :21 Be sharp, on the right, be ready on the left, whichever way your blade is needed!

Eze 21 :22 I too shall clap my hands and sate my fury! I, Yahweh, have spoken’”.

Eze 21 :23 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 21 :24 “Son of man, mark out two roads for the sword of the king of Babylon to come along, making both of
them begin from the same country. Then put up a signpost, put it where the road leaves for the city,

Eze 21 :25 trace the route which the sword should take for Rabbah-of-the-Ammonites, and for Judah, to the
fortress of Jerusalem.

Eze 21 :26 For the king of Babylon has halted at the fork where these two roads diverge, to take the omens. He
has shaken the arrows, questioned the household gods, inspected the liver.

Eze 21 :27 The lot marked “Jerusalem” is in his right hand: there to set up battering-rams, give the word for



slaughter, raise the war cry, level battering-rams against the gates, cast up earthworks, build entrenchments.

Eze 21 :28 The inhabitants will believe that these omens are idle, for they have received sworn guarantees, but
he will bring their guilt to mind and capture them.

Eze 21 :29 And so the Lord Yahweh says this, ‘Since you have brought your guilt to mind by parading your
misdeeds and flaunting your sins in everything you do: because you have drawn attention to yourselves, you will
be captured.

Eze 21:30 As for you, impious and wicked prince of Israel, whose doom is approaching to put an end to your
crimes,

Eze 21 :31 the Lord Yahweh says this: They will take away your diadem and remove your crown. Everything will
be changed; the low will be raised and the high brought low!

Eze 21:32 Ruin, ruin, I shall bring such ruin as never was before, until the rightful ruler comes, on whom I shall
bestow it’.

Eze 21:33 “Son of man, prophesy and say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: In reply to the Ammonites and their
jeers, say: The sword, the sword is drawn for slaughter, polished to devour, to flash like lightning-
Eze 21 :34 while you have empty visions and consult lying omens-to cut the throats of the wicked, whose doom
is approaching to put an end to their crimes.

Eze 21 :35 Put it back in the scabbard. The place where you were created, the land of your origin, will be where I
judge you.

Eze 21 :36 I shall vent my fury on you, breathe the fire of my rage against you and hand you over to barbarous
men whose trade is destruction.

Eze 21:37 You will be fuel for the fire, your blood will flow through the country, you will leave no memory behind
you; for I, Yahweh, have spoken!’”.

Eze 22:1 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 22:2 “Son of man, are you ready to judge? Are you ready to judge the blood-stained city? Confront her with
all her loathsome practices!

Eze 22:3 Say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: City shedding blood inside yourself to hasten your doom, making
foul idols on your soil to defile yourself,

Eze 22:4 you have incurred guilt by the blood you have shed, you have defiled yourself with the foul idols you
have made, you have shortened your days, you have come to the end of your years. This is why I have made
you an object of scorn to the nations and a laughing-stock to every country.

Eze 22:5 From far and near they will taunt you with your infamous disorders.

Eze 22:6 ‘Look! In you the princes of Israel, one and all, have furthered their own interests at the cost of
bloodshed;

Eze 22:7 in you people have despised their fathers and mothers; in you they have ill-treated the settler; in you
they have oppressed the widow and orphan.

Eze 22:8 You have treated my sanctuary with contempt, you have profaned my Sabbaths.

Eze 22:9 In you informers incite to bloodshed; in you people eat on the mountains and act licentiously;

Eze 22:10 in you they have sexual intercourse with their fathers; in you they force themselves on women in their
periods;

Eze 22:1 1 in you one man engages in loathsome practices with his neighbour’s wife, another lewdly defiles his
daughter-in-law, another violates his sister, his own father’s daughter.

Eze 22:12 In you people take bribes for shedding blood; you lend for profit and charge interest, you profit from
your fellow by extortion and have forgotten about me — declares the Lord Yahweh.

Eze 22:13 ‘Now I shall clap my hands at your acts of banditry and the blood that flows in you.

Eze 22:14 Will your heart be able to resist, will your hands be steady, the day when I call you to account? I,
Yahweh, have spoken and shall act.

Eze 22:15 I shall scatter you among the nations and disperse you in foreign countries, and so put an end to the
filthiness now inside you;

Eze 22:16 through your own fault, you will be profaned in the eyes of the nations, and you will know that I am
Yahweh!’”.

Eze 22:17 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 22:18 “Son of man, for me, the House of Israel has become dross: copper, tin, iron, lead, all mixed up
together in the melting-pot; they are dross.

Eze 22:19 And so, Lord Yahweh says this, ‘Since you have all become dross, right! I shall collect you inside
Jerusalem.

Eze 22:20 As silver, copper, iron, lead and tin are collected in the melting-pot, and the fire is blown underneath
to melt them down, so I shall collect you in my furious anger and have you melted down;

Eze 22:21 I shall collect you and blow up the fire of my rage for you and have you melted down inside the city.
Eze 22:22 As silver is melted in the melting-pot, so you will be melted down inside the city, and you will know



that I, Yahweh, have vented my fury on you’”.

Eze 22:23 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 22:24 “Son of man, say to her, ‘You are a land that has not received rain or shower on the day of anger.
Eze 22:25 In you, the princes are like a roaring lion tearing its prey. They have eaten the people, seized wealth
and jewels and widowed many inside her.

Eze 22:26 Her priests have violated my law and desecrated my sanctuary; they have made no distinction
between sacred and profane, they have not taught people the difference between clean and unclean; they have
turned their eyes away from my Sabbaths and I have been dishonoured by them.

Eze 22:27 In her the leaders are wolves tearing their prey, shedding blood and killing people to steal their
possessions.

Eze 22:28 Her prophets have plastered these things over with their empty visions and lying prophecies, saying:
Yahweh says this, although Yahweh has not spoken.

Eze 22:29 The people of the country have taken to extortion and banditry; they have oppressed the poor and
needy and ill-treated the settler in a way that is unjustifiable.

Eze 22:30 I have been looking for someöne among them to build a barricade and oppose me in the breach, to
defend the country and prevent me from destroying it; but I have found no one.

Eze 22:31 Hence I have vented my fury on them; I have put an end to them in the fire of my rage. I have made
their conduct recoil on their own heads — declares the Lord Yahweh’”.

Eze 23:1 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 23:2 “Son of man, there were once two women, daughters of the same mother.

Eze 23:3 They played the whore in Egypt; they played the whore when they were still girls. There their nipples
were handled, there their virgin breasts were first fondled.

Eze 23:4 Their names were: Oholah the elder, Oholibah her sister. They belonged to me and bore sons and
daughters. As regards their names, Samaria is Oholah, Jerusalem Oholibah.

Eze 23:5 Now Oholah played the whore, although she belonged to me; she lusted after her lovers, her
neighbours the Assyrians,

Eze 23:6 dressed in purple, governors and magistrates, all of them young and desirable, and skilful horsemen.
Eze 23:7 She played the whore with all of them, the pick of Assyria, and defiled herself with all the foul idols of
all those with whom she was in love,

Eze 23:8 nor did she give up the whoring begun in Egypt, where men had slept with her from her girlhood,
fondling her virgin breasts, debauching her over and over again.

Eze 23:9 “That is why I have handed her over to her lovers, to the Assyrians with whom she was in love.

Eze 23:10 They stripped her naked, seized her sons and daughters and put her to the sword. She became
notorious among women for the justice done on her.

Eze 23:1 1 “Her sister Oholibah saw all this, but she was even more depraved, and her whorings were worse
than her sister’s.

Eze 23:12 She fell in love with her neighbours the Assyrians, governors and magistrates, dressed in sumptuous
clothes, skilful horsemen, all young and desirable.

Eze 23:13 Then I saw that she had defiled herself, that both sisters were equally bad.

Eze 23:14 She began whoring worse than ever; no sooner had she seen wall-carvings of men, pictures of
Chaldaeans coloured vermilion,

Eze 23:15 men with sashes round their waists and elaborate turbans on their heads, all so lordly of bearing,
depicting the Babylonians, natives of Chaldaea,

Eze 23:16 than she fell in love with them at first sight and sent messengers to them in Chaldaea.

Eze 23:17 The Babylonians came to her, shared her love-bed and defiled her with their whoring. Once defiled
by them, she withdrew her affection from them.

Eze 23:18 Thus she flaunted her whoring, exposing her body, until I withdrew my affection from her as I had
withdrawn it from her sister.

Eze 23:19 But she began whoring worse than ever, remembering her girlhood, when she had played the whore
in Egypt,

Eze 23:20 when she had been in love with their profligates, big-membered as donkeys, ejaculating as violently
as stallions.

Eze 23:21 “You were hankering for the debauchery of your girlhood, when they used to handle your nipples in
Egypt and fondle your young breasts.

Eze 23:22 And so, Oholibah, Lord Yahweh says this, ‘I shall set all your lovers against you, from whom you
have withdrawn your affection, and bring them to assault you from all directions:

Eze 23:23 the Babylonians and all the Chaldaeans, the men of Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians
with them, young and desirable, all governors and magistrates, all famous lords and skilful horsemen.

Eze 23:24 From the north, they will advance on you with chariots and wagons and an international army and



beset you with shield, buckler and helmet on all sides. I shall charge them to pass sentence on you and they will
pass sentence on you as they think fit.

Eze 23:25 I shall direct my jealousy against you; they will treat you with fury; they will cut off your nose and ears,
and what is left of your family will fall by the sword; they will seize your sons and daughters, and what is left will
be burnt.

Eze 23:26 They will strip off your garments and rob you of your jewels.

Eze 23:27 I shall put an end to your debauchery and to the whorings you began in Egypt; you will not look to the
Egyptians any more, you will never think of them again.

Eze 23:28 For the Lord Yahweh says this: Now, I shall hand you over to those you hate, to those for whom you
no longer feel affection.

Eze 23:29 They will treat you with hatred, they will rob you of the entire fruit of your labours and leave you stark
naked. And thus your shameful whorings will be exposed, your debauchery and your whorings.

Eze 23:30 This will happen to you because you have played the whore with the nations and have defiled
yourself with their foul idols.

Eze 23:31 Since you have copied your sister’s behaviour, I shall put her cup in your hand’.

Eze 23:32 The Lord Yahweh says this: You will drink your sister’s cup, a cup both deep and wide, leading to
laughter and mockery, so ample the draught it holds.

Eze 23:33 You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow. Cup of affliction and devastation, the cup of your
sister Samaria,

Eze 23:34 you will drink it, you will drain it; then you will break it in pieces and lacerate your own breasts. For I
have spoken — declared the Lord Yahweh.

Eze 23:35 ‘And so, the Lord Yahweh says this: Since you have forgotten me and have turned your back on me,
you too will have to bear the weight of your debauchery and whorings’”.

Eze 23:36 And Yahweh said to me, “Son of man, are you ready to judge Oholah and Oholibah and charge them
with their loathsome practices?

Eze 23:37 They have been adulteresses, their hands are dripping with blood, they have committed adultery with
their foul idols. As for the children they had borne me, they have offered them as burnt sacrifices to feed them.
Eze 23:38 And here is something else they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary today and have
profaned my Sabbaths.

Eze 23:39 The same day as sacrificing their children to their idols, they have been to my sanctuary and
profaned it. Yes, this is what they have done in my own house.

Eze 23:40 “Worse still, they summoned men from far away, invited by messenger, and they came. For them you
bathed, you painted your eyes, put on your jewels

Eze 23:41 and sat on a sumptuous bed, by which a table was laid out. On this you had put my incense and my
oil.

Eze 23:42 The noise of the carefree company resounded, made by the crowd of men brought in from the desert;
they put bracelets on the women’s arms and magnificent crowns on their heads.

Eze 23:43 I thought, ‘That woman, worn out with adultery! Are they going to fornicate with her too?’.

Eze 23:44 Yet they visit her like any common prostitute, just as they visited those profligate women Oholah and
Oholibah.

Eze 23:45 All the same, there are upright men who will judge them as adulteresses and murderesses are
judged, since they are adulteresses and their hands are dripping with blood’.

Eze 23:46 “The Lord Yahweh says this, ‘Summon an assembly to deal with them, and hand them over to terror
and pillage;

Eze 23:47 let the assembly stone them and dispatch them with their swords; let their sons and daughters be
slaughtered and their houses set on fire.

Eze 23:48 This is how I shall purge the country of debauchery, so that all women will be taught the lesson never
to ape your debauchery again.

Eze 23:49 Your debauchery will recoil on yourselves, and you will bear the weight of the sins committed with
your foul idols and you will know that I am the Lord Yahweh’”.

Eze 24:1 In the ninth year, on the tenth day of the tenth month, the word of Yahweh was addressed to me as
follows,

Eze 24:2 “Son of man, write down today’s date, yes, today’s, for this very day the king of Babylon began his
attack on Jerusalem.

Eze 24:3 So pronounce a parable for this tribe of rebels. Say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Put the pot on the
fire; put it on; pour the water in!

Eze 24:4 Now put the cuts of meat all in together, all the best cuts, leg and shoulder. Fill it with the best bones.
Eze 24:5 Take the best of the flock, then heap wood underneath; boil it thoroughly until even the bones are
cooked.



Eze 24:6 ‘For the Lord Yahweh says this: Disaster is in store for the bloody city, for that rusty cooking pot
whose rust will not come off! Empty it, bit by bit, not bothering to draw lots;

Eze 24:7 for she is still full of bloodshed, she has put blood on the naked rock; she did not pour it on the ground
so as to cover it with dust.

Eze 24:8 To make anger rise, to exact vengeance, I have put her blood on the naked rock, so that it should not
be covered:

Eze 24:9 ‘So, the Lord Yahweh says this: Disaster is in store for the bloody city! I too plan to build a great fire.
Eze 24:10 Heap on the wood, light it, cook the meat, prepare the seasoning let the bones burn!

Eze 24:1 1 Put the empty pot on the coals to make it hot, until the bronze glows, the filth inside melts and the
rust is burnt away!

Eze 24:12 ‘But all that rust would not come off in the fire.

Eze 24: 1 3 Your filth is infamous. Since I have tried to purge you and you would not let yourself be purged of
your filth, so now you will never be purged of your filth until I have sated my anger on you.

Eze 24:14 I, Yahweh, have spoken; this will happen; I shall act and not relent; I shall show no pity, no
compassion. You will be judged as your conduct and actions deserve — declares the Lord Yahweh’. 1
Eze 24:15 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 24: 1 6 “Son of man, at a blow I am about to deprive you of the delight of your eyes. But you are not to
lament, not to weep, not to let your tears run down.

Eze 24:17 Groan in silence, do not go into mourning for the dead, knot your turban round your head, put your
sandals on your feet, do not cover your beard, do not eat the usual food”.

Eze 24:18 I told this to the people in the morning, and my wife died in the evening, and the next morning I did as
I had been ordered.

Eze 24:19 The people then said to me, “Will you not explain what meaning these actions have for us?”.

Eze 24:20 I replied, “The word of Yahweh has been addressed to me as follows,

Eze 24:21 ‘Say to the House of Israel, the Lord Yahweh says this: I am about to profane my sanctuary, the
pride of your strength, the delight of your eyes, the joy of your hearts. Your sons and daughters whom you have
left behind will fall by the sword.

Eze 24:22 Then you will do as I have done: you will not cover your beards or eat the usual food;

Eze 24:23 you will keep your turbans on your heads and your sandals on your feet; you will not lament or weep
but will waste away for your crimes, groaning among yourselves.

Eze 24:24 Thus Ezekiel is a sign for you. You will do exactly what he has done. And when this happens, you will
know that I am Lord Yahweh!’.

Eze 24:25 “And, son of man, the day that I deprive them of their strength, their crowning joy, the delight of their
eyes, the joy of their hearts, their sons and daughters,

Eze 24:26 that day a survivor will bring you the news.

Eze 24:27 That day your mouth will be opened to speak to the survivor; you will speak and no longer be dumb;
you will be a sign for them, and they will know that I am Yahweh”.

Eze 25:1 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 25:2 “Son of man, turn towards the Ammonites and prophesy against them.

Eze 25:3 Say to the Ammonites, ‘Hear the word of the Lord Yahweh. The Lord Yahweh says this: ‘Since you
gloated over my sanctuary when it was profaned, and over the land of Israel when it was ravaged, and over the
House of Judah when it went into exile,

Eze 25:4 I shall let the sons of the East take possession of you; they will pitch their camps inside you, they will
make their home in you. They will be the ones to eat your produce and drink your milk.

Eze 25:5 I shall turn Rabbah into a camel yard and the towns of Ammon into sheepfolds. And so you will know
that I am Yahweh.

Eze 25:6 ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Since you have clapped your hands and danced for joy, full of malicious
delight at Israel’s fate,

Eze 25:7 my hand will be against you for this; I shall hand you over to be looted by the peoples, obliterate you
as a nation and wipe you out as a country. I shall reduce you to nothing, and you will know that I am Yahweh.
Eze 25:8 ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: ‘Since Moab and Seir have said: Look at the House of Judah; it is no
different from any other nation;

Eze 25:9 very well, I shall expose Moab’s heights; its cities will no longer be cities throughout the land — the
jewels of the country, Beth-Jeshimoth, Baal-Meon and Kiriathaim.

Eze 25:10 I shall let the sons of the East and the Ammonites take possession of them, so that they will no
longer be remembered by the nations.

Eze 25:1 1 I shall bring Moab to justice, and they will know that I am Yahweh.

Eze 25:12 ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: ‘Since Edom has taken revenge on the House of Judah and committed
great crimes in doing so,



Eze 25:13 very well, the Lord Yahweh says this: My hand will be against Edom and denude it of human and
animal. I shall lay it waste, from Teman as far as Dedan they will be put to the sword.

Eze 25:14 I shall take vengeance on Edom by means of my people Israel. They will treat Edom as my anger
and fury dictate, and they will know this is my vengeance — declares the Lord Yahweh.

Eze 25:15 ‘The Lord Yahweh says this, ‘Since the Philistines have acted in revenge and, motivated by malice,
have taken revenge, doing their best to destroy because of their long-standing hatred,

Eze 25:16 very well, the Lord Yahweh says this: My hand will be against the Philistines; I shall exterminate the
Cherethites and destroy the rest of the coastal peoples.

Eze 25:17 I shall perform frightful acts of vengeance and inflict furious punishments on them; and they will know
that I am Yahweh, when I exact my vengeance on them’”.

Eze 26:1 In the eleventh year, on the first of the month, the word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,
Eze 26:2 “Son of man, since Tyre has said of Jerusalem: ‘Aha! She is shattered, the Gateway to the Nations;
she now gives way to me. Her riches are ruined!’.

Eze 26:3 Very well, the Lord Yahweh says this, ‘Now, Tyre, I am against you,

Eze 26:4 I shall raise many nations against you as the sea raises its waves. They will destroy the walls of Tyre,
they will demolish her towers; I shall sweep the dust of her away and reduce her to a naked rock.

Eze 26:5 She will be a drying-ground out to sea for fishing-nets. For I have spoken- declares Lord Yahweh. She
will be the prey of the nations.

Eze 26:6 As for her daughters on the mainland, these will be put to the sword, and they will know that I am
Yahweh’.

Eze 26:7 “For the Lord Yahweh says this, ‘From the north, I shall bring Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, king
of kings, down on Tyre with horses, chariots, cavalry and an enormous army.

Eze 26:8 He will put your daughters on the mainland to the sword. He will build siege-works against you, cast up
a siege-ramp against you, raise a screen against you;

Eze 26:9 he will pound your walls with his battering-rams, and demolish your towers with his siege-engines.

Eze 26:10 His horses are so many that their dust will hide you. The noise of his horsemen and his chariot-
wheels will make your walls tremble as he enters your gates as though storming into a city through the breach.
Eze 26:1 1 With his horses’ hoofs he will trample through all your streets; he will put your people to the sword,
and throw your massive pillars to the ground.

Eze 26:12 Your wealth will be seized, your merchandise looted, your walls razed, your luxurious houses shattered, your stones, your timbers, your very dust, thrown into the sea.

Eze 26:13 I shall put an end to the sound of your songs; the sound of your harps will not be heard again.

Eze 26:14 I shall reduce you to a naked rock, and make you into a drying-ground for fishing-nets, never to be
rebuilt; for I, Yahweh, have spoken -declares the Lord Yahweh’.

Eze 26:15 “The Lord Yahweh says this to Tyre, ‘Will not the islands quake at the sound of your fall, while the
wounded groan and the slaughter takes place inside you?

Eze 26:16 All the princes of the sea will leave their thrones, lay aside their cloaks, take off their embroidered
robes. Dressed in terror they will sit on the ground trembling incessantly, stunned at your fate.

Eze 26:17 ‘They will raise the lament for you as follows: You are destroyed then, vanished from the seas,
famous city, former sea-power, who with her citizens, used to spread terror all over the mainland!

Eze 26:18 Now the islands are trembling on the day of your fall; the islands of the sea are terrified by your end.
Eze 26:19 ‘For the Lord Yahweh says this: ‘When I make you a ruined city like other deserted cities, when I
raise the deep against you and the ocean covers you,

Eze 26:20 when I fling you down with those who go down into the abyss, with the people of long ago, and put
you deep in the underworld, in the ruins of long ago with those who sink into oblivion, so that you can never
come back or be restored to the land of the living,

Eze 26:21 I will make you an object of terror; you will not exist. People will look for you but never find you again
— declares the Lord Yahweh!’”.

Eze 27:1 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 27:2 “Son of man, raise the lament for Tyre.

Eze 27:3 Say to Tyre, ‘City enthroned at the gateway of the sea, agent between the peoples and the many
islands, Lord Yahweh says this: Tyre, you used to say: I am a ship perfect in beauty.

Eze 27:4 Your frontiers were far out to sea; those who built you made you perfect in beauty.

Eze 27:5 Cypress from Senir they used for all your planking. They took a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast
above you.

Eze 27:6 From oaks of Bashan they made your oars. They built you a deck of cedar inlaid with ivory from the
Kittim isles.

Eze 27:7 Embroidered linen from Egypt was used for your sail and for your flag. Purple and scarlet from the
Elishah islands formed your deck-tent.



Eze 27:8 The people of Sidon and Arvad were your oarsmen. The sages of Tyre were aboard, serving as
sailors.

Eze 27:9 The elders and craftsmen of Gebal were there to caulk your seams. ‘Every sea-going ship and crew
frequented you to guarantee your trade.

Eze 27:10 Men from Persia, Lud and Put served as warriors in your army; hanging up shield and helmet in you,
they displayed your splendour.

Eze 27:1 1 The sons of Arvad with their army manned your walls all round, while the Gammadians manned your
towers; hanging their shields all round your walls, they completed your beauty.

Eze 27:12 Tarshish traded with you because of your abundant resources and exchanged your merchandise for
silver, iron, tin and lead.

Eze 27:13 Javan, Tubal and Meshech traded with you. For your merchandise they traded slaves and bronze
artefacts.

Eze 27:14 The people of Beth-Togarmah traded your horses, chargers, mules.

Eze 27:15 The people of Dedan traded with you; many islands were your customers and paid you in ivory tusks
and ebony.

Eze 27:16 Edom traded with you for the sake of your many manufactured goods, exchanging garnets, purple,
embroideries, fine linen, coral and rubies for your goods.

Eze 27:17 Judah and the land of Israel also traded with you, bringing corn from Minnith, pannag, honey, oil and
balm.

Eze 27:18 Damascus traded with you, for quantities of your manufactured goods and other goods of all kinds,
furnishing you with wine from Helbon and wool from Zahar.

Eze 27:19 Dan and Javan, from Uzal onwards, supplied you with wrought iron, cassia and reeds in exchange
for your goods.

Eze 27:20 Dedan traded with you in saddle-cloths.

Eze 27:21 Arabia and all the sheikhs of Kedar were your customers; they paid in lambs, rams and he-goats.

Eze 27:22 The merchants of Sheba and Raamah traded with you; they supplied you with the finest spices,
precious stones and gold for your merchandise.

Eze 27:23 Haran, Canneh and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur and Chilmad traded with you.

Eze 27:24 They traded rich clothes, embroidered and purple cloaks, multi-coloured materials and strong plaited
cords for your markets.

Eze 27:25 Ships of Tarshish sailed on your business; you were full and heavily loaded far out to sea.

Eze 27:26 Out to the open sea your oarsmen rowed you. The east wind has wrecked you far out to sea.

Eze 27:27 Your riches, your goods, your cargo, your seamen, your sailors, your caulkers, your commercial
agents, all the warriors you carry, and all the passengers who are aboard will founder far out to sea on the day of
your shipwreck.

Eze 27:28 When they hear the cries of your sailors the coasts will tremble.

Eze 27:29 Then the oarsmen will all desert their ships. The sailors and seafaring people will stay ashore.

Eze 27:30 They will raise their voices for you and weep bitterly. They will throw dust on their heads and roll in
ashes;

Eze 27:31 they will shave their heads for you and put sackcloth round their waists. With heartfelt bitterness they
will weep for you, bitterly wail.

Eze 27:32 Wailing, they will raise the lament for you, they will lament over you: Who is like Tyre, far out to sea?
Eze 27:33 When you unloaded your goods to satisfy so many peoples, you enriched the kings of the earth with
your excess of wealth and goods.

Eze 27:34 Now you have been wrecked by the waves, by the depths of the sea. Your cargo and all your
passengers have foundered with you.

Eze 27:35 All those who live in the islands will be stunned at your fate. Their kings will quake with horror, with
downcast expressions.

Eze 27:36 The merchants of the nations will whistle at your fate. You will be an object of terror, gone for ever’”.
Eze 28:1 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 28:2 “Son of man, say to the ruler of Tyre, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Because your heart has grown
proud, you thought: I am a god; I am divinely enthroned far out to sea. Though you are human, not divine, you
have allowed yourself to think like God.

Eze 28:3 So, you are wiser than Danel; no sage as wise as you!

Eze 28:4 By your wisdom and your intelligence you have made yourself a fortune, you have put gold and silver
into your treasuries.

Eze 28:5 Such is your skill in trading, your fortune has continued to increase, and your fortune has made your
heart grow prouder.

Eze 28:6 ‘And so, the Lord Yahweh says this: Since you have allowed yourself to think like God,



Eze 28:7 very well, I am going to bring foreigners against you, the most barbarous of the nations. They will draw
sword against your fine wisdom, they will desecrate your splendour,

Eze 28:8 they will throw you down into the grave and you will die a violent death far out to sea.

Eze 28:9 Will you still think: I am a god, when your slaughterers confront you? But you will be human, not divine,
in the clutches of the ones who strike you down!

Eze 28:10 You will die like the uncircumcised at the hand of foreigners. ‘For I have spoken — declares the Lord
Yahweh’”.

Eze 28:1 1 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 28:12 “Son of man, raise a lament for the king of Tyre. Say to him, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: You used
to be a model of perfection, full of wisdom, perfect in beauty;

Eze 28:13 you were in Eden, in the garden of God. All kinds of gem formed your mantle: sard, topaz, diamond,
chrysolite, onyx, jasper, sapphire, garnet, emerald, and your ear-pendants and spangles were made of gold; all
was ready on the day you were created.

Eze 28:14 I made you a living creature with outstretched wings, as guardian, you were on the holy mountain of
God; you walked amid red-hot coals.

Eze 28:15 Your behaviour was exemplary from the day you were created until guilt first appeared in you,

Eze 28:16 because your busy trading has filled you with violence and sin. I have thrown you down from the
mountain of God and destroyed you, guardian winged creature, amid the coals.

Eze 28:17 Your heart has grown proud because of your beauty, your wisdom has been corrupted by your
splendour. I have thrown you to the ground; I have made you a spectacle for kings.

Eze 28:18 By the immense number of your crimes, by the dishonesty of your trading, you have defiled your
sanctuary. So I have brought fire out of you to devour you; I have reduced you to ashes on the ground before the
eyes of all who saw you.

Eze 28:19 Of the nations, all who know you are stunned at your fate. You are an object of terror; gone for ever’.

i

Eze 28:20 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 28:21 “Son of man, turn towards Sidon and prophesy against her.

Eze 28:22 Say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: I am against you, Sidon, I will show my glory in you! They will
know I am Yahweh, once I execute sentence on her and display my holiness in her.

Eze 28:23 For I shall send her the plague, and there will be blood in her streets, and in her the dead will fall
under the sword raised against her from all sides, and they will know that I am Yahweh.

Eze 28:24 ‘No more, for the House of Israel, shall any of the hostile nations surrounding them be a thorn that
wounds or a briar that tears; and they will know that I am Yahweh.

Eze 28:25 ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: When I gather the House of Israel back from the peoples where they
are dispersed, I shall display my glory in them for the nations to see. They will live on the soil which I gave to my
servant Jacob.

Eze 28:26 They will live there in confidence, build houses, plant vineyards. They will live in safety, once I inflict
punishments on all the hostile nations surrounding them, and they will know that I am Yahweh their God’”.

Eze 29:1 In the tenth year, on the twelfth day of the tenth month, the word of Yahweh was addressed to me as
follows,

Eze 29:2 “Son of man, turn towards Pharaoh king of Egypt and prophesy against him and against the whole of
Egypt.

Eze 29:3 Speak and say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Look, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt- the great
crocodile wallowing in his Niles who thought: My Nile is mine, I made it.

Eze 29:4 I shall put hooks through your jaws, make your Nile fish stick to your scales, and pull you out of your
Niles with all your Nile fish sticking to your scales.

Eze 29:5 I shall drop you in the desert, with all your Nile fish. You will fall in the wilds and not be taken up or
buried. I shall give you as food to the wild animals and the birds of heaven,

Eze 29:6 and all the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am Yahweh, for they have given no more support than
a reed to the House of Israel.

Eze 29:7 Wherever they grasped you, you broke in their hands and cut their hands all over. Whenever they
leaned on you, you broke, making all their limbs give way.

Eze 29:8 ‘So, the Lord Yahweh says this: I shall send the sword against you to denude you of human and
animal.

Eze 29:9 Egypt will become a desolate waste, and they will know that I am Yahweh. Because he thought: The
Nile is mine, I made it,

Eze 29:10 very well, I am against you and your Niles. I shall make Egypt a waste and a desolation, from Migdol
to Syene and beyond to the frontiers of Ethiopia.

Eze 29:1 1 No human foot will pass through it, no animal foot will pass through it. For forty years it will remain



uninhabited.

Eze 29:12 I shall make Egypt the most desolate of countries; for forty years its cities will be the most desolate of
wasted cities. And I shall scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the countries.

Eze 29:13 The Lord Yahweh, however, says this: After forty years have passed, I shall gather the Egyptians
back from the nations where they were dispersed.

Eze 29:14 I shall bring the Egyptian captives back and re-install them in the land of Pathros, in the country of
their origin. There they will constitute a modest kingdom.

Eze 29:15 Egypt will be the most modest of kingdoms and no longer dominate other nations; for I shall reduce it,
so that it will not rule other nations ever again.

Eze 29:16 It will no longer be anything for the House of Israel to trust in, but will be a reminder of the guilt which
lay in turning to it for help. And they will know that I am Lord Yahweh’”.

Eze 29:17 In the twenty-seventh year, on the first day of the first month, the word of Yahweh was addressed to
me as follows:

Eze 29:18 “Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has taken his army in a great expedition against Tyre.
Their heads have all gone bald, their shoulders are all chafed, but even so he has derived no profit, either for
himself or for his army, from the expedition mounted against Tyre.

Eze 29:19 Since this is so, the Lord Yahweh says this, ‘Look, I shall hand Egypt over to Nebuchadnezzar king
of Babylon. He will carry off its riches, loot it, put it to the sack; that will be the wages for his army.

Eze 29:20 As wages for the trouble he has taken, I am giving him Egypt instead (for they have been working for
me)-declares the Lord Yahweh.

Eze 29:21 ‘That day, I shall raise up a new stock for the House of Israel and allow you to open your mouth
among them. And they will know that I am Yahweh’”.

Eze 30:1 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 30:2 “Son of man, prophesy and say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Howl: Disaster day!

Eze 30:3 For the day is near, the day of Yahweh is near; it will be a day dark with cloud, a time of doom for the
nations.

Eze 30:4 ‘The sword will come on Egypt, and anguish on the country of Cush when the slaughtered fall in
Egypt, when her riches are carried away and her foundations are destroyed.

Eze 30:5 Cush, Put and Lud, all Arabia, Cub and the children of the country of the covenant will fall by the
sword with them.

Eze 30:6 ‘Yahweh says this: ‘The supports of Egypt will fall; the pride of her strength will crumble; they will fall
by the sword from Migdol to Syene — declares the Lord Yahweh.

Eze 30:7 ‘They will be the most desolate of desolate countries, and its cities the most ruined of cities.

Eze 30:8 And they will know that I am Yahweh when I set fire to Egypt and all its supports are shattered.

Eze 30:9 ‘That day, I shall send messengers by ship to terrify the carefree Cushites, and anguish will overtake
them on the day of Egypt — it is coming now!

Eze 30:10 The Lord Yahweh says this: I shall destroy the huge population of Egypt at the hand of
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.

Eze 30:1 1 He and his people, the most barbarous of nations, will be brought to ravage the country. They will
draw the sword against Egypt and fill the country with corpses.

Eze 30:12 I shall dry up the courses of the Nile and sell the country to the wicked. I shall lay the whole country
waste and everything in it, at the hand of foreigners. I, Yahweh, have spoken.

Eze 30:13 ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: I shall destroy the foul idols and take the false gods away from Noph.
Egypt will be left without a ruler. I shall spread fear through Egypt.

Eze 30:14 I shall lay Pathros waste, set Zoan on fire, inflict my punishments on No.

Eze 30:15 I shall vent my fury on Sin, the bastion of Egypt; I shall wipe out the throngs of No.

Eze 30:16 I shall set fire to Egypt; Sin will be seized with convulsions; a breach will be opened at No and the
waters flood out.

Eze 30:17 The young men of On and Pi-Beseth will fall by the sword and the cities themselves go into captivity.
Eze 30:18 At Tahpanhes day will turn to darkness when I shatter the sceptres of Egypt there, when the pride of
her strength ceases. A cloud will cover Egypt itself, and its daughters will go into captivity.

Eze 30:19 Such will be the punishments I inflict on Egypt. And they will know that I am Yahweh’”.

Eze 30:20 In the eleventh year, on the seventh day of the first month, the word of Yahweh was addressed to me
as follows,

Eze 30:21 “Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; you can see that no one has dressed
his wound by applying remedies to it, by bandaging it and by dressing it, to make it strong enough to wield the
sword.

Eze 30:22 This being so, the Lord Yahweh says this, ‘Look, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt; I shall break
his arms, the sound one and the broken one, and make the sword drop from his hand.



Eze 30:23 I shall scatter Egypt among the nations and disperse it among the countries.

Eze 30:24 I shall strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and put my sword in his hand. I shall break
Pharaoh’s arms and, confronted with his enemy, he will groan like a dying man.

Eze 30:25 I shall strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh will fall. And they will
know that I am Yahweh, when I put my sword into the hands of the king of Babylon and he wields it against
Egypt.

Eze 30:26 I shall scatter Egypt among the nations and disperse it among the countries; and they will know that I
am Yahweh’”.

Eze 31:1 In the eleventh year, on the first day of the third month, the word of Yahweh was addressed to me as
follows,

Eze 31 :2 “Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and his throng of subjects: ‘What can compare with you for
greatness?

Eze 31 :3 I know: a cedar tree in the Lebanon with noble branches, dense foliage, lofty height. Its top pierces the
clouds.

Eze 31 :4 The waters have made it grow, the deep has made it tall, pouring its rivers round the place where it is
planted, sending rivulets to all the wild trees.

Eze 31 :5 This is why its height was greater than that of other wild trees, its branches increased in number, its
boughs stretched wide, because of the plentiful waters making it grow.

Eze 31 :6 All the birds of heaven nested in its branches; under its boughs all wild animals dropped their young; in
its shade sat many, many people.

Eze 31:7 It was beautiful in its size, in the span of its boughs; for its roots were in plentiful waters.

Eze 31 :8 There was no cedar like it in the garden of God, no cypress had branches such as these, no plane tree
could match its boughs, no tree in the garden of God could rival its beauty.

Eze 31 :9 I had made it so lovely with its many branches that it was the envy of every tree in Eden, in the garden
of God.

Eze 31:10 ‘Very well, the Lord Yahweh says this: ‘Since it has raised itself to its full height, has lifted its top into
the clouds, and has grown arrogant about its height,

Eze 31:11 I have handed it over to the prince of the nations, for him to treat as its wickedness deserves; I have
rejected it.

Eze 31:12 Foreigners, the most barbarous of nations, have cut it down and deserted it. On the mountains, in all
the valleys, lie its branches; its broken boughs are in every ravine throughout the country; everybody in the
country has fled its shade and deserted it.

Eze 31:13 On its wreckage perch all the birds of heaven; all the wild animals have advanced on its branches.
Eze 31:14 ‘So in future let no tree rear its height beside the waters, none push its top into the clouds, no
watered tree stretch its height towards them. For all of them are doomed to death, to the depths of the
underworld, with the common run of humanity, with those who sink into oblivion.

Eze 31:15 ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: The day it went down to Sheol, I imposed mourning, I closed the deep
over it. I stopped its rivers and the plentiful waters dried up; I made Lebanon dark because of it, and all the wild
trees wilted because of it.

Eze 31:16 With the noise when it fell I made the nations quake, as I hurled it down to Sheol, with those who sink
into oblivion. In the depths of the underworld all the trees of Eden took comfort, the pick of the loveliest trees of
the Lebanon, all irrigated by the waters.

Eze 31:17 And its offspring among the nations, once living in its shade, went down to Sheol with it, to those who
have been slaughtered by the sword.

Eze 31:18 ‘Which of the trees of Eden compares with you for glory and greatness? Yet you have been hurled
down with the trees of Eden, to the depths of the underworld, among the uncircumcised, and there you lie with
those who have been slaughtered by the sword. So much for Pharaoh and all his throng — declares the Lord
Yahweh’”.

Eze 32:1 In the twelfth year, on the first day of the twelfth month, the word of Yahweh was addressed to me as
follows,

Eze 32:2 “Son of man, raise a lament for Pharaoh king of Egypt. Say to him: ‘Young lion of nations, you are
destroyed! Once you were like a crocodile in the lagoons; emerging from your rivers, you churned up the water
with your trampling and fouled their streams.

Eze 32:3 ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: I shall throw my net over you in a great concourse of nations; and they
will trawl you up in my net. Then I shall leave you high and dry,

Eze 32:4 I shall throw you out into the wilds and make all the birds of heaven settle on you, and glut all the
beasts of the earth with you.

Eze 32:5 I shall strew your flesh on your mountains and fill the valleys with your corruption;

Eze 32:6 I shall water the country with what flows from you, with your blood, on the mountainsides, and you will



fill the ravines.

Eze 32:7 When I extinguish you I shall cover the skies and darken the stars. I shall cover the sun with clouds
and the moon will not give its light.

Eze 32:8 I shall dim every luminary in heaven because of you and cover your country in darkness -declares the
Lord Yahweh.

Eze 32:9 ‘I shall grieve the heart of many peoples when I bring about your destruction among the nations, in
countries unknown to you.

Eze 32:10 I shall stun many peoples with shock at your fate; their kings will tremble with horror at your fate,
when I brandish my sword before their eyes. The day you fall, each will tremble in terror for his life.

Eze 32:1 1 For the Lord Yahweh says this: The sword of the king of Babylon will overtake you.

Eze 32:12 I shall make your throngs of subjects fall at the swords of my warriors. They are the most barbarous
of nations. They will annihilate the pride of Egypt, and all its throngs will be destroyed.

Eze 32:13 I shall also destroy all its cattle beside the plentiful waters. No human foot will churn them, no animal
foot will churn them up again;

Eze 32:14 then I shall let their waters settle and make their rivers glide like oil — declares the Lord Yahweh.

Eze 32:15 ‘When I reduce Egypt to a ruin and the country is stripped of its contents, when I strike all those who
live there, they will know that I am Yahweh.

Eze 32:16 ‘Such is the lament which the daughters of the nations will raise. They will raise it over Egypt and all
its throng. This is the lament they will raise — declares the Lord Yahweh’”.

Eze 32:17 In the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the first month, the word of Yahweh was addressed to me
as follows,

Eze 32:18 “Son of man, lament over the throng of Egypt, for down she must go with the daughters of majestic
nations to the depths of the underworld with those who sink into oblivion.

Eze 32:19 “Whom do you surpass in beauty? Down with you, make your bed with the uncircumcised,

Eze 32:20 with those who have been slaughtered by the sword. (The sword has been given, it has been drawn.)
She and all her throngs have fallen.

Eze 32:21 From the depths of Sheol, the mightiest heroes, her allies, will say to her, ‘They have come down,
they have lain down, uncircumcised, slaughtered by the sword’.

Eze 32:22 “Assyria is there and all her hordes, with their graves all round her; all of them slaughtered, fallen by
the sword;

Eze 32:23 their graves have been made in the deepest part of the abyss, and her hordes, with their graves all
round her; all of them slaughtered, killed by the sword, who once spread terror through the world of the living.

Eze 32:24 “Elam is there and all her throng round her grave, all of them slaughtered, fallen by the sword; they
have gone down uncircumcised to the depths of the underworld, who once spread terror throughout the world of
the living. They have borne their shame with those who sink into oblivion.

Eze 32:25 Among the slaughtered, they have put a bed for her, among her throng with their tombs round her, all
of them uncircumcised, slaughtered by the sword for having spread terror throughout the world of the living.

They have borne their shame with those who sink into oblivion. They have been put among the slaughtered.

Eze 32:26 “Meshech, Tubal are there and all her throng, with their graves round her, all of them uncircumcised,
slaughtered by the sword for having spread terror through the world of the living.

Eze 32:27 They do not lie with the heroes who fell long ago, those who went down to Sheol fully armed, who
had their swords laid under their heads and their shields put under their bones, since the heroes inspired the
world of the living with terror.

Eze 32:28 But you will be broken with the uncircumcised and lie with those slaughtered by the sword.

Eze 32:29 “Edom is there, her kings and all her princes who, despite their valour, have been laid with those
slaughtered by the sword. They lie with the uncircumcised, with those who sink into oblivion.

Eze 32:30 “All the princes of the north and all the Sidonians are there, who have gone down with the
slaughtered, because of the terror which their power inspired. Ashamed, uncircumcised, they lie among those
slaughtered by the sword and bear their shame with those who sink into oblivion.

Eze 32:31 “Pharaoh will see them and take comfort at the sight of all this throng slaughtered by the sword —
Pharaoh and all his throng — declares the Lord Yahweh.

Eze 32:32 For having spread terror through the world of the living, he will be laid with the uncircumcised, with
those slaughtered by the sword, Pharaoh and all his throng — declares the Lord Yahweh”.

Eze 33:1 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 33:2 “Son of man, speak to the people of your country. Say to them, ‘When I send the sword against the
people of that country, take one of their number and post him as a watchman;

Eze 33:3 if he sees the sword coming against the country, he must sound his horn to warn the people.

Eze 33:4 If someöne hears the sound of the horn but pays no attention and the sword overtakes him and
destroys him, he will have been responsible for his own death.



Eze 33:5 He has heard the sound of the horn and paid no attention; his death will be his own responsibility. But
the life of someöne who pays attention will be secure.

Eze 33:6 ‘If, however, the watchman has seen the sword coming but has not blown his horn, and so the people
are not alerted and the sword overtakes them and destroys a single one of them, that person will indeed die for
his guilt, but I shall hold the watchman responsible for his death’.

Eze 33:7 “Son of man I have appointed you as watchman for the House of Israel. When you hear a word from
my mouth, warn them from me.

Eze 33:8 If I say to someöne wicked, ‘Evil- doer, you are to die’, and you do not speak to warn the wicked
person to renounce such ways, the wicked person will die for this guilt, but I shall hold you responsible for the
death.

Eze 33:9 If, however, you do warn someöne wicked to renounce such ways and repent, and that person does
not repent, then the culprit will die for this guilt, but you yourself will have saved your life.

Eze 33:10 “Son of man, say to the House of Israel, ‘You are continually saying: Our crimes and sins weigh
heavily on us; we are wasting away because of them. How are we to go on living?’.

Eze 33:1 1 Say to them, ‘As I live — declares the Lord Yahweh - I do not take pleasure in the death of the
wicked but in the conversion of the wicked who changes his ways and saves his life. Repent, turn back from your
evil ways. Why die, House of Israel?’.

Eze 33:12 “Son of man, say to the members of your nation, ‘The uprightness of an upright person will not save
him once he takes to wrong-doing; the wickedness of a wicked person will not ruin him once he renounces his
wickedness. No one upright will be able to live on the strength of uprightness, having once taken to sinning.

Eze 33:13 If I say to someöne upright: You are to live, and then, trusting in this uprightness, he does wrong,
none of the uprightness will be remembered; because of the wrong-doing, he will die.

Eze 33:14 If, however, I say to someöne wicked: You are to die, and he turns back from sin and does what is
lawful and upright,

Eze 33:15 if he returns pledges, restores what he has stolen, keeps the laws that give life and no longer does
wrong, he will live and will not die.

Eze 33:16 None of his previous sins will be remembered against him; having done what is lawful and upright, he
will live.

Eze 33:17 ‘But the members of your nation say: What the Lord does is unjust. But it is what you do that is
unjust.

Eze 33:18 When an upright person gives up being upright and does wrong, he dies for it.

Eze 33:19 And when a wicked person gives up being wicked and does what is lawful and upright, because of
this he lives.

Eze 33:20 But you say: What the Lord does is unjust! I shall judge each of you by what you do, House of Israel’.

i

Eze 33:21 In the twelfth year of our captivity, on the fifth day of the tenth month, a fugitive arrived from
Jerusalem and said to me, “The city has been taken”.

Eze 33:22 Now the hand of the Lord had been on me the evening before the fugitive arrived; he had opened my
mouth before the fugitive came to me the next morning; my mouth had been opened and I was dumb no longer.
Eze 33:23 The word of Yahweh was then addressed to me as follows,

Eze 33:24 “Son of man, the people living in those ruins on the soil of Israel say this, ‘Abraham was alone when
he was given possession of this country. But we are many; the country has been given us as our heritage’.

Eze 33:25 “Very well, tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: You eat blood, you raise your eyes to your foul
idols, you shed blood; are you to own the country?

Eze 33:26 You rely on your swords, you engage in loathsome practices, each of you defiles his neighbour’s
wife; are you to own the country?’.

Eze 33:27 Tell them this, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: As I live, I swear it, those in the ruins will fall to the
sword, those in the countryside I shall give to the wild animals for them to eat, and those among the crags and in
caves will die of plague.

Eze 33:28 I shall make the country a desolate waste, and the pride of its strength will be at an end. The
mountains of Israel will be deserted and no one will pass that way again.

Eze 33:29 Then they will know that I am Yahweh, when I make the country a desolate waste because of all the
filthy things they have done’.

Eze 33:30 “Son of man, the members of your nation are talking about you on the ramparts and in doorways.

They keep saying to one another, ‘Come and hear the word that has come from Yahweh’.

Eze 33:31 They throng towards you; my people sit down in front of you and listen to your words, but they do not
act on them. What they act on is the lie in their mouths, and their hearts are set on dishonest gain.

Eze 33:32 As far as they are concerned, you are like a love song pleasantly sung to a good musical
accompaniment. They listen to your words, but no one acts on them.



Eze 33:33 When the thing takes place — and it is beginning now — they will know that there has been a prophet
among them”.

Eze 34:1 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 34:2 “Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel; prophesy and say to them, ‘Shepherds, the
Lord Yahweh says this: Disaster is in store for the shepherds of Israel who feed themselves! Are not shepherds
meant to feed a flock?

Eze 34:3 Yet you have fed on milk, you have dressed yourselves in wool, you have sacrificed the fattest sheep,
but failed to feed the flock.

Eze 34:4 You have failed to make weak sheep strong, or to care for the sick ones, or bandage the injured ones.
You have failed to bring back strays or look for the lost. On the contrary, you have ruled them cruelly and
harshly.

Eze 34:5 For lack of a shepherd they have been scattered, to become the prey of all the wild animals; they have
been scattered.

Eze 34:6 My flock is astray on every mountain and on every high hill; my flock has been scattered all over the
world; no one bothers about them and no one looks for them.

Eze 34:7 ‘Very well, shepherds, hear the word of Yahweh:

Eze 34:8 As I live, I swear it — declares the Lord Yahweh — since my flock has been pillaged and for lack of a
shepherd is now the prey of every wild animal, since my shepherds have ceased to bother about my flock, since
my shepherds feed themselves rather than my flock,

Eze 34:9 very well, shepherds, hear the word of Yahweh:

Eze 34: 1 0 The Lord Yahweh says this: Look, I am against the shepherds. I shall take my flock out of their
charge and henceforth not allow them to feed my flock. And the shepherds will stop feeding themselves,
because I shall rescue my sheep from their mouths to stop them from being food for them.

Eze 34: 1 1 ‘For the Lord Yahweh says this: Look, I myself shall take care of my flock and look after it.

Eze 34:12 As a shepherd looks after his flock when he is with his scattered sheep, so shall I look after my
sheep. I shall rescue them from wherever they have been scattered on the day of clouds and darkness.

Eze 34:13 I shall bring them back from the peoples where they are; I shall gather them back from the countries
and bring them back to their own land. I shall pasture them on the mountains of Israel, in the ravines and in all
the inhabited parts of the country.

Eze 34:14 I shall feed them in good pasturage; the highest mountains of Israel will be their grazing ground.
There they will rest in good grazing grounds; they will browse in rich pastures on the mountains of Israel.

Eze 34:15 I myself shall pasture my sheep, I myself shall give them rest — declares the Lord Yahweh.

Eze 34:16 I shall look for the lost one, bring back the stray, bandage the injured and make the sick strong. I
shall watch over the fat and healthy. I shall be a true shepherd to them.

Eze 34:17 ‘As for you, my sheep, the Lord Yahweh says this: I shall judge between sheep and sheep, between
rams and he-goats.

Eze 34:18 Not content to drink the clearest of the water, you foul the rest with your feet.

Eze 34:19 And my sheep must graze on what your feet have trampled and drink what your feet have fouled.

Eze 34:20 Very well, the Lord Yahweh says this: I myself shall judge between the fat sheep and the thin sheep.
Eze 34:21 Since you have jostled with flank and shoulder and butted all the ailing sheep with your horns, until
you have scattered them outside,

Eze 34:22 I shall come and save my sheep and stop them from being victimised. I shall judge between sheep
and sheep.

Eze 34:23 ‘I shall raise up one shepherd, my servant David, and put him in charge of them to pasture them; he
will pasture them and be their shepherd.

Eze 34:24 I, Yahweh, shall be their God, and my servant David will be ruler among them. I, Yahweh, have
spoken.

Eze 34:25 I shall make a covenant of peace with them; I shall rid the country of wild animals. They will be able
to live secure in the desert and go to sleep in the woods.

Eze 34:26 I shall settle them round my hill; I shall send rain at the proper time; it will be a rain of blessings.

Eze 34:27 The trees of the countryside will yield their fruit and the soil will yield its produce; they will be secure
on their soil. And they will know that I am Yahweh when I break the bars of their yoke and rescue them from the
clutches of their slave-masters.

Eze 34:28 No more will they be a prey to the nations, no more will the wild animals of the country devour them.
They will live secure, with no one to frighten them.

Eze 34:29 I shall make splendid vegetation grow for them; no more will they suffer from famine in the country;
no more will they have to bear the insults of other nations.

Eze 34:30 So they will know that I, their God, am with them and that they, the House of Israel, are my people —
declares the Lord Yahweh.



Eze 34:31 And you, my sheep, are the flock of my human pasture, and I am your God — declares the Lord
Yahweh’”.

Eze 35:1 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 35:2 “Son of man, turn towards Mount Seir and prophesy against it.

Eze 35:3 Say to it, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Look, I am against you, Mount Seir; I shall stretch out my hand
against you; I shall make you a desolate waste;

Eze 35:4 I shall lay your towns in ruins. You will become a waste and you will know that I am Yahweh.

Eze 35:5 Since, following a long-standing hatred, you betrayed the Israelites to the sword on the day of their
distress, on the day when an end came for their guilt,

Eze 35:6 very well, as I live - declares the Lord Yahweh — 1 destine you to bloodshed, and bloodshed will
pursue you. I swear it; you have incurred guilt by shedding blood, and bloodshed will pursue you.

Eze 35:7 I shall make Mount Seir a desolate waste and denude it of anyone travelling to and fro.

Eze 35:8 I shall fill its mountains with its slaughtered; on your hills, in your valleys and in all your ravines, those
slaughtered by the sword will fall.

Eze 35:9 I shall make you a perpetual waste, your towns will never be inhabited again, and you will know that I
am Yahweh.

Eze 35:10 ‘Since you said: The two nations and the two countries will be mine; we are going to take possession
of it, although Yahweh was there,

Eze 35:1 1 very well, as I live — declares the Lord Yahweh — 1 shall act with the same anger and jealousy as you
acted in your hatred for them. I shall make myself known for their sake, when I punish you,

Eze 35:12 and you will know that I, Yahweh, have heard all the blasphemies which you have uttered against the
mountains of Israel, such as: They have been laid waste, they have been given to us for us to devour.

Eze 35:13 Great was your insolence towards me, many your speeches against me; I have heard!

Eze 35:14 Lord Yahweh says this: To the joy of the whole world, I shall make you a waste.

Eze 35:15 Since you rejoiced because the heritage of the House of Israel had been laid waste, I shall do the
same to you, Mount Seir; and you will become a waste, and so will the whole of Edom; and they will know that I
am Yahweh”. ‘

Eze 36:1 “Son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel. Say, ‘Mountains of Israel, hear the word of Yahweh.
Eze 36:2 The Lord Yahweh says this: Since the enemy has gloated over you by saying: Aha! These eternal
heights are owned by us now,

Eze 36:3 very well, prophesy! Say: The Lord Yahweh says this: Since you have been ravaged and seized on
from all sides, and have become the property of the rest of the nations, and become the subject of people’s talk
and gossip,

Eze 36:4 very well, mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Yahweh! The Lord Yahweh says this to the
mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys, to the devastated ruins and abandoned cities which have been
put to the sack and have become a laughing-stock to the rest of the nations all round;

Eze 36:5 very well, the Lord Yahweh says this: I swear it in the heat of my jealousy; I am speaking to the rest of
the nations and to the whole of Edom who so exultantly and contemptuously took possession of my country to
despoil its pastureland’.

Eze 36:6 “Because of this, prophesy about the land of Israel. Say to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and
valleys, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: I am speaking in my jealousy and rage; because you are enduring the
insults of the nations,

Eze 36:7 very well, the Lord Yahweh says this: I raise my hand and I swear that the nations all around you shall
have their own insults to bear.

Eze 36:8 ‘Mountains of Israel, you will grow branches and bear fruit for my people Israel, who will soon return.
Eze 36:9 Yes, I am coming to you, I shall turn to you; you will be tilled and sown.

Eze 36:10 I shall increase your population, the whole House of Israel, yes, all. The cities will be inhabited and
the ruins rebuilt.

Eze 36:1 1 I shall increase your population, both human and animal; they will be fertile and reproduce. I shall
repopulate you as you were before; I shall make you more prosperous than you were before, and you will know
that I am Yahweh.

Eze 36:12 Thanks to me, men will tread your soil again, my people Israel; they will own you and you will be their
heritage, and never again will you rob them of their children.

Eze 36:13 ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Since people have said of you: You are a man-eater, you have robbed
your nation of its children,

Eze 36:14 very well, you will eat no more men, never rob your nation of its children again — declares the Lord
Yahweh.

Eze 36:15 I shall never again let you hear the insults of the nations, you will never again have to bear the taunts
of the peoples, you will never again rob the nation of its children — declares the Lord Yahweh’”.



Eze 36:16 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 36:17 “Son of man, the members of the House of Israel used to live in their own territory, but they defiled it
by their conduct and actions; to me their conduct was as unclean as a woman’s menstruation.

Eze 36:18 I then vented my fury on them because of the blood they shed in the country and the foul idols with
which they defiled it.

Eze 36:19 I scattered them among the nations and they were dispersed throughout the countries. I sentenced
them as their conduct and actions deserved.

Eze 36:20 They have profaned my holy name among the nations where they have gone, so that people say of
them, ‘These are the people of Yahweh; they have been exiled from his land’.

Eze 36:21 But I have been concerned about my holy name, which the House of Israel has profaned among the
nations where they have gone.

Eze 36:22 And so, say to the House of Israel, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: I am acting not for your sake, House
of Israel, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations where you have gone.
Eze 36:23 I am going to display the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among the nations,
which you have profaned among them. And the nations will know that I am Yahweh — declares the Lord Yahweh
— when in you I display my holiness before their eyes.

Eze 36:24 For I shall take you from among the nations and gather you back from all the countries, and bring you
home to your own country.

Eze 36:25 I shall pour clean water over you and you will be cleansed; I shall cleanse you of all your filth and of
all your foul idols.

Eze 36:26 I shall give you a new heart, and put a new spirit in you; I shall remove the heart of stone from your
bodies and give you a heart of flesh instead.

Eze 36:27 I shall put my spirit in you, and make you keep my laws, and respect and practise my judgements.
Eze 36:28 You will live in the country which I gave your ancestors. You will be my people and I shall be your
God.

Eze 36:29 I shall save you from everything that defiles you, I shall summon the wheat and make it plentiful and
impose no more famines on you.

Eze 36:30 I shall increase the yield of tree and field, so that you will never again bear the ignominy of famine
among the nations.

Eze 36:31 Then you will remember your evil conduct and actions. You will loathe yourselves for your guilt and
your loathsome practices.

Eze 36:32 I assure you that I am not doing this for your sake — declares the Lord Yahweh. Be ashamed and
blush for your conduct, House of Israel.

Eze 36:33 ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: On the day I cleanse you from all your guilt, I shall repopulate the cities
and cause the ruins to be rebuilt.

Eze 36:34 Waste land, once desolate for every passer-by to see, will now be farmed again.

Eze 36:35 And people will say: This land, so recently a waste, is now like a garden of Eden, and the ruined
cities once abandoned and levelled to the ground are now strongholds with people living in them.

Eze 36:36 And the nations left round you will know that I, Yahweh, have rebuilt what was levelled and replanted
what was ruined. I, Yahweh, have spoken and shall do it.

Eze 36:37 ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: As a further mark of favour, I shall let myself be consulted by the House
of Israel; I shall increase their numbers like a human flock,

Eze 36:38 like a flock of sacrificial animals, like the flock in Jerusalem on her solemn feasts. So your ruined
cities will be filled with human flocks, and they will know that I am Yahweh’”.

Eze 37:1 The hand of Yahweh was on me; he carried me away by the spirit of Yahweh and set me down in the
middle of the valley, a valley full of bones.

Eze 37:2 He made me walk up and down and all around among them. There were vast quantities of these
bones on the floor of the valley; and they were completely dry.

Eze 37:3 He said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?”. I said, “You know, Lord Yahweh”.

Eze 37:4 He said, “Prophesy over these bones. Say, ‘Dry bones, hear the word of Yahweh.

Eze 37:5 The Lord Yahweh says this to these bones: I am now going to make breath enter you, and you will
live.

Eze 37:6 I shall put sinews on you, I shall make flesh grow on you, I shall cover you with skin and give you
breath, and you will live; and you will know that I am Yahweh’”.

Eze 37:7 I prophesied as I had been ordered. While I was prophesying, there was a noise, a clattering sound; it
was the bones coming together.

Eze 37:8 And as I looked, they were covered with sinews; flesh was growing on them and skin was covering
them, yet there was no breath in them.

Eze 37:9 He said to me, “Prophesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man. Say to the breath, ‘The Lord Yahweh



says this: Come from the four winds, breath; breathe on these dead, so that they come to life!’”.

Eze 37:10 I prophesied as he had ordered me, and the breath entered them; they came to life and stood up on
their feet, a great, an immense army.

Eze 37:1 1 Then he said, “Son of man, these bones are the whole House of Israel. They keep saying, ‘Our
bones are dry, our hope has gone; we are done for’.

Eze 37:12 So, prophesy. Say to them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: I am now going to open your graves; I shall
raise you from your graves, my people, and lead you back to the soil of Israel.

Eze 37:13 And you will know that I am Yahweh, when I open your graves and raise you from your graves, my
people,

Eze 37:14 and put my spirit in you, and you revive, and I resettle you on your own soil. Then you will know that
I, Yahweh, have spoken and done this — declares the Lord Yahweh’”.

Eze 37:15 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 37:16 “Son of man, take a stick and write on it, ‘Judah and those Israelites loyal to him’. Take another stick
and write on it, ‘Joseph (Ephraim’s wood) and all the House of Israel loyal to him’.

Eze 37:17 “Join one to the other to make a single piece of wood, a single stick in your hand.

Eze 37:18 And when the members of your nation say, ‘Will you not tell us what you mean?’.

Eze 37:19 say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: I am taking the stick of Joseph (now in Ephraim’s hand) and those
tribes of Israel loyal to him and shall join them to the stick of Judah. I shall make one stick out of the two, a single
stick in my hand’.

Eze 37:20 “When the pieces of wood you have written on are in your hand in full sight of them,

Eze 37:21 say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: I shall take the Israelites from the nations where they have gone. I
shall gather them to- gether from everywhere and bring them home to their own soil.

Eze 37:22 I shall make them into one nation in the country, on the mountains of Israel, and one king is to be
king of them all; they will no longer form two nations, nor be two separate kingdoms.

Eze 37:23 They will no longer defile themselves with their foul idols, their horrors and any of their crimes. I shall
save them from the acts of infidelity which they have committed and shall cleanse them; they will be my people
and I shall be their God.

Eze 37:24 My servant David will reign over them, one shepherd for all; they will follow my judgements, respect
my laws and practise them.

Eze 37:25 They will live in the country which I gave to my servant Jacob, the country in which your ancestors
lived. They will live in it, they, their children, their children’s children, for ever. David my servant is to be their
prince for ever.

Eze 37:26 I shall make a covenant of peace with them, an eternal covenant with them. I shall resettle them and
make them grow; I shall set my sanctuary among them for ever.

Eze 37:27 I shall make my home above them; I shall be their God, and they will be my people.

Eze 37:28 And the nations will know that I am Yahweh the sanctifier of Israel, when my sanctuary is with them
for ever’”.

Eze 38:1 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Eze 38:2 “Son of man, turn towards Gog, to the country of Magog, towards the paramount prince of Meshech
and Tubal, and prophesy against him.

Eze 38:3 Say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: I am against you, Gog, paramount prince of Meshech and Tubal.
Eze 38:4 I shall turn you about, I shall fix hooks in your jaws and bring you out with your entire army, horses and
horsemen, all perfectly equipped, a huge array armed with shields and bucklers, and all wielding swords.

Eze 38:5 Persia and Cush and Put are with them, all with buckler and helmet;

Eze 38:6 Gomer and all its troops, Beth-Togarmah in the far north and all its troops, and many nations with you.
Eze 38:7 Be ready, be well prepared, you and all your troops and the others rallying to you, and hold yourself at
my service.

Eze 38:8 ‘Many days will pass before you are given orders; in the final years you will march on this country,
whose inhabitants will have been living in confidence, remote from other peoples, since they escaped the sword
and were gathered in from various nations, here in the long-deserted mountains of Israel.

Eze 38:9 Like a storm you will approach, you will advance and cover the country like a cloud, you, all your
troops and many nations with you.

Eze 38:10 ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: That day, a thought will enter your mind and you will form a sinister
plan.

Eze 38:1 1 You will think: I shall attack this undefended country and march on this peaceful nation living secure,
all living in towns without walls or bars or gates.

Eze 38:12 You will come to plunder and loot and turn your might against the ruins they live in, against this
people gathered back from the nations, these stock-breeders and traders who live at the Navel of the World.

Eze 38:13 Sheba and Dedan, the merchants and all the magnates of Tarshish will ask you: Have you come for



plunder? Are you massing your troops with a view to looting? To make off with gold and silver, seize cattle and
goods, and come away with unlimited spoil?’.

Eze 38:14 “So, son of man, prophesy. Say to Gog, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Is it not true that you will set out
at a time when my people Israel is living secure?

Eze 38:15 You will leave your home in the far north, you and many nations with you, a great army of countless
troops all mounted.

Eze 38:16 You will invade Israel, my people. You will be like a cloud covering the country. In the final days, I
myself shall bring you to attack my country, so that the nations will know who I am, when I display my holiness to
them, by means of you, Gog.

Eze 38:17 ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: It was of you that I spoke in the past through my servants the prophets
of Israel, who prophesied in those days, foretelling your invasion.

Eze 38:18 The day Gog attacks the land of Israel — declares the Lord Yahweh — my furious wrath will boil up. In
my anger,

Eze 38:19 in my jealousy, in the heat of my fury I say it: That day, I swear, there will be such a huge earthquake
in the land of Israel,

Eze 38:20 that the fish in the sea and the birds of heaven, the wild beasts, all the reptiles creeping along the
ground, and all people on the surface of the earth will quake before me. Mountains will fall, cliffs crumble, all
walls collapse, and

Eze 38:21 I shall summon every kind of sword against him - declares the Lord Yahweh — and each will turn his
sword against his comrade.

Eze 38:22 I shall punish him with plague and bloodshed, and rain down torrential rain, hailstones, fire and
brimstone on him, on his troops and on the many nations with him.

Eze 38:23 I shall display my greatness and holiness and bring the many nations to acknowledge me; and they
will know that I am Yahweh’”.

Eze 39:1 “So, son of man, prophesy against Gog. Say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Look, I am against you,
Gog, paramount prince of Meshech and Tubal.

Eze 39:2 I shall turn you about, lead you on, and bring you from the farthest north against the mountains of
Israel.

Eze 39:3 I shall break the bow in your left hand and dash the arrows out of your right.

Eze 39:4 You will fall on the mountains of Israel, you, all your troops and the nations with you. I shall make you
food for every kind of bird of prey and wild animals.

Eze 39:5 You will fall in the wilds, for I have spoken — declares the Lord Yahweh.

Eze 39:6 I shall send down fire on Magog and on those living undisturbed in the islands, and they will know that
I am Yahweh.

Eze 39:7 I shall see that my holy name is acknowledged by my people Israel, and no longer allow my holy name
to be profaned; and the nations will know that I am Yahweh, holy in Israel.

Eze 39:8 ‘All this is to happen, all this is to take place — declares the Lord Yahweh. This is the day I predicted.
Eze 39:9 ‘The inhabitants of the towns of Israel will go out and set fire to and burn the weapons, the shields and
bucklers, bows and arrows, javelins and spears. They will burn these for seven years
Eze 39:10 and not fetch wood from the countryside or cut it in the forests, since they will be burning the
weapons. They will plunder those who plundered them, and despoil those who despoiled them — declares the
Lord Yahweh.

Eze 39:1 1 ‘That day, I shall give Gog a famous spot in Israel for his grave, the valley of the Obarim, east of the
Sea — the valley that halts the traveller — and there Gog and his whole throng will be buried, and it will be called
the Valley of Hamon-Gog.

Eze 39:12 The House of Israel will take seven months to bury them and cleanse the country.

Eze 39:13 All the people of the country will dig their graves, thus winning themselves renown, the day when I
display my glory — declares the Lord Yahweh.

Eze 39:14 And men will be detailed to the permanent duty of going through the country and burying those left
above ground and cleansing it. They will begin their search once the seven months are over,

Eze 39:15 and as they go through the country, if one of them sees any human bones, he will set up a marker

beside them until the gravediggers have buried them in the valley of Hamon-Gog

Eze 39:16 (and Hamonah is also the name of a town) and have cleansed the country’.

Eze 39:17 “Son of man, the Lord Yahweh says this, ‘Say to the birds of every kind and to all the wild animals:
Muster, come, gather from everywhere around for the sacrifice I am making for you, a great sacrifice on the
mountains of Israel, so that you can eat flesh and drink blood.

Eze 39:18 You will eat the flesh of heroes, you will drink the blood of the princes of the world. They are all rams
and lambs, goats and fat bulls of Bashan.

Eze 39:19 You will glut yourselves on fat and drink yourselves drunk on blood at this sacrifice I am making for



you.

Eze 39:20 You will glut yourselves at my table on horses and chargers, on heroes and every kind of warrior —
declares the Lord Yahweh’.

Eze 39:21 “I shall display my glory to the nations, and all nations will see my sentence when I inflict it and my
hand when I strike them.

Eze 39:22 The House of Israel will know that I am Yahweh their God, from that day forward for ever.

Eze 39:23 The nations too will know that the House of Israel were exiled for their guilt; because they were
unfaithful to me, I hid my face from them and put them into the clutches of their enemies, so that they all fell by
the sword.

Eze 39:24 I treated them as their loathsome acts of infidelity deserved and hid my face from them.

Eze 39:25 “So, the Lord Yahweh says this, ‘Now I shall bring Jacob’s captives back and take pity on the whole
House of Israel and show myself jealous for my holy name.

Eze 39:26 They will forget their disgrace and all the acts of infidelity which they committed against me when
they were living safely in their own country, with no one to disturb them.

Eze 39:27 When I bring them home from the peoples, when I gather them back from the countries of their
enemies, when I display my holiness in them for many nations to see,

Eze 39:28 they will know that I am Yahweh their God who, having sent them into exile among the nations, have
reunited them in their own country, not leaving a single one behind.

Eze 39:29 I shall never hide my face from them again, since I shall pour out my spirit on the House of Israel —
declares the Lord Yahweh’”.

Eze 40:1 In the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month,
fourteen years to the day from the capture of the city, the hand of Yahweh was on me. He carried me away:

Eze 40:2 in divine visions, he carried me away to the land of Israel and put me down on a very high mountain,
on the south of which there seemed to be built a city.

Eze 40:3 He took me to it, and there I saw a man, whose appearance was like brass. He had a flax cord and a
measuring rod in his hand and was standing in the gateway.

Eze 40:4 The man said to me, “Son of man, look carefully, listen closely and pay attention to everything I show
you, since you have been brought here only for me to show it to you. Tell the House of Israel everything that you
see”.

Eze 40:5 Now, the Temple was surrounded on all sides by an outer wall. The man was holding a measuring rod
six cubits long, each cubit a forearm and a handsbreadth. He measured the thickness of this construction — one
rod; and its height — one rod.

Eze 40:6 He went to the east gate, climbed the steps and measured its threshold: one rod deep.

Eze 40:7 Each guardroom one rod by one rod; and the piers between the guardrooms five cubits thick, and the
threshold of the gate inwards from the porch of the gate: one rod.

Eze 40:8

Eze 40:9 He measured the porch of the gate: eight cubits; its piers: two cubits; the porch of the gate was at the
inner end.

Eze 40:10 There were three guardrooms on each side of the east gate, all three of the same size; the piers
between them all of the same thickness each side.

Eze 40:1 1 He measured the width of the entrance: ten cubits; and the width all down the gateway: thirteen
cubits.

Eze 40:12 There was a rail in front of the guardrooms; each rail on either side was one cubit. And the
guardrooms on either side were six cubits square.

Eze 40:13 He measured the width of the gate from the back wall of one guardroom to the back wall of the other;
it was twenty-five cubits across, the openings being opposite each other.

Eze 40:14 He measured the porch: twenty cubits; the court surrounded the gate on all sides.

Eze 40:15 From the front of the entrance gate, to the far end of the porch of the inner gate: fifty cubits.

Eze 40:16 All round inside the gate there were trellised windows in the guardrooms and in their piers; similarly,
in the porch there were windows all round and palm trees on the piers.

Eze 40:17 He then took me to the outer court, which had rooms and a paved terrace going all the way round;
there were thirty rooms on this terrace.

Eze 40:18 This terrace, which came up to the sides of the gates and matched their depth, was the Lower
Terrace. He measured the width of the court,

Eze 40:19 from the front of the lower gate to the fac ade of the inner court, outside: a hundred cubits (on the
east and on the north).

Eze 40:20 He measured the length and breadth of the north gate of the outer court.

Eze 40:21 It had three guardrooms on each side; its piers and porch were of the same size as those of the first
gate: fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.



Eze 40:22 Its windows, its porch and its palm trees were of the same size as those of the east gate. There were
seven steps up to it, and its porch was at the inner end.

Eze 40:23 In the inner court there was, opposite the north gate, a gate like the one opposite the east gate. He
measured the distance from one gate to the other: a hundred cubits.

Eze 40:24 He took me to the south side where there was a south gate; he measured its guardrooms, piers and
porch; they were of the same size as the others.

Eze 40:25 The gateway, as well as its porch, had windows all round, like the windows of the others; it was fifty
cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide,

Eze 40:26 and it had seven steps up to it; its porch was at the inner end and had palm trees on its piers, one on
either side.

Eze 40:27 The inner court had a south gate; he measured the distance southwards from one gate to the other: a
hundred cubits.

Eze 40:28 He then took me into the inner court by the south gate; he measured the south gate which was of the
same size as the others.

Eze 40:29 Its guardrooms, piers and porch were of the same size as the others.

Eze 40:30 The gateway, as well as its porch, had windows all round; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five
cubits wide.

Eze 40:31 The porch gave on to the outer court. It had palm trees on its piers and eight steps leading up to it.
Eze 40:32 He took me to the eastern part of the inner court and measured the gate. It was of the same size as
the others.

Eze 40:33 Its guardrooms, piers and porch were of the same size as the others. The gateway, as well as its
porch, had windows all round; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.

Eze 40:34 Its porch gave on to the outer court. There were palm trees on its piers on either side and eight steps
leading up to it.

Eze 40:35 He then took me to the north gate and measured it.

Eze 40:36 Its guardrooms, piers and porch were of the same size as the others. The gateway had windows all
round; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide.

Eze 40:37 Its porch gave on to the outer court. There were palm trees on its piers on either side and eight steps
leading up to it.

Eze 40:38 There was a room, the entrance to which was in the porch of the gateway, where they washed the
burnt offerings.

Eze 40:39 And inside the porch of the gateway were slabs, two on either side, for slaughtering the burnt
offerings, the sacrifice for sin and the sacrifice of reparation.

Eze 40:40 Outside, at the approach to the entrance of the north gate, were two slabs, and on the other side, at
the porch end of the gate were two slabs.

Eze 40:41 There were four slabs on one side and four slabs on the other side of the gateway, eight slabs in all,
on which the slaughtering was done.

Eze 40:42 There were also four slabs of dressed stone for the burnt offerings, a cubit and a half long, a cubit
and a half wide and a cubit high, on which the instruments for slaughtering the burnt offerings and sacrifice were
placed;

Eze 40:43 runnels a handsbreadth wide went all round the top, and on these slabs was put the sacrificial flesh.
Eze 40:44 Then he took me into the inner court; there were two rooms in the inner court, one on the side of the
north gate, facing south, the other on the side of the south gate, facing north.

Eze 40:45 He told me, “The room looking south is for the priests responsible for the service of the Temple,

Eze 40:46 and the room looking north is for the priests responsible for the service of the altar. These are the
sons of Zadok, those of the sons of Levi who approach Yahweh to serve him”.

Eze 40:47 He measured the court; it was a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits wide, a square with the
altar standing in front of the Temple.

Eze 40:48 He took me to the Ulam of the Temple and measured the piers of the Ulam: five cubits either side;
and the width of the entrance was three cubits either side.

Eze 40:49 The length of the Ulam was twenty cubits and its width twelve cubits. There were ten steps leading
up to it, and there were columns by the piers, one on either side.

Eze 41:1 He took me to the Hekal and measured its piers: six cubits wide on the one side, six cubits wide on the
other.

Eze 41 :2 The width of the entrance was ten cubits, and the returns of the entrance were five cubits on the one
side and five cubits on the other. He measured its length: forty cubits; and its width: twenty cubits.

Eze 41 :3 He then went inside and measured the pier at the entrance: two cubits; then the entrance; six cubits;
and the returns of the entrance: seven cubits.

Eze 41 :4 He measured its length; twenty cubits; and its width against the Hekal: twenty cubits. He then said to



me, This is the Holy of Holies”.

Eze 41 :5 He then measured the wall of the Temple: six cubits. The width of the lateral structure was four cubits,
all round the Temple.

Eze 41 :6 The cells were one above the other in three tiers of thirty cells each. The cells were recessed into the
wall, the wall of the structure comprising the cells, all round, forming offsets; but there were no offsets in the wall
of the Temple itself.

Eze 41 :7 The width of the cells increased, storey by storey, corresponding to the amount taken in from the wall
from one storey to the next, all round the Temple.

Eze 41 :8 Then I saw that there was a paved terrace all round the Temple. The height of this, which formed the
base of the side cells, was one complete rod of six cubits.

Eze 41 :9 The outer wall of the side cells was five cubits thick. There was a passage between the cells of the
Temple

Eze 41:10 and the rooms, twenty cubits wide, all round the Temple.

Eze 41:11 As a way in to the lateral cells on the passage there was one entrance on the north side and one
entrance on the south side. The width of the passage was five cubits right round.

Eze 41:12 The building on the west side of the court was seventy cubits wide, the wall of the building was five
cubits thick all round and its length was ninety cubits.

Eze 41:13 He measured the length of the Temple: a hundred cubits.

Eze 41:14 The length of the court plus the building and its walls: a hundred cubits.

Eze 41:15 He measured the length of the building, along the court, at the back, and its galleries on either side: a
hundred cubits. The inside of the Hekal and the porches of the court,

Eze 41:16 the thresholds, the windows, the galleries on three sides, facing the threshold, were panelled with
wood all round from floor to windows, and the windows were screened with latticework.

Eze 41:17 From the door to the inner part of the Temple, as well as outside, and on the wall all round, both
inside and out,

Eze 41:18 were carved great winged creatures and palm trees, one palm tree between two winged creatures;
each winged creature had two faces:

Eze 41:19 a human face turned towards the palm tree on one side and the face of a lion towards the palm tree
on the other side, throughout the Temple, all round.

Eze 41 :20 Winged creatures and palm trees were carved on the wall from the floor to above the entrance.

Eze 41 :21 The doorposts of the Temple were square. In front of the sanctuary there was something like
Eze 41 :22 a wooden altar, three cubits high and two cubits square. Its corners, base and sides were of wood.

He said to me, This is the table in the presence of Yahweh”.

Eze 41 :23 The Hekal had double doors and the sanctuary

Eze 41 :24 double doors. These doors had two hinged leaves, two leaves for the one door, two leaves for the
other.

Eze 41 :25 On them (on the doors of the Hekal), were carved great winged creatures and palm trees like those
carved on the walls. There was a wooden porch roof on the front of the Ulam on the outside,

Eze 41 :26 and windows with flanking palm trees on the sides of the Ulam, the cells to the side of the Temple
and the porch-roofs.

Eze 42:1 He then took me out into the outer court on the north side and led me to the room facing the court, that
is to say, to the front of the building on the north side.

Eze 42:2 Along the front, it was a hundred cubits long on the north side and fifty cubits wide.

Eze 42:3 Facing the gateways of the inner court and facing the paving of the outer court was a gallery in front of
the triple gallery,

Eze 42:4 and in front of the rooms was a walk, ten cubits measured inwards and a hundred cubits long; their
doors looked north.

Eze 42:5 The top-floor rooms were narrow because the galleries took up part of the width, being narrower than
those on the ground floor or those on the middle floor of the building;

Eze 42:6 these were divided into three storeys and had no columns such as the court had. Hence they were
narrower than the ground floor ones or the middle-floor ones (below them).

Eze 42:7 The outer wall parallel to the rooms, facing them and giving onto the outer court, was fifty cubits long,
Eze 42:8 the length of the rooms facing the outer court being fifty cubits, while for those facing the hall of the
Temple it was a hundred cubits.

Eze 42:9 Beneath the rooms there was an entrance from the east, leading in from the outer court.

Eze 42:10 In the thickness of the wall of the court, on the south side fronting the court and the building, were
rooms.

Eze 42:1 1 A walk ran in front of them, as with the rooms built on the north side; they were of the same length
and breadth, and were of similar design with similar doors in and out.



Eze 42:12 Before the rooms on the south side there was an entrance at the end of each walk, opposite the
corresponding wall on the east side, at their entries.

Eze 42:13 He said to me, The northern and southern rooms giving onto the court are the rooms of the
sanctuary, in which the priests who approach Yahweh will eat the most holy things. In them will be placed the
most holy things: the oblation, the sacrifice for sin and the sacrifice of reparation, since this is a holy place.

Eze 42:14 Once the priests have entered, they will not go out of the holy place into the outer court without
leaving their liturgical vestments there, since these vestments are holy; they will put on other clothes before
going near places assigned to the people”.

Eze 42:15 When he had finished measuring the inside of the Temple, he took me out to the east gate and
measured it right round the sides.

Eze 42:16 He measured the east side with his measuring rod: a total of five hundred cubits by the measuring
rod.

Eze 42:17 He then measured the north side: a total of five hundred cubits by the measuring rod.

Eze 42:18 He then measured the south side: five hundred cubits by the measuring rod

Eze 42:19 was the total. On the west side he measured five hundred cubits by the measuring rod.

Eze 42:20 He measured the entire enclosing wall on all four sides: length five hundred, breadth five hundred,
separating the sacred from the profane.

Eze 43:1 He took me to the gate, the one facing east.

Eze 43:2 I saw the glory of the God of Israel approaching from the east. A sound came with him like the sound
of the ocean, and the earth shone with his glory.

Eze 43:3 This vision was like the one I had seen when I had come for the destruction of the city, and like the
one I had seen by the River Chebar. Then I fell to the ground.

Eze 43:4 The glory of Yahweh arrived at the Temple by the east gate.

Eze 43:5 The Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court; I saw the glory of Yahweh fill the Temple.
Eze 43:6 And I heard someöne speaking to me from the Temple while the man stood beside me.

Eze 43:7 He said, “Son of man, this is the dais of my throne, the step on which I rest my feet. I shall live here
among the Israelites for ever; and the House of Israel, they and their kings, will never again defile my holy name
with their whorings and the corpses of their kings,

Eze 43:8 by putting their threshold beside my threshold and their doorposts beside my door-posts, with a party
wall shared by them and me. They used to defile my holy name by their loathsome practices, and this is why I
put an end to them in my anger.

Eze 43:9 From now on they will banish their whorings and the corpses of their kings from my presence and I
shall live among them for ever.

Eze 43:10 “Son of man, describe this Temple to the House of Israel, to shame them out of their loathsome
practices. (Let them draw up the plan of it.)

Eze 43:1 1 And, if they are ashamed of their behaviour, show them the design and plan of the Temple, its exits
and entrances, its shape, how all of it is arranged, the entire design and all its principles. Give them all this in
writing so that they can see and take note of its design and the way it is all arranged and carry it out.

Eze 43:12 This is the charter of the Temple: all the surrounding space on the mountain top is an especially holy
area. (Such is the charter of the Temple.)”

Eze 43:13 These were the dimensions of the altar, in cubits each of a cubit plus a handsbreadth. The base: one
cubit high and one cubit wide; the space by the runnel, all round the edge of the altar, one handsbreadth.

Eze 43:14 From the ground level of the base up to the lower plinth, two cubits high and one cubit wide; from the
lesser plinth to the greater plinth, four cubits high and one cubit wide.

Eze 43:15 The altar hearth: four cubits high, with four horns projecting from the hearth,

Eze 43:16 the hearth was four-square: twelve cubits by twelve cubits;

Eze 43:17 and the square plinth: fourteen cubits by fourteen cubits; and the ledge all round: half a cubit; and the
base: one cubit all round. The steps were on the east side.

Eze 43:18 He said to me, “Son of man, the Lord Yahweh says this, ‘As regards the altar, this is how things must
be done when it has been built for the sacrifice of the burnt offering and for the pouring of blood.

Eze 43:19 To the levitical priests — those of the race of Zadok — who approach me to serve me — declares the
Lord Yahweh — you must give a young bull as a sacrifice for sin.

Eze 43:20 You must take some of its blood and put it on the four horns, on the four corners of the plinth and on
the surrounding ledge. In this way you will purify it and make expiation on it.

Eze 43:21 Then take the bull of the sacrifice for sin and burn it in that part of the Temple which is cut off from
the sanctuary.

Eze 43:22 On the second day, you must offer an unblemished he-goat as the sacrifice for sin, and the altar must
be purified again as was done with the bull.

Eze 43:23 When you have finished the purification, you must offer a young, unblemished bull and an



unblemished ram from the flock.

Eze 43:24 You must present them before Yahweh, and the priests will sprinkle salt on them and offer them as
burnt offerings to Yahweh.

Eze 43:25 As a sacrifice for sin, every day for seven days you must offer a he-goat, a bull and an unblemished
ram from the flock.

Eze 43:26 In this way the altar will be expiated and will be purified and inaugurated.

Eze 43:27 At the end of that time, on the eighth day and afterwards, the priest will offer your burnt offerings and
your communion sacrifices on the altar, and I shall look favourably on you — declares the Lord Yahweh’”.

Eze 44: 1 He brought me back to the outer east gate of the sanctuary. It was shut.

Eze 44:2 Yahweh said to me, “This gate will be kept shut. No one may open it or go through it, since Yahweh,
God of Israel, has been through it. And so it must be kept shut.

Eze 44:3 The prince himself, however, may sit there to take his meal in the presence of Yahweh. He must enter
and leave through the porch of the gate”.

Eze 44:4 He led me through the north gate to the front of the Temple. And then I looked; I saw the glory of
Yahweh filling the Temple of Yahweh; and I fell to the ground.

Eze 44:5 Yahweh said to me, “Son of man, pay attention, look carefully and listen closely to everything I explain;
these are all the arrangements of the Temple of Yahweh and all its laws. Be careful about who is admitted to the
Temple and who is excluded from the sanctuary.

Eze 44:6 And say to the rebels of the House of Israel, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: You have gone beyond all
bounds with all your loathsome practices, House of Israel,

Eze 44:7 by admitting aliens, uncircumcised in heart and body, to frequent my sanctuary and profane my
Temple, while offering my food, the fat and the blood, and breaking my covenant with all your loathsome
practices.

Eze 44:8 Instead of maintaining the service of my holy things, you have deputed someöne else to maintain my
service in my sanctuary.

Eze 44:9 The Lord Yahweh says this: No alien, uncircumcised in heart and body, may enter my sanctuary, none
of the aliens living among the Israelites.

Eze 44:10 ‘As regards the Levites who abandoned me when Israel strayed far from me by following its idols,
they must bear the weight of their own sin.

Eze 44:1 1 They must be servants in my sanctuary, responsible for guarding the Temple gates and serving the
Temple. They will kill the burnt offerings and the sacrifice for the people, and hold themselves at the service of
the people.

Eze 44: 1 2 Since they used to be at their service in front of their idols and were an occasion of guilt for the
House of Israel, very well, I stretch out my hand against them — declares the Lord Yahweh — they will bear the
weight of their guilt.

Eze 44:13 They may never approach me again to perform the priestly office in my presence, nor touch my holy
things and my most holy things; they must bear the disgrace of their loathsome practices.

Eze 44:14 I shall give them the responsibility of serving the Temple; I shall make them responsible for serving it
and for everything to be done in it.

Eze 44:15 ‘As regards the levitical priests, the sons of Zadok, who maintained the service of my sanctuary
when the Israelites strayed far from me, they will approach me to serve me; they will stand in my presence to
offer me the fat and blood — declares the Lord Yahweh.

Eze 44:16 They will enter my sanctuary and approach my table to serve me; they will maintain my service.

Eze 44: 1 7 Once they enter the gates of the inner court, they must wear linen vestments; they must wear no
wool when they serve inside the gates of the inner court and in the Temple.

Eze 44:18 They must wear linen caps on their heads and linen breeches on their loins; they may not wear
anything round their waists that makes them sweat.

Eze 44:19 When they go out to the people in the outer court, they must remove the vestments in which they
have performed the liturgy and leave them in the rooms of the Holy Place, and put on other clothes, so as not to
hallow the people with their vestments.

Eze 44:20 They may neither shave their heads nor let their hair grow long, but must cut their hair carefully.

Eze 44:21 No priest may drink wine on the day he enters the inner court.

Eze 44:22 They may not marry widows or divorced women, but only virgins of the race of Israel; they may,
however, marry a widow, if she is the widow of a priest.

Eze 44:23 They must teach my people the difference between what is sacred and what is profane and make
them understand the difference between what is clean and what is unclean.

Eze 44:24 They must be judges in law-suits; they must judge in the spirit of my judgements; they must follow my
laws and ordinances at all my feasts and keep my Sabbaths holy.

Eze 44:25 They may not go near a dead person, in case they become unclean, except in these permissible



cases, that is, for father, mother, daughter, son, brother or unmarried sister.

Eze 44:26 After one of them has been purified, seven days must elapse;

Eze 44:27 then, the day he enters the Holy Place in the inner court to minister in the Holy Place, he must offer
his sacrifice for sin — declares the Lord Yahweh.

Eze 44:28 They may have no heritage; I myself shall be their heritage. You may give them no patrimony in
Israel; I myself shall be their patrimony.

Eze 44:29 Their food must be the oblation, the sacrifice for sin and the sacrifice of reparation. Everything
dedicated by vow in Israel shall be for them.

Eze 44:30 The best of all your first-fruits and of all the dues and of everything you offer, must go to the priests;
and the best of your dough you must also give to the priests, so that a blessing may rest on your house.

Eze 44:31 Priests must not eat the flesh of anything that has died a natural death or been savaged, be it bird or
animal’”.

Eze 45:1 “‘When you draw lots to divide the country by heritage, you must set a sacred portion of the country
aside for Yahweh: twenty-five thousand cubits long and twenty thousand wide. The whole of this land must be
sacred,

Eze 45:2 and of this an area five hundred by five hundred cubits must be for the sanctuary, with a boundary fifty
cubits wide right round.

Eze 45:3 Out of this area you must also measure a section twenty-five thousand by ten thousand cubits, in
which will be the sanctuary, the Holy of Holies.

Eze 45:4 This will be the sacred portion of the country, belonging to the priests who officiate in the sanctuary
and approach Yahweh to serve him. It will contain room for their houses and room for the sanctuary.

Eze 45:5 A portion twenty-five thousand by ten thousand cubits will be owned by the Levites serving the
Temple, with towns for them to live in.

Eze 45:6 You must give the city possession of an area five thousand by twenty-five thousand cubits, near the
land belonging to the sanctuary; this must be for the whole House of Israel.

Eze 45:7 ‘The prince must have a territory either side of the sacred portion and of the property of the city,
adjacent to the sacred portion and the property of the city, stretching westwards from the west and eastwards
from the east, its size equal to one of the portions between the west and the east frontiers
Eze 45:8 of the country. This will be his property in Israel. Then my princes will no longer oppress my people;
they must leave the rest of the country for the House of Israel, for its tribes.

Eze 45:9 ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Enough, princes of Israel! Give up your violence and plundering, do what
is upright and just, stop crushing my people with taxation — declares the Lord Yahweh.

Eze 45:10 Have fair scales, a fair <i>ephah</i>, a fair bat.

Eze 45:1 1 Let the <i>ephah</i> and bat be equal, let the bat hold one-tenth of a <i>homer</i> and the <i>ephah</i> one-tenth of a
<i>homer</i>. Let the measures be based on the <i>homer</i>.

Eze 45:12 The shekel must be twenty <i>gerah</i>. Twenty shekels, twenty-five shekels and fifteen shekels must
make one mina.

Eze 45:13 ‘This is the offering that you must levy: the sixth of an <i>ephah</i> for every <i>homer</i> of wheat, and the sixth
of an <i>ephah</i> for every <i>homer</i> of barley.

Eze 45:14 The dues on oil: one bat of oil out of every ten bat or out of every <i>kor</i> (which is equal to ten bat or one
<i>homer</i>, since ten bat equal one <i>homer</i>).

Eze 45:15 You must levy one sheep on every flock of two hundred from the pastures of Israel for the oblation,
the burnt offerings and the communion sacrifice. This must form your expiation — declares the Lord Yahweh.

Eze 45:16 Let all the people of the country be subject to this due for the prince of Israel.

Eze 45:17 The prince must make himself responsible for providing the burnt offerings, the oblation and the
libations for feasts, New Moons, Sabbaths and all the solemn festivals of the House of Israel. He must provide
the sacrifice for sin, the oblation, the burnt offerings and the communion sacrifices to make expiation for the
House of Israel.

Eze 45:18 ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: On the first day of the first month, you must take a young bull without
blemish, to purify the sanctuary.

Eze 45:19 The priest must take blood from the sacrifice for sin and put it on the doorposts of the Temple, on the
four corners of the altar plinth and on the doorposts of the gates of the inner court.

Eze 45:20 You must do the same on the seventh of the month, on behalf of anyone who has sinned through
inadvertence or ignorance. This is how you must make expiation for the Temple.

Eze 45:21 On the fourteenth day of the first month, you must celebrate the feast of the Passover. For seven
days everyone must eat unleavened loaves.

Eze 45:22 On that day, the prince must offer a bull as a sacrifice for sin, for himself and all the people of the
country.

Eze 45:23 For the seven days of the feast, he must offer Yahweh burnt offerings of seven bulls and seven rams



without blemish, daily for a week, and one he-goat daily as a sacrifice for sin,

Eze 45:24 and as an oblation, one <i>ephah</i> for each bull and one <i>ephah</i> for each ram, and a <i>hin</i> of oil for every
<i>ephah</i>.

Eze 45:25 ‘For the feast that falls on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, he must do the same for seven
days, offering the sacrifice for sin, the burnt offerings, the oblation and the oil’”.

Eze 46:1 “‘The Lord Yahweh says this: The east gate of the inner court must be kept shut for the six working
days. On the Sabbath day, however, it must be opened, as also on the day of the New Moon;

Eze 46:2 and the prince must go in through the porch of the outer gate and take his position by the doorposts of
the gate. The priests must then offer his burnt offerings and his communion sacrifice. He must prostrate himself
on the threshold of the gate and go out, and the gate must not be shut again until the evening.

Eze 46:3 The people of the country must prostrate themselves in the presence of Yahweh at the entrance to the
gate on Sabbaths and days of the New Moon.

Eze 46:4 The burnt offering offered to Yahweh by the prince on the Sabbath day must consist of six
unblemished lambs and one unblemished ram,

Eze 46:5 with an oblation of one <i>ephah</i> for the ram, and such oblation as he pleases for the lambs, and a <i>hin</i> of
oil for every <i>ephah</i>.

Eze 46:6 On the day of the New Moon it must consist of an unblemished young bull, six unblemished lambs and
one unblemished ram,

Eze 46:7 when he must make an oblation of one <i>ephah</i> for the bull and one <i>ephah</i> for the ram, and what he
pleases for the lambs, and a <i>hin</i> of oil for every <i>ephah</i>.

Eze 46:8 ‘When the prince goes in, he must enter by the porch of the gate, and he must leave by the same way.
Eze 46:9 When the people of the country come into the presence of Yahweh at the solemn festivals, those who
have come in by the north gate to prostrate themselves must go out by the south gate, and those who have
come in by the south gate must go out by the north gate; no one must turn back to leave through the gate by
which he entered but must go out on the opposite side.

Eze 46:10 The prince will be with them, coming in like them and going out like them.

Eze 46:1 1 ‘On feast days and solemn festivals the oblation must be one <i>ephah</i> for every bull, one <i>ephah</i> for
every ram, what he pleases for the lambs, and a <i>hin</i> of oil for every <i>ephah</i>.

Eze 46:12 When the prince offers Yahweh voluntary burnt offerings or a voluntary communion sacrifice, the east
gate must be opened for him, and he must offer his burnt offerings and his communion sacrifice as he does on
the Sabbath day; when he has gone out, the gate must be shut after him.

Eze 46:13 Every day he must offer an unblemished lamb one year old as a burnt offering to Yahweh; he must
offer this every morning.

Eze 46:14 Every morning in addition he must offer an oblation of one-sixth of an <i>ephah</i> and one-third of a <i>hin</i> of
oil, for mixing with the flour. This is the oblation to Yahweh, a perpetual decree, fixed for ever.

Eze 46:15 The lamb, the oblation and the oil must be offered morning after morning for ever.

Eze 46:16 ‘Lord Yahweh says this: If the prince presents part of his hereditary portion to one of his sons, the gift
must pass into the ownership of his sons and become their hereditary property.

Eze 46:17 If, however, he presents part of his hereditary portion to one of his slaves, it will belong to the man
only until the year of liberation and then must revert to the prince. Only his sons may retain his hereditary
portion.

Eze 46:18 The prince may not take any part of the people’s hereditary portion, thus robbing them of what is
theirs; he must provide the patrimony of his sons out of his own property, so that no member of my people is
robbed of what is his!’”.

Eze 46:19 He took me through the entrance at the side of the north gate that leads to the rooms of the Holy
Place set apart for the priests. And there before us, to the west, was a space at the end.

Eze 46:20 He said to me, This is where the priests must boil the slaughtered animals for the sacrifice for sin
and the sacrifice of reparation, and where they must bake the oblation, without having to carry them into the
outer court and so run the risk of hallowing the people”.

Eze 46:21 He then took me into the outer court and led me to each of its four corners; in each corner of the
outer court was a compound;

Eze 46:22 in other words, the four corners of the court contained four small compounds, forty cubits by thirty, all
four being the same size.

Eze 46:23 All four were enclosed by a wall, with hearths all round the bottom of the wall.

Eze 46:24 He said, “These are the kitchens where the Temple servants must boil the sacrifices offered by the
people”.

Eze 47:1 He brought me back to the entrance of the Temple, where a stream flowed eastwards from under the
Temple threshold, for the Temple faced east. The water flowed from under the right side of the Temple, south of
the altar.



Eze 47:2 He took me out by the north gate and led me right round outside as far as the outer east gate where
the water flowed out on the right-hand side.

Eze 47:3 The man went off to the east holding his measuring line and measured off a thousand cubits; he then
made me wade across the stream; the water reached my ankles.

Eze 47:4 He measured off another thousand and made me wade across the stream again; the water reached
my knees. He measured off another thousand and made me wade across the stream again; the water reached
my waist.

Eze 47:5 He measured off another thousand; it was now a river which I could not cross; the stream had swollen
and was now deep water, a river impossible to cross.

Eze 47:6 He then said, “Do you see, son of man?”. He then took me and brought me back to the bank on the
river.

Eze 47:7 Now, when I reached it, I saw an enormous number of trees on each bank of the river.

Eze 47:8 He said, “This water flows east down to the Arabah and to the sea; and flowing into the sea it makes
its waters wholesome.

Eze 47:9 Wherever the river flows, all living creatures teeming in it will live. Fish will be very plentiful, for
wherever the water goes it brings health, and life teems wherever the river flows.

Eze 47:10 There will be fishermen on its banks. Fishing nets will be spread from En-Gedi to En-Eglaim. The
species of fish will be the same as the fish of the Great Sea.

Eze 47:1 1 The marshes and lagoons, however, will not become wholesome, but will remain salt.

Eze 47:12 Along the river, on either bank, will grow every kind of fruit tree with leaves that never wither and fruit
that never fails; they will bear new fruit every month, because this water comes from the sanctuary. And their
fruit will be good to eat and the leaves medicinal”.

Eze 47:13 “The Lord Yahweh says this, ‘This will be the territory which you must distribute among the twelve
tribes of Israel, with two portions for Joseph.

Eze 47:14 You will each have a fair share of it, since I swore to your fathers that I would give it to them, and this
country now falls to you as your heritage.

Eze 47:15 These will be the frontiers of the country. On the north, from the Great Sea, the road from Hethlon to
the Pass of Hamath, Zedad,

Eze 47:16 Berothah, Sibraim lying between the territories of Damascus and Hamath, to Hazer-ha-Tikon on the
borders of Hauran;

Eze 47:17 the frontier will extend from the sea to Hazer-Enon, with the territory of Damascus and the territory of
Hamath to the north; that will be the northern frontier.

Eze 47:18 On the east, the Jordan will serve as frontier between Hauran and Damascus, between Gilead and
Israel, down to the Eastern Sea as far as Tamar; that will be the eastern frontier.

Eze 47:19 On the south, from Tamar southward to the Waters of Meribah in Kadesh, to the Wadi and the Great
Sea; that will be the southern frontier.

Eze 47:20 And to the west, the Great Sea will serve as frontier up to the point opposite the Pass of Hamath; that
will be the western frontier.

Eze 47:21 You must distribute this country among yourselves, among the tribes of Israel.

Eze 47:22 You must distribute it as a heritage for yourselves and the aliens settled among you who have
fathered children among you, since you must treat them as citizens of Israel. They must draw lots for their
heritage with you, among the tribes of Israel.

Eze 47:23 You will give the alien his heritage in the tribe where he has settled — declares the Lord Yahweh.” “
Eze 48:1 “‘This is the list of the tribes. One portion in the far north by way of Hethlon to the Pass of Hamath, to
Hazer-Enon, with the territory of Damascus to the north, and marching with Hamath, from the eastern limit to the
western limit: Dan.

Eze 48:2 One portion bordering Dan, from the eastern limit to the western limit: Asher.

Eze 48:3 One portion bordering Asher, from the eastern limit to the western limit: Naphtali.

Eze 48:4 One portion bordering Naphtali, from the eastern limit to the western limit: Manasseh.

Eze 48:5 One portion bordering Manasseh, from the eastern limit to the western limit: Ephraim.

Eze 48:6 One portion bordering Ephraim, from the eastern limit to the western limit: Reuben.

Eze 48:7 One portion bordering Reuben, from the eastern limit to the western limit: Judah.

Eze 48:8 One portion bordering Judah, from the eastern limit to the western limit, is the portion which you must
set aside, twenty-five thousand cubits wide, and as long as each of the other portions from the eastern limit to
the western limit. The sanctuary will be in the centre of it.

Eze 48:9 ‘The portion which you must set aside for Yahweh must be twenty-five thousand cubits long and ten
thousand cubits wide.

Eze 48:10 This sacred portion must belong to the priests, being, on the north side, twenty-five thousand cubits;
on the west side ten thousand cubits wide, on the east side ten thousand cubits wide and on the south side



twenty-five thousand cubits long; the sanctuary of Yahweh will be in the centre of it.

Eze 48:1 1 This will be for the consecrated priests, those of the sons of Zadok who maintained my liturgy and did
not go astray with the straying Israelites, as the Levites went astray.

Eze 48:12 And so their portion must be taken out of the especially holy portion of the land, near the territory of
the Levites.

Eze 48:13 The territory of the Levites, like the territory of the priests, must be twenty-five thousand cubits long
and ten thousand wide — the whole length being twenty-five thousand and the width ten thousand.

Eze 48:14 It will be illegal for them to sell or exchange any part of it, and the domain can never be alienated,
since it is consecrated to Yahweh.

Eze 48:15 As regards the remainder, an area of five thousand cubits by twenty-five thousand, this must be for
the common use of the city, for houses and pastures. In the middle will be the city.

Eze 48:16 These will be its dimensions: on the north side, four thousand five hundred cubits; on the south side,
four thousand five hundred cubits; on the east side, four thousand five hundred cubits; on the west side, four
thousand five hundred cubits.

Eze 48:17 The pasture land of the city must extend two hundred and fifty cubits to the north, two hundred and
fifty to the south, two hundred and fifty to the east, two hundred and fifty to the west.

Eze 48:18 One strip, contiguous to the sacred portion, must be left over, consisting often thousand cubits to
eastward and ten thousand to westward, marching with the sacred portion; this will bring in a revenue for feeding
the municipal workmen.

Eze 48:19 And the municipal workmen, drawn from all the tribes of Israel, will farm it.

Eze 48:20 The portion must have a total area of twenty-five thousand cubits by twenty-five thousand. You must
allocate a square area from the sacred portion to constitute the city.

Eze 48:21 What is left over will be for the prince, on either side of the sacred portion and of the property of the
city, marching with the twenty-five thousand cubits to eastward to the eastern frontier, and marching with the
twenty-five thousand cubits to westward to the western frontier — running parallel with the other portions and
belonging to the prince. In the centre will be the sacred portion and the sanctuary of the Temple.

Eze 48:22 Thus, apart from the property of the Levites and the property of the city which lie in the middle of the
prince’s portion, everything between the borders of Judah and the borders of Ben- jamin must belong to the
prince.

Eze 48:23 ‘As regards the rest of the tribes: One portion from the eastern limit to the western limit: Benjamin.
Eze 48:24 One portion bordering Benjamin, from the eastern limit to the western limit: Simeon.

Eze 48:25 One portion bordering Simeon, from the eastern limit to the western limit: Issachar.

Eze 48:26 One portion bordering Issachar, from the eastern limit to the western limit: Zebulun.

Eze 48:27 One portion bordering Zebulun, from the eastern limit to the western limit: Gad.

Eze 48:28 On the southern border of Gad, on the south side, the border will run from Tamar to the Waters of
Meribah in Kadesh, to the Wadi and the Great Sea.

Eze 48:29 This is how you must distribute the country to the tribes of Israel as their heritage, and these must be
their portions — declares the Lord Yahweh.

Eze 48:30 ‘Here are the exits from the city. On the north side, four thousand five hundred cubits are to be
measured off.

Eze 48:31 The gates of the city are to be named after the tribes of Israel. Three gates to the north: one the gate
of Reuben; one the gate of Judah; one the gate of Levi.

Eze 48:32 On the east side, there will be four thousand five hundred cubits and three gates: one the gate of
Joseph; one the gate of Benjamin; one the gate of Dan.

Eze 48:33 On the south side, four thousand five hundred cubits are to be measured off, and there are to be
three gates: one the gate of Simeon; one the gate of Issachar; one the gate of Zebulun.

Eze 48:34 On the west side, there will be four thousand five hundred cubits and three gates: one the gate of
Gad; one the gate of Asher; one the gate of Naphtali.

Eze 48:35 Total perimeter: eighteen thousand cubits. ‘The name of the city in future must be: Yahweh-is-there’.

Dan 1:1 In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched on
Jerusalem and besieged it.

Dan 1 :2 The Lord let Jehoiakim king of Judah fall into his power, as well as some of the vessels belonging to the
Temple of God. These he took away to Shinar, putting the vessels into the treasury of his own gods.

Dan 1 :3 From the Israelites, the king ordered Ashpenaz, his chief eunuch, to bring a certain number of boys of
royal or noble descent;

Dan 1:4 they had to be without any physical defect, of good appearance, versed in every branch of wisdom,
well-informed, discerning, suitable for service at the royal court. Ashpenaz was to teach them to speak and write
the language of the Chaldaeans.



Dan 1:5 The king assigned them a daily allowance of food and wine from the royal table. They were to receive
an education lasting for three years, after which they would enter the royal service.

Dan 1:6 Among them were the Judaeans Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah.

Dan 1:7 The chief eunuch gave them other names, calling Daniel Belteshazzar, Hananiah Shadrach, Mishael
Meshach, and Azariah Abed-Nego.

Dan 1 :8 Daniel, who was determined not to incur pollution by food and wine from the royal table, begged the
chief eunuch to spare him this defilement.

Dan 1 :9 God allowed Daniel to receive faithful love and sympathy from the chief eunuch.

Dan 1:10 But the eunuch warned Daniel, “I am afraid of my lord the king: he has assigned you food and drink,
and if he sees you looking thinner in the face than the other boys of your age, my head will be in danger with the
king because of you”.

Dan 1:11 To the guard assigned to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah by the chief eunuch, Daniel then
said,

Dan 1:12 “Please allow your servants a ten days’ trial, during which we are given only vegetables to eat and
water to drink.

Dan 1:13 You can then compare our looks with those of the boys who eat the king’s food; go by what you see,
and treat your servants accordingly”.

Dan 1:14 The man agreed to do what they asked and put them on ten days’ trial.

Dan 1:15 When the ten days were over, they looked better and fatter than any of the boys who had eaten their
allowance from the royal table;

Dan 1:16 so the guard withdrew their allowance of food and the wine they were to drink, and gave them
vegetables.

Dan 1:17 To these four boys God gave knowledge and skill in every aspect of literature and learning; Daniel
also had the gift of interpreting every kind of vision and dream.

Dan 1:18 When the time stipulated by the king for the boys to be presented to him came round, the chief
eunuch presented them to Nebuchadnezzar.

Dan 1:19 The king conversed with them, and among all the boys found none to equal Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael
and Azariah. So they became members of the king’s court,

Dan 1 :20 and on whatever point of wisdom or understanding he might question them, he found them ten times
better than all the magicians and soothsayers in his entire kingdom. Daniel remained there until the first year of
King Cyrus.

Dan 2:1 In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had a series of dreams; he was perturbed by this and
sleep deserted him.

Dan 2:2 The king then had magicians and soothsayers, sorcerers and Chaldaeans summoned to tell him what
his dreams meant. They arrived and stood in the king’s presence.

Dan 2:3 The king said to them, “I have had a dream, and my mind is troubled by a wish to understand it”.

Dan 2:4 The Chaldaeans answered the king: “May your majesty live for ever! Tell your servants the dream, and
we shall reveal its meaning for you”.

Dan 2:5 The king answered the Chaldaeans, “This is my firm resolve: if you cannot tell me what I dreamt and
what it means, I shall have you torn limb from limb and your houses turned into dunghills.

Dan 2:6 If, on the other hand, you can tell me what I dreamt and what it means, I shall give you presents,
rewards and high honour. So tell me what I dreamt and what it means”.

Dan 2:7 A second time they said, “Let the king tell his dream to his servants, and we shall reveal its meaning”.
Dan 2:8 But the king retorted, “It is plain to me that you are trying to gain time, knowing my proclaimed resolve.
Dan 2:9 If you do not interpret my dream for me, there will be but one sentence passed on you all; you have
agreed among yourselves to make me misleading and tortuous speeches while the time goes by. So tell me
what my dream was, and then I shall know whether you can interpret it”.

Dan 2:10 The Chaldaeans answered the king, “Nobody in the world could explain the king’s problem; what is
more, no other king, governor or chief would think of putting such a question to any magician, soothsayer or
Chaldaean.

Dan 2:1 1 The question the king asks is difficult, and no one can find the king an answer to it, except the gods,
whose dwelling is not with mortals”.

Dan 2:12 At this the king flew into a rage and ordered all the Babylonian sages to be put to death.

Dan 2:13 On publication of the decree to have the sages killed, search was made for Daniel and his
companions to have them put to death.

Dan 2:14 Then, with shrewd and cautious words, Daniel approached Arioch, the king’s chief executioner, when
he was on his way to kill the Babylonian sages.

Dan 2:15 To this royal official Arioch he said, “Why has the king issued such a harsh decree?”. Arioch explained
matters to Daniel,



Dan 2:16 and Daniel went off to ask the king for a stay of execution to give him the opportunity of revealing his
interpretation to the king.

Dan 2:17 Daniel then went home and told his friends Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah what had happened,

Dan 2:18 urging them to beg the God of heaven to show his mercy and explain the mysterious secret, so that
Daniel and his friends might be spared the fate of the other Babylonian sages.

Dan 2:19 The mystery was then revealed to Daniel in a night-vision, and Daniel blessed the God of heaven.

Dan 2:20 This is what Daniel said: May the name of God be blessed for ever and ever, since wisdom and power
are his alone.

Dan 2:21 It is he who controls the procession of times and seasons, who makes and unmakes kings, who
confers wisdom on the wise, and knowledge on those with discernment,

Dan 2:22 who uncovers depths and mysteries, who knows what lies in darkness; and light dwells with him.

Dan 2:23 To you, God of my fathers, I give thanks and praise for having given me wisdom and strength: to me
you have explained what we asked you, to us you have explained the king’s problem.

Dan 2:24 So Daniel went to see Arioch, whom the king had made responsible for putting the Babylonian sages
to death. Going in, he said, “Do not put the Babylonian sages to death. Take me into the king’s presence and I
will reveal the meaning to the king”.

Dan 2:25 Arioch lost no time in bringing Daniel to the king. “Among the exiles from Judah”, he said, “I have
discovered a man who can reveal the meaning to the king”.

Dan 2:26 The king said to Daniel (who had been given the name Belteshazzar), “Can you tell me what I dreamt
and what it means?”.

Dan 2:27 Facing the king, Daniel replied, “None of the sages, soothsayers, magicians or exorcists has been
able to tell the king the truth of the mystery which the king has propounded;

Dan 2:28 but there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries and who has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what
is to take place in the final days. These, then, are the dream and the visions that passed through your head as
you lay in bed:

Dan 2:29 “Your Majesty, on your bed your thoughts turned to what would happen in the future, and the Revealer
of Mysteries disclosed to you what is to take place.

Dan 2:30 This mystery has been revealed to me, not that I am wiser than anyone else, but for this sole purpose:
that the king should learn what it means, and that you should understand your inmost thoughts.

Dan 2:31 “You have had a vision, Your Majesty; this is what you saw: a statue, a great statue of extreme
brightness, stood before you, terrible to see.

Dan 2:32 The head of this statue was of fine gold, its chest and arms were of silver, its belly and thighs of
bronze,

Dan 2:33 its legs of iron, its feet part iron, part clay.

Dan 2:34 While you were gazing, a stone broke away, untouched by any hand, and struck the statue, struck its
feet of iron and clay and shattered them.

Dan 2:35 Then, iron and clay, bronze, silver and gold, all broke into pieces as fine as chaff on the threshing-floor
in summer. The wind blew them away, leaving not a trace behind. And the stone that had struck the statue grew
into a great mountain, filling the whole world.

Dan 2:36 This was the dream; we shall now explain to the king what it means.

Dan 2:37 “You, Your Majesty, king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given sovereignty, power, strength
and honour-

Dan 2:38 human beings, wild animals, birds of the air, wherever they live, he has entrusted to your rule, making
you king of them all — you are the golden head.

Dan 2:39 And, after you, another kingdom will rise, not as great as yours, and then a third, of bronze, which will
rule the whole world.

Dan 2:40 There will be a fourth kingdom, hard as iron, as iron that pulverises and crushes all. Like iron that
breaks everything to pieces, it will crush and break all the earlier kingdoms.

Dan 2:41 The feet you saw, part earthenware, part iron, are a kingdom which will be split in two, but which will
retain something of the strength of iron, just as you saw the iron and the clay of the earthenware mixed together.
Dan 2:42 The feet were part iron, part potter’s clay: the kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle.

Dan 2:43 And just as you saw the iron and the clay of the earthenware mixed together, so the two will be mixed
together in human seed; but they will not hold together any more than iron will blend with clay.

Dan 2:44 In the days of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom which will never be destroyed, and
this kingdom will not pass into the hands of another race: it will shatter and absorb all the previous kingdoms and
itself last for ever-

Dan 2:45 just as you saw a stone, untouched by hand, break away from the mountain and reduce iron, bronze,
earthenware, silver and gold to powder. The Great God has shown the king what is to take place. The dream is
true, the interpretation exact”.



Dan 2:46 At this, King Nebuchadnezzar fell prostrate before Daniel; he gave orders for Daniel to be offered an
oblation and a fragrant sacrifice.

Dan 2:47 The king said to Daniel, “Your god is indeed the God of gods, the Master of kings, and the Revealer of
Mysteries, since you have been able to reveal this mystery”.

Dan 2:48 The king then conferred high rank on Daniel and gave him many handsome presents. He also made
him governor of the whole province of Babylon and head of all the sages of Babylon.

Dan 2:49 At Daniel’s request, the king entrusted the affairs of the province of Babylon to Shadrach, Meshach
and Abed-Nego; Daniel himself remained in attendance on the king.

Dan 3:1 King Nebuchadnezzar had a golden statue made, sixty cubits high and six cubits wide, which he set up
on the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.

Dan 3:2 King Nebuchadnezzar then summoned the satraps, magistrates, governors, counsellors, treasurers,
judges, lawyers, and all the provincial authorities to assemble and attend the dedication of the statue set up by
King Nebuchadnezzar.

Dan 3:3 Satraps, magistrates, governors, counsellors, treasurers, judges, lawyers and all the provincial
authorities then assembled for the dedication of the statue set up by King Nebuchadnezzar and stood in front of
the statue which King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.

Dan 3:4 A herald then loudly proclaimed: “Peoples, nations, languages! Thus are you commanded:

Dan 3:5 the moment you hear the sound of horn, pipe, lyre, zither, harp, bagpipe and every other kind of
instrument, you will prostrate yourselves and worship the golden statue set up by King Nebuchadnezzar.

Dan 3:6 Anyone who does not prostrate himself and worship will immediately be thrown into the burning fiery
furnace”.

Dan 3:7 And so, the instant all the peoples heard the sound of horn, pipe, lyre, zither, harp, bagpipe and all the
other instruments, all the peoples, nations and languages prostrated themselves and worshipped the statue set
up by King Nebuchadnezzar.

Dan 3:8 Some Chaldaeans then came forward and maliciously accused the Jews.

Dan 3:9 They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, “May Your Majesty live for ever!

Dan 3:10 You have issued a decree, Your Majesty, to the effect that everyone on hearing the sound of horn,
pipe, lyre, zither, harp, bagpipe and every other kind of instrument is to prostrate himself and worship the golden
statue;

Dan 3:1 1 and that anyone who does not prostrate himself and worship is to be thrown into the burning fiery
furnace.

Dan 3:12 Now, there are certain Jews to whom you have entrusted the affairs of the province of Babylon:
Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego; these men have ignored your command, Your Majesty; they do not serve
your gods, and refuse to worship the golden statue you have set up”.

Dan 3:13 Shaking with fury, Nebuchadnezzar sent for Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego. The men were
immediately brought before the king.

Dan 3:14 Nebuchadnezzar addressed them, “Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego, is it true that you do not
serve my gods, and that you refuse to worship the golden statue I have set up?

Dan 3:15 When you hear the sound of horn, pipe, lyre, zither, harp, bagpipe and every other kind of instrument,
are you prepared to prostrate yourselves and worship the statue I have made? If you refuse to worship it, you
will be thrown forthwith into the burning fiery furnace; then which of the gods could save you from my power?”.
Dan 3:16 Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego replied to King Nebuchadnezzar, “Your question needs no
answer from us:

Dan 3:17 if our God, the one we serve, is able to save us from the burning fiery furnace and from your power,
Your Majesty, he will save us;

Dan 3:18 and even if he does not, then you must know, Your Majesty, that we will not serve your god or worship
the statue you have set up”.

Dan 3:19 This infuriated King Nebuchadnezzar; his expression was changed now as he looked at Shadrach,
Meshach and Abed-Nego. He gave orders for the furnace to be made seven times hotter than usual
Dan 3:20 and commanded certain stalwarts from his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego and
throw them into the burning fiery furnace.

Dan 3:21 They were then bound in their cloaks, trousers, headgear and other garments, and thrown into the
burning fiery furnace.

Dan 3:22 The king’s command was so urgent and the heat of the furnace was so fierce, that the men carrying
Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego were burnt to death by the flames from the fire;

Dan 3:23 the three men, Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego fell, bound, into the burning fiery furnace.

Dan 3:24 And they walked in the heart of the flames, praising God and blessing the Lord.

Dan 3:25 Azariah stood in the heart of the fire, praying aloud thus:

Dan 3:26 May you be blessed and revered, Lord, God of our ancestors, may your name be held glorious for



ever.

Dan 3:27 For you are upright in all that you have done for us, all your deeds are true, all your ways right, all your
judgements true.

Dan 3:28 True is the sentence you have given in all that you have brought down on us and on Jerusalem, the
holy city of our ancestors, for you have treated us rightly and truly, as our sins deserve.

Dan 3:29 Yes, we have sinned and committed a crime by deserting you, yes, we have greatly sinned; we have
not listened to your commandments,

Dan 3:30 we have not observed them, we have not done what you commanded us to do for our own good.

Dan 3:31 Yes, all that you have brought down on us, all that you have done to us, you have been fully justified
in doing.

Dan 3:32 You have handed us over to our enemies, to a lawless people, the worst of the godless, to an unjust
king, the worst in the whole world;

Dan 3:33 today we have no right to open our mouths, shame and dishonour are the lot of those who serve and
worship you.

Dan 3:34 Do not abandon us for ever, for the sake of your name; do not repudiate your covenant,

Dan 3:35 do not withdraw your favour from us, for the sake of Abraham, your friend, of Isaac, your servant, and
of Israel, your holy one,

Dan 3:36 to whom you promised to make their descendants as many as the stars of heaven and as the grains
of sand on the seashore.

Dan 3:37 Lord, we have become the least of all nations, we are put to shame today throughout the world,
because of our sins.

Dan 3:38 We now have no leader, no prophet, no prince, no burnt offering, no sacrifice, no oblation, no incense,
no place where we can make offerings to you

Dan 3:39 and win your favour. But may the contrite soul, the humbled spirit, be as acceptable to you
Dan 3:40 as burnt offerings of rams and bullocks, as thousands of fat lambs: such let our sacrifice be to you
today, and may it please you that we follow you whole-heartedly, since those who trust in you will not be
shamed.

Dan 3:41 And now we put our whole heart into following you, into fearing you and seeking your face once more.
Dan 3:42 Do not abandon us to shame but treat us in accordance with your gentleness, in accordance with the
greatness of your mercy.

Dan 3:43 Rescue us in accordance with your wonderful deeds and win fresh glory for your name, O Lord.

Dan 3:44 Confusion seize all who ill-treat your servants: may they be covered with shame, deprived of all their
power, and may their strength be broken.

Dan 3:45 Let them learn that you alone are God and Lord, glorious over the whole world.

Dan 3:46 All this time, the king’s servants, who had thrown them into the furnace, had been stoking it with crude
oil, pitch, tow and brushwood

Dan 3:47 until the flames rose forty-nine cubits above the furnace

Dan 3:48 and, leaping out, burnt those Chaldaeans to death who were standing round it.

Dan 3:49 But the angel of the Lord came down into the furnace beside Azariah and his companions; he drove
the flames of the fire outwards from the furnace

Dan 3:50 and, in the heart of the furnace, wafted a coolness to them as of the breeze and dew, so that the fire
did not touch them at all and caused them no pain or distress.

Dan 3:51 Then all three in unison began to sing, glorifying and blessing God in the furnace, with the words:

Dan 3:52 May you be blessed, Lord, God of our ancestors, be praised and extolled for ever. Blessed be your
glorious and holy name, praised and extolled for ever.

Dan 3:53 May you be blessed in the Temple of your sacred glory, exalted and glorified above all for ever:

Dan 3:54 blessed on the throne of your kingdom, exalted above all, glorified for ever:

Dan 3:55 blessed are you who fathom the abyss, enthroned on the winged creatures, praised and exalted
above all for ever:

Dan 3:56 blessed in the expanse of the heavens, exalted and glorified for ever.

Dan 3:57 Bless the Lord, all the Lord’s creation: praise and glorify him for ever!

Dan 3:58 Bless the Lord, angels of the Lord, praise and glorify him for ever!

Dan 3:59 Bless the Lord, heavens, praise and glorify him for ever!

Dan 3:60 Bless the Lord, all the waters above the heavens, praise and glorify him for ever!

Dan 3:61 Bless the Lord, powers of the Lord, praise and glorify him for ever!

Dan 3:62 Bless the Lord, sun and moon, praise and glorify him for ever!

Dan 3:63 Bless the Lord, stars of heaven, praise and glorify him for ever!

Dan 3:64 Bless the Lord, all rain and dew, praise and glorify him for ever!

Dan 3:65 Bless the Lord, every wind, praise and glorify him for ever!



Dan 3:66 Bless the Lord, fire and heat, praise and glorify him for ever!

Dan 3:67 Bless the Lord, cold and warmth, praise and glorify him for ever!

Dan 3:68 Bless the Lord, dew and snow-storm, praise and glorify him for ever!

Dan 3:69 Bless the Lord, frost and cold, praise and glorify him for ever!

Dan 3:70 Bless the Lord, ice and snow, praise and glorify him for ever!

Dan 3:71 Bless the Lord, nights and days, praise and glorify him for ever!

Dan 3:72 Bless the Lord, light and darkness, praise and glorify him for ever!

Dan 3:73 Bless the Lord, lightning and cloud, praise and glorify him for ever!

Dan 3:74 Let the earth bless the Lord: praise and glorify him for ever!

Dan 3:75 Bless the Lord, mountains and hills, praise and glorify him for ever!

Dan 3:76 Bless the Lord, every plant that grows, praise and glorify him for ever!

Dan 3:77 Bless the Lord, springs of water, praise and glorify him for ever!

Dan 3:78 Bless the Lord, seas and rivers, praise and glorify him for ever!

Dan 3:79 Bless the Lord, whales, and everything that moves in the waters, praise and glorify him for ever!

Dan 3:80 Bless the Lord, every kind of bird, praise and glorify him for ever!

Dan 3:81 Bless the Lord, all animals wild and tame, praise and glorify him for ever!

Dan 3:82 Bless the Lord, all the human race: praise and glorify him for ever!

Dan 3:83 Bless the Lord, O Israel, praise and glorify him for ever!

Dan 3:84 Bless the Lord, priests, praise and glorify him for ever!

Dan 3:85 Bless the Lord, his servants, praise and glorify him for ever!

Dan 3:86 Bless the Lord, spirits and souls of the upright, praise and glorify him for ever!

Dan 3:87 Bless the Lord, faithful, humble-hearted people, praise and glorify him for ever!

Dan 3:88 Hananiah, Azariah and Mishael, bless the Lord, praise and glorify him for ever!-For he has rescued us

from the Underworld, he has saved us from the hand of Death, he has snatched us from the burning fiery
furnace, he has drawn us from the heart of the flame!

Dan 3:89 Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good, for his love is everlasting.

Dan 3:90 Bless the Lord, the God of gods, all who fear him, give praise and thanks to him, for his love is
everlasting!

Dan 3:91 King Nebuchadnezzar sprang to his feet in amazement. He said to his advisers, “Did we not have
these three men thrown bound into the fire?”. They answered the king, “Certainly, Your Majesty'.

Dan 3:92 “But”, he went on, “I can see four men walking free in the heart of the fire and quite unharmed! And the
fourth looks like a child of the gods!”.

Dan 3:93 Nebuchadnezzar approached the mouth of the burning fiery furnace and said, “Shadrach, Meshach
and Abed-Nego, servants of God Most High, come out, come here!”. And from the heart of the fire out came
Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego.

Dan 3:94 The satraps, magistrates, governors, and advisers of the king crowded round the three men to
examine them: the fire had had no effect on their bodies: not a hair of their heads had been singed, their cloaks
were not scorched, no smell of burning hung about them. Nebuchadnezzar said,

Dan 3:95 “Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego: he has sent his angel to rescue his
servants who, putting their trust in him, defied the order of the king, and preferred to forfeit their bodies rather
than serve or worship any god but their God.

Dan 3:96 I therefore decree as follows, ‘Peoples, nations, and languages! Let any of you speak disrespectfully
of the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego, and I shall have him torn limb from limb and his house turned
into a dunghill; for there is no other god who can save like this’”.

Dan 3:97 The king then showered favours on Shadrach, Meshach and Abed-Nego in the province of Babylon.
Dan 3:98 “King Nebuchadnezzar, to all peoples, nations and languages dwelling throughout the world: may you
prosper more and more!

Dan 3:99 “It is my pleasure to make known the signs and wonders with which the Most High God has favoured
me.

Dan 3:100 How great his signs, how mighty his wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, his empire
endures age after age!”.

Dan 4:1 “I, Nebuchadnezzar, was living comfortably in my house, prosperously in my palace.

Dan 4:2 I had a dream; it appalled me. Dread assailed me as I lay in bed; the visions that passed through my
head tormented me.

Dan 4:3 So I decreed that all the sages of Babylon be summoned to explain to me what the dream meant.

Dan 4:4 Magicians, soothsayers, Chaldaeans and exorcists came, and I told them what I had dreamt, but they
could not interpret it for me.

Dan 4:5 Daniel, renamed Belteshazzar after my own god, and in whom the spirit of the holy gods resides, then
came into my presence. I told him my dream:



Dan 4:6 “‘Belteshazzar, chief of magicians’, I said, ‘I know that the spirit of the holy gods resides in you and
that no mystery puts you at a loss. This is the dream I have had; tell me what it means.

Dan 4:7 “‘The visions that passed through my head as I lay in bed were these: I saw a tree in the middle of the
world; it was very tall.

Dan 4:8 The tree grew taller and stronger, until its top reached the sky and it could be seen from the very ends
of the earth.

Dan 4:9 Its foliage was beautiful, its fruit abundant, in it was food for all. For the wild animals it provided shade,
the birds of heaven nested in its branches, all living creatures found their food on it.

Dan 4:10 “‘I watched the visions passing through my head as I lay in bed: Next, a Watchful One, a holy one,
came down from heaven.

Dan 4:1 1 At the top of his voice he shouted: Cut the tree down, lop off its branches, strip off its leaves, throw
away its fruit; let the animals flee from its shelter and the birds from its branches.

Dan 4:12 But leave the stump with its roots in the ground, bound with hoops of iron and bronze, in the grass of
the countryside. Let it be drenched by the dew of heaven and have its lot with the animals, eating grass!

Dan 4:13 Let it cease to have a human heart, and be given the heart of a beast, and seven times shall pass
over him!

Dan 4:14 Such is the sentence proclaimed by the Watchers, the verdict announced by the holy ones- so that
every living thing may learn that the Most High rules over human sovereignty; he confers it on whom he pleases,
and raises the lowest of humankind.

Dan 4:15 “‘This was the dream I had-l, Nebuchadnezzar the king. Now it is for you, Belteshazzar, to pronounce
on its meaning, since not one of the sages in my kingdom has been able to interpret it for me; you, however, can
do so, since the spirit of the holy gods resides in you’”.

Dan 4:16 Daniel, known as Belteshazzar, was confused for a time and upset. The king said, “Belteshazzar, do
not be upset at the dream and its meaning”. Belteshazzar answered, “My lord, may the dream apply to those who
hate you, and its meaning to your foes!

Dan 4:17 The tree you saw, so large and strong and tall that it reached the sky and could be seen throughout
the world,

Dan 4:18 the tree with beautiful foliage and abundant fruit, with food for all in it, providing shade for the wild
animals, with the birds of heaven nesting in its branches:

Dan 4:19 that tree is yourself, Your Majesty, for you have grown great and strong; your stature is now so great
that it reaches the sky, and your empire extends to the ends of the earth.

Dan 4:20 “And the Watchful One seen by the king, the holy one coming down from heaven and saying, ‘Cut the
tree down and destroy it, but leave stump and roots in the ground, bound with hoops of iron and bronze in the
grass of the countryside; let it be drenched by the dew and have its lot with the wild animals until seven times
have passed over it’:

Dan 4:21 the meaning of this, Your Majesty, the verdict of the Most High passed on my lord the king, is this:

Dan 4:22 You will be driven from human society and will make your home with the wild animals, you will feed on
grass, as oxen do, you will be drenched by the dew of heaven; seven times will pass over you until you have
learnt that the Most High rules over human sovereignty and confers it on whom he pleases.

Dan 4:23 “And the order, ‘Leave the stump and roots of the tree’, means that your kingdom will be kept for you
until you come to understand that Heaven rules all.

Dan 4:24 May it please the king to accept my advice: by upright actions break with your sins, break with your
crimes by showing mercy to the poor, and so live long and peacefully”.

Dan 4:25 This all happened to King Nebuchadnezzar.

Dan 4:26 At the end of twelve months, while strolling on the roof of the royal palace in Babylon,

Dan 4:27 the king was saying, “Great Babylon! Was it not built by me as a royal residence, by the force of my
might and for the majesty of my glory?”.

Dan 4:28 The words were not out of his mouth when a voice came down from heaven: “Of you, King
Nebuchadnezzar, it is decreed: the empire has been taken from you,

Dan 4:29 you will be driven from human society and will make your home with the wild animals; you will feed on
grass, as oxen do, and seven times will pass over you until you have learnt that the Most High rules over human
sovereignty and gives it to whom he pleases”.

Dan 4:30 The words were immediately fulfilled: Nebuchadnezzar was driven from human society and ate grass
as oxen do; he was drenched by the dew of heaven; his hair grew like an eagle’s feathers, and his nails became
like a bird’s talons.

Dan 4:31 “When the time was over, I, Nebuchad- nezzar, raised my eyes to heaven: my reason returned. And I
blessed the Most High, praising and glorifying him who lives for ever, for his empire is an everlasting empire, his
kingship endures, age after age.

Dan 4:32 All who dwell on earth count for nothing; as he thinks fit, he disposes the army of heaven and those



who dwell on earth. No one can arrest his hand or ask him, ‘What have you done?’.

Dan 4:33 “At that moment my reason returned and, for the honour of my royal state, my glory and splendour
returned too. My counsellors and noblemen acclaimed me; I was restored to my throne, and to my past
greatness even more was added.

Dan 4:34 And now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise, extol and glorify the King of heaven, all of whose deeds are true,
all of whose ways are right, and who can humble those who walk in pride”.

Dan 5:1 King Belshazzar gave a great banquet for his noblemen, a thousand of them, and, in the presence of
this thousand, he drank his wine.

Dan 5:2 Having tasted the wine, Belshazzar gave orders for the gold and silver vessels to be brought which his
father Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the sanctuary in Jerusalem, so that the king, his noblemen, his wives
and the women who sang for him could drink out of them.

Dan 5:3 The gold and silver vessels taken from the sanctuary of the Temple of God in Jerusalem were brought
in, and the king, his noblemen, his wives and the women who sang for him drank out of them.

Dan 5:4 They drank their wine and praised their idols of gold and silver, of bronze and iron, of wood and stone.
Dan 5:5 Suddenly, the fingers of a human hand appeared and began to write on the plaster of the palace wall,
directly behind the lamp-stand; and the king could see the hand as it wrote.

Dan 5:6 The king turned pale with alarm: his hip-joints went slack and his knees began to knock.

Dan 5:7 He shouted for his soothsayers, Chaldaeans, and exorcists. And the king said to the Babylonian sages,
“Anyone who can read this writing and tell me what it means shall be dressed in purple, and have a chain of gold
put round his neck, and be one of the three men who govern the kingdom”.

Dan 5:8 The king’s sages all crowded forward, but they could neither read the writing nor explain to the king
what it meant.

Dan 5:9 Greatly alarmed, King Belshazzar turned even paler, and his noblemen were equally disturbed.

Dan 5:10 Then the queen, attracted by the noise made by the king and his noblemen, came into the banqueting
hall. “May Your Majesty live for ever!”. said the queen. “Do not be alarmed, do not look so pale.

Dan 5:1 1 In your kingdom there is a man in whom lives the spirit of the holy gods. In your father’s days he was
known for a perception, intelligence and wisdom comparable to that of the gods. King Nebuchadnezzar, your
father, made him head of the magicians, soothsayers, Chaldaeans and exorcists.

Dan 5:12 Since this man Daniel, whom the king had renamed Belteshazzar, is filled with such a marvellous
spirit and such knowledge and intelligence in interpreting dreams, solving enigmas and unravelling difficult
problems, send for him; he will be able to tell you what this means”.

Dan 5:13 Daniel was brought into the king’s presence; the king said to Daniel, “Are you the Daniel who was one
of the Judaean exiles brought by my father the king from Judah?

Dan 5:14 I am told that the spirit of the gods lives in you, and that you are known for your perception,
intelligence and marvellous wisdom.

Dan 5:15 The sages and soothsayers have already been brought to me to read this writing and tell me what it
means, but they have been unable to reveal its meaning.

Dan 5:16 I am told that you are able to give interpretations and to unravel difficult problems, so if you can read
the writing and tell me what it means, you shall be dressed in purple, and have a chain of gold put round your
neck, and be one of the three men who govern the kingdom”.

Dan 5:17 Then Daniel spoke up in the presence of the king. “Keep your gifts for yourself”, he said, “and give your
rewards to others! I can certainly read the writing to the king and tell him what it means.

Dan 5:18 Your Majesty, the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father sovereignty, greatness, majesty
and glory.

Dan 5:19 He made him so great that all peoples, nations and languages shook with dread before him: he killed
whom he pleased, spared whom he pleased, promoted whom he pleased, degraded whom he pleased.

Dan 5:20 But because his heart grew swollen with pride, and his spirit stiff with arrogance, he was deposed from
his sovereign throne and stripped of his glory.

Dan 5:21 He was driven from human society, his heart was more like an animal’s than a man's; he lived with the
wild donkeys; he fed on grass like oxen; his body was drenched by the dew of heaven, until he had learnt that
the Most High rules over human sovereignty and appoints whom he pleases to rule it.

Dan 5:22 But you, Belshazzar, who are his son, you have not humbled your heart, in spite of knowing all this.
Dan 5:23 You have defied the Lord of heaven, you have had the vessels from his Temple brought to you, and
you, your noblemen, your wives and the women singing for you have drunk your wine out of them. You have
praised gods of gold and silver, of bronze and iron, of wood and stone, which can neither see, hear nor
understand; but you have given no glory to the God in whose hands are your breath itself and all your fortunes.
Dan 5:24 That is why he has sent the hand which has written these words.

Dan 5:25 The writing reads: mene, mene, teqel and parsin.

Dan 5:26 The meaning of the words is this: mene: God has measured your sovereignty and put an end to it;



Dan 5:27 teqel: you have been weighed in the balance and found wanting;

Dan 5:28 parsin: your kingdom has been divided and given to the Medes and the Persians”.

Dan 5:29 At Belshazzar’s order Daniel was dressed in purple, a chain of gold was put round his neck and he
was proclaimed as one of the three men who governed the kingdom.

Dan 5:30 That same night, the Chaldaean king Belshazzar was murdered,

Dan 6:1 and Darius the Mede received the kingdom, at the age of sixty-two.

Dan 6:2 It pleased Darius to appoint a hundred and twenty satraps over his kingdom for the various parts,

Dan 6:3 and over them three presidents — of whom Daniel was one — to whom the satraps were to be
responsible. This was to safeguard the king’s interests.

Dan 6:4 This Daniel, by virtue of the marvellous spirit residing in him, was so evidently superior to the other
presidents and satraps that the king considered appointing him to rule the whole kingdom.

Dan 6:5 The presidents and satraps, in consequence, started hunting for some affair of state by which they
could discredit Daniel; but they could find nothing to his discredit, and no case of negligence; he was so
punctilious that they could not find a single instance of maladministration or neglect.

Dan 6:6 These men then thought, “We shall never find a way of discrediting Daniel unless we try something to
do with the law of his God”.

Dan 6:7 The presidents and satraps then went in a body to the king. “King Darius”, they said, “live for ever!

Dan 6:8 We are all agreed, presidents of the realm, magistrates, satraps, councillors and governors, that the
king should issue an edict enforcing the following regulation: Whoëver within the next thirty days prays to
anyone, divine or human, other than to yourself, Your Majesty, is to be thrown into the lions’ den.

Dan 6:9 Your Majesty, ratify the edict at once by signing this document, making it unalterable, as befits the law
of the Medes and the Persians, which cannot be revoked”.

Dan 6:10 King Darius accordingly signed the document embodying the edict.

Dan 6:1 1 When Daniel heard that the document had been signed, he retired to his house. The windows of his
upstairs room faced towards Jerusalem. Three times each day, he went down on his knees, praying and giving
praise to God as he had always done.

Dan 6:12 These men came along in a body and found Daniel praying and pleading with God.

Dan 6:13 They then went to the king and reminded him of the royal edict, “Have you not signed an edict
forbidding anyone for the next thirty days to pray to anyone, divine or human, other than to yourself, Your
Majesty, on pain of being thrown into the lions’ den?”. “The decision stands”, the king replied, “as befits the law of
the Medes and the Persians, which cannot be revoked”.

Dan 6:14 They then said to the king, “Your Majesty, this man Daniel, one of the exiles from Judah, disregards
both you and the edict which you have signed: he is at his prayers three times each day”.

Dan 6:15 When the king heard these words he was deeply distressed and determined to save Daniel; he racked
his brains until sunset to find some way to save him.

Dan 6:16 But the men kept pressing the king, “Your Majesty, remember that in conformity with the law of the
Medes and the Persians, no edict or decree can be altered when once issued by the king”.

Dan 6:17 The king then ordered Daniel to be brought and thrown into the lion pit. The king said to Daniel, “Your
God, whom you have served so faithfully, will have to save you”.

Dan 6:18 A stone was then brought and laid over the mouth of the pit; and the king sealed it with his own signet
and with that of his noblemen, so that there could be no going back on the original decision about Daniel.

Dan 6:19 The king returned to his palace, spent the night in fasting and refused to receive any of his
concubines. Sleep eluded him,

Dan 6:20 and at the first sign of dawn he got up and hurried to the lion pit.

Dan 6:21 As he approached the pit he called in anguished tones to Daniel, “Daniel, servant of the living God!

Has your God, whom you serve so faithfully, been able to save you from the lions?”.

Dan 6:22 Daniel answered the king, “May Your Majesty live for ever!

Dan 6:23 My God sent his angel who sealed the lions’ jaws; they did me no harm, since in his sight I am
blameless; neither have I ever done you any wrong, Your Majesty”.

Dan 6:24 The king was overjoyed and ordered Daniel to be released from the pit. Daniel was released from the
pit and found to be quite unhurt, because he had trusted in his God.

Dan 6:25 The king then sent for the men who had accused Daniel and had them thrown into the lion pit, and
their wives and children too; and before they reached the floor of the pit the lions had seized them and crushed
their bones to pieces.

Dan 6:26 King Darius then wrote to all nations, peoples and languages dwelling throughout the world: “May you
prosper more and more!

Dan 6:27 This is my decree: Throughout every dominion of my realm, let all tremble with fear before the God of
Daniel: He is the living God, he endures for ever, his kingdom will never be destroyed and his empire never
come to an end.



Dan 6:28 He saves, sets free, and works signs and wonders in the heavens and on earth; he has saved Daniel
from the power of the lions”.

Dan 6:29 This Daniel flourished in the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian.

Dan 7:1 In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream and visions that passed through his
head as he lay in bed. He wrote the dream down, and this is how the narrative began:

Dan 7:2 Daniel said, “I have been seeing visions in the night. I saw that the four winds of heaven were stirring up
the Great Sea;

Dan 7:3 four great beasts emerged from the sea, each different from the others.

Dan 7:4 The first was like a lion with eagle’s wings and, as I looked, its wings were torn off, and it was lifted off
the ground and set standing on its feet like a human; and it was given a human heart.

Dan 7:5 And there before me was a second beast, like a bear, rearing up on one side, with three ribs in its
mouth, between its teeth. ‘Up!’. came the command. ‘Eat quantities of flesh!’.

Dan 7:6 After this I looked; and there before me was another beast, like a leopard, and with four bird’s wings on
its flanks; it had four heads and was granted authority.

Dan 7:7 Next, in the visions of the night, I saw another vision: there before me was a fourth beast, fearful,
terrifying, very strong; it had great iron teeth, and it ate its victims, crushed them, and trampled their remains
underfoot. It was different from the previous beasts and had ten horns.

Dan 7:8 “While I was looking at these horns, I saw another horn sprouting among them, a little one; three of the
original horns were pulled out by the roots to make way for it; and in this horn I saw eyes like human eyes, and a
mouth full of boasting.

Dan 7:9 While I was watching, thrones were set in place and one most venerable took his seat. His robe was
white as snow, the hair of his head as pure as wool. His throne was a blaze of flames, its wheels were a burning
fire.

Dan 7:10 A stream of fire poured out, issuing from his presence. A thousand thousand waited on him, ten
thousand times ten thousand stood before him. The court was in session and the books lay open.

Dan 7:1 1 “I went on watching: then, because of the noise made by the boastings of the horn, as I watched, the
beast was put to death, and its body destroyed and committed to the flames.

Dan 7:12 The other beasts were deprived of their empire, but received a lease of life for a season and a time.
Dan 7:13 I was gazing into the visions of the night, when I saw, coming on the clouds of heaven, as it were a
son of man. He came to the One most venerable and was led into his presence.

Dan 7:14 On him was conferred rule, honour and kingship, and all peoples, nations and languages became his
servants. His rule is an everlasting rule which will never pass away, and his kingship will never come to an end.
Dan 7:15 “I, Daniel, was deeply disturbed and the visions that passed through my head alarmed me.

Dan 7:16 So I approached one of those who were standing by and asked him about all this. And in reply he
revealed to me what these things meant.

Dan 7:17 ‘These four great beasts are four kings who will rise up from the earth.

Dan 7:18 Those who receive royal power are the holy ones of the Most High, and kingship will be theirs for ever,

for ever and ever’.

Dan 7:19 Then I asked about the fourth beast, different from all the rest, very terrifying, with iron teeth and
bronze claws; it ate its victims, crushed them, and trampled their remains underfoot;

Dan 7:20 and about the ten horns on its head — and why the other horn sprouted and the three original horns
fell, and why this horn had eyes and a mouth full of boasting, and why it looked more impressive than its fellows.
Dan 7:21 This was the horn I had watched making war on the holy ones and proving the stronger,

Dan 7:22 until the coming of the One most venerable who gave judgement in favour of the holy ones of the Most

High, when the time came for the holy ones to assume kingship.

Dan 7:23 This is what he said: ‘The fourth beast is to be a fourth kingdom on earth, different from all other
kingdoms. It will devour the whole world, trample it underfoot and crush it.

Dan 7:24 As for the ten horns: from this kingdom will rise ten kings, and another after them; this one will be
different from the previous ones and will bring down three kings;

Dan 7:25 he will insult the Most High, and torment the holy ones of the Most High. He will plan to alter the
seasons and the Law, and the Saints will be handed over to him for a time, two times, and half a time.

Dan 7:26 But the court will sit, and he will be stripped of his royal authority which will be finally destroyed and
reduced to nothing.

Dan 7:27 And kingship and rule and the splendours of all the kingdoms under heaven will be given to the people
of the holy ones of the Most High, whose royal power is an eternal power, whom every empire will serve and
obey’.

Dan 7:28 “Here the narrative ends. “I, Daniel, was greatly disturbed in mind, and I grew pale; but I kept these
things to myself”.

Dan 8:1 In the third year of King Belshazzar a vision appeared to me, Daniel, after the one that had originally



appeared to me.

Dan 8:2 I gazed at the vision, and as I gazed I found myself in Susa, the citadel in the province of Elam; gazing
at the vision, I found myself at the Ulai Gate.

Dan 8:3 I raised my eyes to look, and I saw a ram standing in front of the gate. It had two horns; both were tall,
but one taller than the other, and the one that rose the higher was the second.

Dan 8:4 I saw the ram butting westwards, northwards and southwards. No animal could stand up to it, nothing
could escape its power. It did as it pleased and became strong.

Dan 8:5 This is what I observed: a he-goat from the west, encroaching over the entire surface of the world
though never touching the ground, and between its eyes the goat had one majestic horn.

Dan 8:6 It advanced on the two-horned ram, which I had seen standing in front of the gate, and charged at it in
the full force of its fury.

Dan 8:7 I saw it reach the ram; it was enraged with the ram and struck it, breaking both its horns, so that the
ram was not strong enough to hold its ground; it threw it to the ground and trampled it underfoot; no one was
there to rescue the ram.

Dan 8:8 The he-goat then grew more powerful than ever; but at the height of its strength the great horn
snapped, and in its place sprouted four majestic horns, pointing to the four winds of heaven.

Dan 8:9 From one of these, the small one, sprang a horn which grew to great size towards south and east and
towards the Land of Splendour.

Dan 8:10 It grew right up to the armies of heaven and flung armies and stars to the ground, and trampled them
underfoot.

Dan 8:11 It even challenged the power of the Prince of the army; it abolished the perpetual sacrifice and
overthrew the foundation of his sanctuary,

Dan 8:12 and the army too; over the sacrifice it installed iniquity and flung truth to the ground; the horn was
active and successful.

Dan 8:13 I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one say to the speaker, “How long is this vision to be —
of perpetual sacrifice, of horrifying iniquity, of sanctuary and army trampled underfoot?”.

Dan 8:14 The first replied, “Until two thousand three hundred evenings and mornings have gone by: then the
sanctuary will have its rights restored”.

Dan 8:15 As I, Daniel, gazed at the vision and tried to understand it, I saw someöne standing in front of me who
looked like a man.

Dan 8:16 I heard a human voice cry over the Ulai, “Gabriel, tell him the meaning of the vision!”.

Dan 8:17 He approached the place where I was standing; as he approached, I was seized with terror and fell
prostrate on the ground. “Son of man”, he said to me, “understand this: the vision shows the time of the End”.

Dan 8:18 He was still speaking, when I fainted, face downwards on the ground. He touched me, however, and
raised me to my feet.

Dan 8:19 “Come”, he said, “I shall tell you what is going to happen when the Retribution is over, about the final
times.

Dan 8:20 As for the ram which you saw, its two horns are the kings of Media and of Persia.

Dan 8:21 The hairy he-goat is the king of Greece, the large horn between its eyes is the first king.

Dan 8:22 The horn which snapped and the four horns which sprouted in its place are four kingdoms rising from
his nation but not having his strength.

Dan 8:23 “And at the end of their reign, when the measure of their sins is full, a king will arise, a proud-faced,
ingenious-minded man.

Dan 8:24 His power will grow greater and greater, though not through any power of his own; he will plot
incredible schemes, he will succeed in whatever he undertakes, he will destroy powerful men and the holy ones,
God’s people.

Dan 8:25 Such will be his resourcefulness of mind that all his treacherous activities will succeed. He will grow
arrogant of heart and destroy many people by taking them unawares. He will challenge the power of the Prince
of princes but, without any human intervention, he will be broken.

Dan 8:26 The vision of the evenings and the mornings which has been revealed is true, but you must keep the
vision secret, for there are still many days to go”.

Dan 8:27 At this I, Daniel, lost consciousness; I was ill for several days. Then I got up to discharge my duties in
the king’s service, keeping the vision a secret and still not understanding what it meant.

Dan 9:1 It was the first year of Darius son of Artaxerxes, a Mede by race who assumed the throne of Chaldaea.
Dan 9:2 In the first year of his reign I, Daniel, was studying the scriptures, counting over the number of years —
as revealed by Yahweh to the prophet Jeremiah — that were to pass before the desolation of Jerusalem would
come to an end, namely seventy years.

Dan 9:3 I turned my face to the Lord God begging for time to pray and to plead, with fasting, sackcloth and
ashes.



Dan 9:4 I pleaded with Yahweh my God and made this confession: “O my Lord, God great and to be feared, you
keep the covenant and show faithful love towards those who love you and who observe your commandments:
Dan 9:5 we have sinned, we have done wrong, we have acted wickedly, we have betrayed your
commandments and rulings and turned away from them.

Dan 9:6 We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our chief
men, our ancestors and all people of the country.

Dan 9:7 Saving justice, Lord, is yours; we have only the look of shame we wear today, we, the people of Judah,
the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the whole of Israel, near and far away, in every country to which you have
dispersed us because of the treachery we have committed against you.

Dan 9:8 To us, our kings, our chief men and our ancestors, belongs the look of shame, O Yahweh, since we
have sinned against you.

Dan 9:9 And it is for the Lord our God to have mercy and to pardon, since we have betrayed him,

Dan 9:10 and have not listened to the voice of Yahweh our God nor followed the laws he has given us through
his servants the prophets.

Dan 9:1 1 The whole of Israel has flouted your Law and turned away, unwilling to listen to your voice; and the
curse and imprecation written in the Law of Moses, the servant of God, have come pouring down on us, because
we have sinned against him.

Dan 9:12 He has carried out the threats which he made against us and the chief men who governed us — that
he would bring so great a disaster down on us that the fate of Jerusalem would find no parallel under all heaven.
Dan 9:13 And now, as written in the Law of Moses, this whole calamity has befallen us; even so, we have not
appeased Yahweh our God by renouncing our crimes and learning your truth.

Dan 9:14 Yahweh has watched for the right moment to bring disaster on us, since Yahweh our God is just in all
his dealings with us, and we have not listened to his voice.

Dan 9:15 And now, Lord our God, who by your mighty hand brought us out of Egypt — the renown you won then
endures to this day — we have sinned, we have done wrong.

Dan 9:16 Lord, by all your acts of saving justice, turn away your anger and your fury from Jerusalem, your city,
your holy mountain, for as a result of our sins and the crimes of our ancestors, Jerusalem and your people are
objects of scorn to all who surround us.

Dan 9:17 And now, our God, listen to the prayer and pleading of your servant. For your own sake, Lord, let your
face smile again on your desolate sanctuary.

Dan 9:18 Listen, my God, listen to us; open your eyes and look at our plight and at the city that bears your
name. Relying not on our upright deeds but on your great mercy, we pour out our plea to you.

Dan 9:19 Listen, Lord! Forgive, Lord! Hear, Lord, and act! For your own sake, my God, do not delay — since
your city and your people alike bear your name”.

Dan 9:20 I was still speaking, still at prayer, confessing my own sins and the sins of my people Israel, and
placing my plea before Yahweh my God for the holy mountain of my God,

Dan 9:21 still speaking, still at prayer, when Gabriel, the being I had originally seen in vision, swooped on me in
full flight at the hour of the evening sacrifice.

Dan 9:22 He came, he spoke, he said to me, “Now, Daniel; I have come down to teach you how to understand.
Dan 9:23 When your pleading began, a word was uttered, and I have come to tell you. You are a man specially
chosen. Grasp the meaning of the word, understand the vision:

Dan 9:24 “Seventy weeks are decreed for your people and your holy city, for putting an end to transgression, for
placing the seal on sin, for expiating crime, for introducing everlasting uprightness for setting the seal on vision
and on prophecy, for anointing the holy of holies.

Dan 9:25 Know this, then, and understand: From the time there went out this message: ‘Return and rebuild
Jerusalem’ to the coming of an Anointed Prince, seven weeks and sixty-two weeks, with squares and ramparts
restored and rebuilt, but in a time of trouble.

Dan 9:26 And after the sixty-two weeks an Anointed One put to death without his … city and sanctuary ruined
by a prince who is to come. The end of that prince will be catastrophe and, until the end, there will be war and all
the devastation decreed.

Dan 9:27 He will strike a firm alliance with many people for the space of a week; and for the space of one half-
week he will put a stop to sacrifice and oblation, and on the wing of the Temple will be the appalling abomination
until the end, until the doom assigned to the devastator”.

Dan 10:1 In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia, a revelation was made to Daniel known as Belteshazzar, a
true revelation of a great conflict. He grasped the meaning of the revelation; what it meant was disclosed to him
in a vision.

Dan 10:2 At that time, I, Daniel, was doing a three-week penance;

Dan 1 0:3 I ate no agreeable food, touched no meat or wine, and did not anoint myself, until these three weeks
were over.



Dan 10:4 On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, as I stood on the bank of that great river, the Tigris,

Dan 10:5 I raised my eyes to look about me, and this is what I saw: A man dressed in linen, with a belt of pure
gold round his waist:

Dan 10:6 his body was like beryl, his face looked like lightning, his eyes were like fiery torches, his arms and his
face had the gleam of burnished bronze, the sound of his voice was like the roar of a multitude.

Dan 10:7 I, Daniel, alone saw the apparition; the men who were with me did not see the vision, but so great a
trembling overtook them that they fled to hide.

Dan 10:8 I was left alone, gazing on this great vision; I was powerless, my appearance was changed and
contorted; my strength deserted me.

Dan 10:9 I heard a voice speaking, and at the sound of the voice I fell fainting, face downwards on the ground.
Dan 10:10 I felt a hand touching me, setting my knees and my hands trembling.

Dan 10:1 1 He said, “Daniel, you are a man specially chosen; understand the words that I am about to say; stand
up; I have been sent to you now”. He said this, and I stood up trembling.

Dan 10:12 He then said, “Daniel, do not be afraid: from that first day when, the better to understand, you
resolved to mortify yourself before God, your words have been heard; and your words are the reason why I have
come.

Dan 10:13 The Prince of the kingdom of Persia has been resisting me for twenty-one days, but Michael, one of
the Chief Princes, came to my assistance. I have left him confronting the kings of Persia
Dan 10:14 and have come to tell you what will happen to your people in the final days. For here is a new vision
about those days”.

Dan 10:15 When he had said these things to me, I prostrated myself on the ground, without saying a word;

Dan 10:16 then someöne looking like a man touched my lips. I opened my mouth to speak, and I said to the
person standing in front of me, “My lord, anguish overcomes me at this vision, and my strength deserts me.

Dan 10:17 How can your servant speak to my lord now that I have no strength left and my breath fails me?”.

Dan 10:18 Once again, the person like a man touched me; he gave me strength.

Dan 10:19 “Do not be afraid”, he said, “you are a man specially chosen; peace be with you; play the man, be
strong!”. And as he spoke to me I felt strong again and said, “Let my lord speak, you have given me strength”.

Dan 10:20 He then said, “Do you know why I have come to you?

Dan 10:21 It is to tell you what is written in the Book of Truth. I must go back to fight the Prince of Persia; when I
have overcome him, the Prince of Javan will come next. In all this, there is no one to lend me support except
Michael your Prince,

Dan 11:1 on whom I rely to give me support and to reinforce me.

Dan 1 1 :2 And now I shall tell you the truth about these things. “Three more kings are going to rise in Persia; a
fourth will come and be richer than all the others, and when, thanks to his wealth, he has grown powerful, he will
make war on all the kingdoms of Greece.

Dan 1 1 :3 A mighty king will rise and govern a vast empire and do whatever he pleases.

Dan 1 1 :4 But once he has come to power, his empire will be broken up and parcelled out to the four winds of
heaven, though not to his descendants: it will not be ruled as he ruled it, for his sovereignty will be uprooted and
will pass to others than his own descendants.

Dan 1 1 :5 “The king of the south will grow powerful, but one of his princes will grow more powerful still, with an
empire greater than his own.

Dan 1 1 :6 Some years later, these will conclude a treaty and, to ratify the agreement, the daughter of the king of
the south will go to the king of the north. Her arm will not, however, retain its strength, nor his posterity endure:
she will be handed over, she, her escorts and her child, and he who has had authority over her. In due time
Dan 11:7 a sprig from her roots will rise in his place, will march on the defences, force the stronghold of the king
of the north, and succeed in overcoming them.

Dan 11:8 He will even carry off all their gods, their statues, their precious gold and silver vessels as booty to
Egypt. For some years he will leave the king of the north in peace,

Dan 1 1 :9 but the latter will invade the kingdom of the king of the south, then retire to his own country.

Dan 11:10 His sons will next be on the march, mustering a host of powerful forces; and he will advance, deploy,
break through and march on the southern stronghold once again.

Dan 11:11 The king of the south will fly into a rage and set out to give battle to the king of the north, who will
have an immense army on his side, but this army will be defeated by him.

Dan 11:12 The army will be annihilated; he will be triumphant; he will overthrow tens of thousands; yet he will
have no enduring strength.

Dan 11:13 The king of the north will come back, having recruited an even larger army than before, and finally,
after some years, he will advance a second time with a great army and plentiful supplies.

Dan 11:14 At that time, many will take up arms against the king of the south, and the more violent of your own
people will rebel in the hope of realising the vision; but they will fail.



Dan 11:15 The king of the north will then come and throw up siege-works to capture a strongly fortified city. The
forces of the south will not stand their ground; the pick of the people will not be strong enough to resist.

Dan 11:16 The invader will do as he pleases, no one will be able to resist him: he will take his stand in the Land
of Splendour, destruction in his hands.

Dan 11:17 He will set about conquering his entire kingdom, but will then make a treaty with him and, to
overthrow the kingdom, give him a woman’s hand; but this will not last or be to his advantage.

Dan 11:18 He will next turn to the coasts and islands and conquer many of them, but a magistrate will put a stop
to his outrages in such a way that he will be unable to repay outrage for outrage.

Dan 11:19 “He will then turn on the strongholds of his own country, but will stumble, fall, and never be seen
again.

Dan 1 1 :20 In his place there will rise a man who will send an extortioner to despoil the royal splendour; in a few
days he will be shattered, though neither publicly nor in battle.

Dan 1 1 :21 “In his place will rise a wretch: royal honours will not be given to him, but rather he will insinuate
himself into them at his pleasure and will gain possession of the kingdom by intrigue.

Dan 1 1 :22 Armies will be utterly routed and crushed by him, the Prince of the covenant too.

Dan 1 1 :23 Through his alliances he will act treacherously and, despite the smallness of his following, grow ever
stronger.

Dan 1 1 :24 At his pleasure, he will invade rich provinces, acting as his fathers or his fathers’ fathers never acted,
distributing among them plunder, spoil and wealth, plotting his stratagems against the fortresses — for a time.

Dan 1 1 :25 “He will summon up his might and courage against the king of the south with a great army. The king
of the south will march to war with a huge and powerful army but will not succeed, since he will be outwitted by
trickery.

Dan 1 1 :26 Those who shared his food will ruin him; his army will be swept away, many will fall in the slaughter.
Dan 1 1 :27 “The two kings, seated at one table, hearts bent on evil, will tell their lies; but they will not have their
way, for the appointed time is still to come.

Dan 1 1 :28 Then the wretch will return greatly enriched to his own country, his heart set against the holy
covenant; he will take action and then return to his own country.

Dan 1 1 :29 In due time, he will make his way southwards again, but this time the outcome will not be as before.
Dan 1 1 :30 The ships of the Kittim will oppose him, and he will be worsted. He will retire and take furious action
against the holy covenant and, as before, will favour those who forsake that holy covenant.

Dan 1 1 :31 “Forces of his will come and profane the Citadel-Sanctuary; they will abolish the perpetual sacrifice
and install the appalling abomination there.

Dan 1 1 :32 Those who break the covenant he will seduce by his blandishments, but the people who know their
God will stand firm and take action.

Dan 1 1 :33 Those of the people who are wise leaders will instruct many; for some days, however, they will
stumble from sword and flame, captivity and pillage.

Dan 1 1 :34 And thus stumbling, little help will they receive, though many will be scheming in their support.

Dan 1 1 :35 Of the wise leaders some will stumble, and so a number of them will be purged, purified and made
clean — until the time of the End, for the appointed time is still to come.

Dan 1 1 :36 “The king will do as he pleases, growing more and more arrogant, considering himself greater than
all the gods; he will utter incredible blasphemies against the God of gods, and he will thrive until the wrath
reaches bursting point; for what has been decreed will certainly be fulfilled.

Dan 1 1 :37 Heedless of his fathers’ gods, heedless of the god whom women love, heedless of any god
whatever, he will consider himself greatest of all.

Dan 1 1 :38 Instead of them, he will honour the god of fortresses, will honour a god unknown to his ancestors
with gold and silver, precious stones and valuable presents.

Dan 1 1 :39 He will use the people of an alien god to defend the fortresses; he will confer great honours on those
whom he acknowledges, by giving them wide authority and by parcelling the country out for rent.

Dan 1 1 :40 “When the time comes for the End, the king of the south will try conclusions with him; but the king of
the north will come storming down on him with chariots, cavalry, and a large fleet. He will invade countries,
overrun them and drive on.

Dan 1 1 :41 He will invade the Land of Splendour, and many will fall; but Edom, Moab, and what remains of the
sons of Ammon will escape him.

Dan 1 1 :42 “He will reach out to attack countries: Egypt will not escape him.

Dan 1 1 :43 The gold and silver treasures and all the valuables of Egypt will lie in his power. Libyans and
Cushites will be at his feet:

Dan 1 1 :44 but reports coming from the East and the north will worry him, and in great fury he will set out to bring
ruin and complete destruction to many.

Dan 1 1 :45 He will pitch the tents of his royal headquarters between the sea and the mountains of the Holy



Splendour. Yet he will come to his end — there will be no help for him”.

Dan 12:1 “At that time Michael will arise — the great Prince, defender of your people. That will be a time of great
distress, unparalleled since nations first came into existence. When that time comes, your own people will be
spared — all those whose names are found written in the Book.

Dan 1 2:2 “Of those who are sleeping in the Land of Dust, many will awaken, some to everlasting life, some to
shame and everlasting disgrace.

Dan 1 2:3 Those who are wise will shine as brightly as the expanse of the heavens, and those who have
instructed many in uprightness, as bright as stars for all eternity.

Dan 1 2:4 “But you, Daniel, must keep these words secret and keep the book sealed until the time of the End.
Many will roam about, this way and that, and wickedness will continue to increase”.

Dan 12:5 I, Daniel, then looked and saw two other people standing, one on the near bank of the river, the other
on the far.

Dan 12:6 One of them said to the man dressed in linen who was standing further up the stream, “How long until
these wonders take place?”.

Dan 12:7 I heard the man speak who was dressed in linen, standing further up the stream: he raised his right
hand and his left to heaven and swore by him who lives for ever, “A time and two times, and half a time; and all
these things will come true, once the crushing of the holy people’s power is over”.

Dan 12:8 I listened but did not understand. I then said, “My lord, what is to be the outcome?”.

Dan 1 2:9 “Go, Daniel”, he said. “These words are to remain secret and sealed until the time of the End.

Dan 12:10 Many will be cleansed, made white and purged; the wicked will persist in doing wrong; the wicked will
never understand; those who are wise will understand.

Dan 12:1 1 From the moment that the perpetual sacrifice is abolished and the appalling abomination set up: a
thousand two hundred and ninety days.

Dan 12:12 Blessed is he who perseveres and attains a thousand three hundred and thirty-five days.

Dan 12:13 But you, go away and rest; and you will rise for your reward at the end of time”.

Dan 13:1 In Babylon there lived a man named Joakim.

Dan 13:2 He was married to a woman called Susanna daughter of Hilkiah, a woman of great beauty; and she
was God-fearing, for

Dan 13:3 her parents were worthy people and had instructed their daughter in the Law of Moses.

Dan 13:4 Joakim was a very rich man and had a garden by his house; he used to be visited by a considerable
number of the Jews, since he was held in greater respect than any other man.

Dan 1 3:5 Two elderly men had been selected from the people, that year, to act as judges. Of such the Lord had
said, “Wickedness has come to Babylon through the elders and judges posing as guides to the people”.

Dan 13:6 These men were often at Joakim’s house, and all who were engaged in litigation used to come to
them.

Dan 13:7 At midday, when the people had gone away, Susanna would take a walk in her husband’s garden.

Dan 1 3:8 The two elders, who used to watch her every day as she came in to take her walk, gradually began to
desire her.

Dan 13:9 They threw reason aside, making no effort to turn their eyes to Heaven, and forgetting the demands of
virtue.

Dan 13:10 Both were inflamed by passion for her, but they hid their desire from each other,

Dan 13:1 1 for they were ashamed to admit the longing to sleep with her,

Dan 13:12 but they made sure of watching her every day.

Dan 13:13 One day, having parted with the words, “Let us go home, then, it is time for the midday meal”, they
went off in different directions,

Dan 13:14 only to retrace their steps and find themselves face to face again. Obliged then to explain, they
admitted their desire and agreed to look for an opportunity of surprising her alone.

Dan 13:15 So they waited for a favourable moment; and one day Susanna came as usual, accompanied only by
two young maidservants. The day was hot and she wanted to bathe in the garden.

Dan 13:16 There was no one about except the two elders, spying on her from their hiding place.

Dan 13:17 She said to the servants, “Bring me some oil and balsam and shut the garden door while I bathe”.

Dan 13:18 They did as they were told, shutting the garden door and going back to the house by a side entrance
to fetch what she had asked for; they knew nothing about the elders, for they had concealed themselves.

Dan 13:19 Hardly were the maids gone than the two elders sprang up and rushed upon her.

Dan 13:20 “Look”, they said, “the garden door is shut, no one can see us. We want to have you, so give in and
let us!

Dan 13:21 Refuse, and we shall both give evidence that a young man was with you and that this was why you
sent your maids away”.

Dan 13:22 Susanna sighed. “I am trapped”, she said, “whatever I do. If I agree, it means death for me; if I resist, I



cannot get away from you.

Dan 1 3:23 But I prefer to fall innocent into your power than to sin in the eyes of the Lord”.

Dan 13:24 She then cried out as loud as she could. The two elders began shouting too, putting the blame on
her,

Dan 13:25 and one of them ran to open the garden door.

Dan 13:26 The household, hearing the shouting in the garden, rushed out by the side entrance to see what had
happened to her.

Dan 13:27 Once the elders had told their story, the servants were thoroughly taken aback, since nothing of this
sort had ever been said of Susanna.

Dan 1 3:28 Next day a meeting was held at the house of her husband Joakim. The two elders arrived, full of their
wicked plea against Susanna, to have her put to death.

Dan 1 3:29 They addressed the company, “Summon Susanna daughter of Hilkiah and wife of Joakim”. She was
sent for,

Dan 13:30 and came accompanied by her parents, her children and all her relations.

Dan 13:31 Susanna was very graceful and beautiful to look at;

Dan 1 3:32 she was veiled, so the wretches made her unveil in order to feast their eyes on her beauty.

Dan 13:33 All her own people were weeping, and so were all the others who saw her.

Dan 13:34 The two elders stood up, with all the people round them, and laid their hands on her head.

Dan 13:35 Tearfully she turned her eyes to Heaven, her heart confident in God.

Dan 13:36 The elders then spoke, “While we were walking by ourselves in the garden, this woman arrived with
two maids. She shut the garden door and then dismissed the servants.

Dan 1 3:37 A young man, who had been hiding, went over to her and they lay together.

Dan 13:38 From the end of the garden where we were, we saw this crime taking place and hurried towards
them.

Dan 13:39 Though we saw them together, we were unable to catch the man: he was too strong for us; he
opened the door and took to his heels.

Dan 13:40 We did, however, catch this woman and ask her who the young man was.

Dan 1 3:41 She refused to tell us. That is our evidence”. Since they were elders of the people and judges, the
assembly accepted their word: Susanna was condemned to death.

Dan 13:42 She cried out as loud as she could, “Eternal God, you know all secrets and everything before it
happens;

Dan 13:43 you know that they have given false evidence against me. And now I must die, innocent as I am of
everything their malice has invented against me!”.

Dan 13:44 The Lord heard her cry

Dan 13:45 and, as she was being led away to die, he roused the holy spirit residing in a young boy called Daniel

Dan 1 3:46 who began to shout, “I am innocent of this woman’s death!”.

Dan 1 3:47 At this all the people turned to him and asked, “What do you mean by that?”.

Dan 13:48 Standing in the middle of the crowd, he replied, “Are you so stupid, children of Israel, as to condemn
a daughter of Israel unheard, and without troubling to find out the truth?

Dan 13:49 Go back to the scene of the trial: these men have given false evidence against her”.

Dan 13:50 All the people hurried back, and the elders said to Daniel, “Come and sit with us and tell us what you

mean, since God has given you the gifts that elders have”.

Dan 1 3:51 Daniel said, “Keep the men well apart from each other, for I want to question them”.

Dan 13:52 When the men had been separated, Daniel had one of them brought to him. “You have grown old in
wickedness”, he said, “and now the sins of your earlier days have overtaken you,

Dan 13:53 you with your unjust judgements, your condemnation of the innocent, your acquittal of the guilty,
although the Lord has said, ‘You must not put the innocent and upright to death’.

Dan 1 3:54 Now then, since you saw her so clearly, tell me what sort of tree you saw them lying under”. He
replied, “Under an acacia tree”.

Dan 13:55 Daniel said, “Indeed! Your lie recoils on your own head: the angel of God has already received from
him your sentence and will cut you in half”.

Dan 1 3:56 He dismissed the man, ordered the other to be brought and said to him, “Son of Canaan, not of
Judah, beauty has seduced you, lust has led your heart astray!

Dan 13:57 This is how you have been behaving with the daughters of Israel, and they have been too frightened
to resist; but here is a daughter of Judah who could not stomach your wickedness!

Dan 1 3:58 Now then, tell me what sort of tree you surprised them under”. He replied, “Under an aspen tree”.

Dan 13:59 Daniel said, “Indeed! Your lie recoils on your own head: the angel of God is waiting with a sword to
rend you in half, and destroy the pair of you”.

Dan 13:60 Then the whole assembly shouted, blessing God, the Saviour of those who trust in him.



Dan 13:61 And they turned on the two elders whom Daniel had convicted of false evidence out of their own
mouths.

Dan 13:62 As the Law of Moses prescribes, they were given the same punishment as they had schemed to
inflict on their neighbour. They were put to death. And thus, that day, an innocent life was saved.

Dan 13:63 Hilkiah and his wife gave thanks to God for their daughter Susanna, and so did her husband Joakim
and all his relations, because she had been acquitted of anything dishonourable.

Dan 13:64 From that day onwards, Daniel’s reputation stood high with the people.

Dan 14:1 When King Astyages joined his ancestors, Cyrus of Persia succeeded him.

Dan 14:2 Daniel was very close to the king, who respected him more than any of his other friends.

Dan 14:3 Now, in Babylon there was an idol called Bel, to which twelve bushels of the finest flour, forty sheep
and six measures of wine were offered every day.

Dan 14:4 The king venerated this idol and used to go and worship it every day. Daniel, however, worshipped his
own God.

Dan 14:5 “Why do you not worship Bel?”. the king asked Daniel. “I do not worship idols made by human hand”,
Daniel replied, “I worship the living God who made heaven and earth and who is lord over all living creatures”.
Dan 14:6 “Do you not believe, then”, said the king, “that Bel is a living god? Can you not see how much he eats
and drinks each day?”.

Dan 14:7 Daniel laughed. “Your Majesty”, he said, “do not be taken in; he is clay inside, and bronze outside, and
has never eaten or drunk anything”.

Dan 14:8 This made the king angry; he summoned his priests, “Tell me who eats all this food”, he said, “or die.
Prove to me that Bel really eats it, and I will have Daniel put to death for blaspheming him”.

Dan 14:9 Daniel said to the king, “Let it be as you say”.

Dan 14:10 There were seventy of these priests, to say nothing of their wives and children. The king went to the
temple of Bel, taking Daniel with him.

Dan 14:1 1 The priests of Bel said to him, “We shall now go out, and you, Your Majesty, will lay out the meal and
mix the wine and set it out. Then, lock the door and seal it with your personal seal. If, when you return in the
morning, you do not find that everything has been eaten by Bel, let us be put to death; otherwise let Daniel, that
slanderer!’

Dan 14:12 They were thinking — hence their confidence — of a secret entrance which they had made under the
table, and by which they came in regularly and took the offerings away.

Dan 14:13 When the priests had gone and the king had set out the food for Bel,

Dan 14:14 Daniel made his servants bring ashes and spread them all over the temple floor, with no other
witness than the king. They then left the building, shut the door and, sealing it with the king’s seal, went away.
Dan 14:15 That night, as usual, the priests came with their wives and children; they ate and drank everything.
Dan 14:16 The king was up very early next morning, and Daniel with him.

Dan 14:17 “Daniel”, said the king, “are the seals intact?”. “They are intact, Your Majesty”, he replied.

Dan 14:18 The king then opened the door and, taking one look at the table, exclaimed, “You are great, O Bel!
There is no deception in you!”.

Dan 14:19 But Daniel laughed; and, restraining the king from going in any further, he said, “Look at the floor and
take note whose footmarks these are!”.

Dan 14:20 “I can see the footmarks of men, of women and of children”, said the king,

Dan 14:21 and angrily ordered the priests to be arrested, with their wives and children. They then showed him
the secret door through which they used to come and take what was on the table.

Dan 14:22 The king had them put to death and handed Bel over to Daniel who destroyed both the idol and its
temple.

Dan 14:23 There was a great dragon which the Babylonians worshipped too.

Dan 14:24 The king said to Daniel, “Are you going to tell me that this is made of bronze? Look, it is alive; it eats
and drinks; you cannot deny that this is a living god; worship it, then”.

Dan 14:25 Daniel replied, “I will worship the Lord my God; he is the living God. With your permission, Your
Majesty, without using either sword or club, I shall kill this dragon”.

Dan 14:26 “You have my permission”, said the king.

Dan 14:27 Whereüpon, Daniel took some pitch, some fat and some hair and boiled them up together, rolled the
mixture into balls and fed them to the dragon; the dragon swallowed them and burst. Daniel said, “Now look at
the sort of thing you worship!”.

Dan 14:28 The Babylonians were furious when they heard about this and rose against the king. “The king has
turned Jew”, they said, “he has allowed Bel to be overthrown, and the dragon to be killed, and he has put the
priests to death”.

Dan 14:29 So they went to the king and said, “Hand Daniel over to us or else we shall kill you and your family”.
Dan 14:30 They pressed him so hard that the king found himself forced to hand Daniel over to them.



Dan 14:31 They threw Daniel into the lion pit, and there he stayed for six days.

Dan 14:32 In the pit were seven lions, which were given two human bodies and two sheep every day; but for
this period they were not given anything, to make sure they would eat Daniel.

Dan 14:33 Now, the prophet Habakkuk was in Judaea: he had been making a stew and breaking up bread into
a basket. He was on his way to the fields, taking this to the harvesters,

Dan 14:34 when the angel of the Lord spoke to him, Take the meal you are carrying to Babylon, and give it to
Daniel in the lion pit”.

Dan 14:35 “Lord”, replied Habakkuk, “I have not even seen Babylon and know nothing about this pit”.

Dan 1 4:36 The angel of the Lord took hold of his head and carried him off by the hair to Babylon where, with a
great blast of his breath, he set Habakkuk down on the edge of the pit.

Dan 14:37 “Daniel, Daniel”, Habakkuk shouted, “take the meal that God has sent you”.

Dan 14:38 And Daniel said, “You have kept me in mind, O God; you have not deserted those who love you”.

Dan 14:39 Rising to his feet, he ate the meal, while the angel of God carried Habakkuk back in a moment to his
own country.

Dan 14:40 On the seventh day, the king came to lament over Daniel; on reaching the pit he looked inside, and
there sat Daniel.

Dan 14:41 “You are great, O Lord, God of Daniel”, he exclaimed, “there is no god but you!”.

Dan 14:42 He then had Daniel released from the pit and the plotters of Daniel’s ruin thrown in instead, where
they were instantly eaten before his eyes.





Oba 1:1 Vision of Obadiah: about Edom. I have received a message from Yahweh, a herald has been sent
throughout the nations: “Up! Let us march against this people. Into battle!”. The Lord Yahweh says this:

Oba 1:2 Look, I have reduced you to the smallest of nations, you are now beneath contempt.

Oba 1:3 Your proud heart has misled you, you whose home is in the crannies of the Rock, who make the
heights your dwelling, who think to yourself, “Who can bring me down to earth?”.

Oba 1:4 Though you soar like an eagle, though you set your nest among the stars, I shall bring you down from
therel-declares Yahweh.

Oba 1 :5 If thieves were to come to you (or robbers during the night) surely they would steal only as much as
they wanted? If grape-pickers were to come to you, surely they would leave a few gleanings? But how you have
been pillaged!



Oba 1:6 How Esau has been looted, his hidden treasures routed out!

Oba 1:7 Your allies all pursued you right to the frontier, your confederates kept you in suspense, then got the
better of you, your own guests laid a trap for you, “He has quite lost his wits”.

Oba 1:8 When that day comes- declares Yahweh- shall I not eliminate sages from Edom and intelligence from
Mount Esau?

Oba 1:9 Your warriors, Teman, will be so demoralised that the people of Mount Esau will be massacred to the
last one. For the slaughter,

Oba 1:10 for the violence done to your brother Jacob, shame will cover you and you will be annihilated for ever.
Oba 1:11 On the day, when you stood aloof while strangers carried off his riches, while foreigners passed
through his gate and cast lots for Jerusalem, you were as bad as the rest of them.

Oba 1:12 Do not feast your eyes on your brother on the day of his misfortune. Do not gloat over the children of
Judah on the day of their ruin. Do not play the braggart on the day of distress.

Oba 1:13 Do not enter my people’s gate on their day of calamity. Do not, you especially, feast your eyes on their
suffering on their day of calamity. Do not touch their possessions on their day of calamity.

Oba 1:14 Do not wait at the crossroads to annihilate their fugitives. Do not hand over their survivors on the day
of distress.

Oba 1:15 For the Day of Yahweh is near for all the nations. As you have done, so will it be done to you: your
deeds will recoil on your own head.

Oba 1:16 Just as you have drunk on my holy mountain, so will all the nations drink continually, they will drink,
will drink greedily, but they will be as though they had never been!

Oba 1:17 But on Mount Zion will be those who have escaped -it will be a sanctuary- and the House of Jacob will
recover what is rightfully theirs.

Oba 1:18 Then the House of Jacob will be a fire, the House of Joseph a flame, and the House of Esau like
stubble. They will set it alight and burn it up, and no one of the House of Esau will survive. Yahweh has spoken.
Oba 1:19 People from the Negeb will occupy the Mount of Esau, people from the lowlands the country of the
Philistines; they will occupy Ephraim and Samaria, and Benjamin will occupy Gilead.

Oba 1:20 The exiles of this army, the sons of Israel, will have the Canaanites’ land as far as Zarephthah, while
the exiles from Jerusalem now in Sepharad will have the cities of the Negeb.

Oba 1:21 Victorious, they will climb Mount Zion to rule over Mount Esau, and sovereignty will be Yahweh's!


Mic 1:1 The word of Yahweh which came to Micah of Moresheth during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz and
Hezekiah kings of Judah. His visions about Samaria and Jerusalem.

Mic 1 :2 Listen, all you peoples, attend, earth and everyone on it! Yahweh intends to give evidence against you,



the Lord, from his holy temple.

Mic 1 :3 For look, Yahweh is leaving his home, down he comes, he treads the heights of earth.

Mic 1 :4 Beneath him, the mountains melt, and valleys are torn open, like wax near a fire, like water pouring
down a slope.

Mic 1 :5 All this is because of the crime of Jacob, the sin of the House of Israel. What is the crime of Jacob? Is it
not Samaria? What is the sin of the House of Judah? Is it not Jerusalem?

Mic 1:6 So I shall make Samaria a ruin in the open country, a place for planting vines. I shall send her stones
rolling into the valley, until I have laid her foundations bare.

Mic 1 :7 All her images will be shattered, all her earnings consumed by fire. I shall leave all her idols derelict-
they were amassed out of prostitutes’ earnings and prostitutes’ earnings once more they will be.

Mic 1 :8 This is why I shall howl and wail, why I shall go barefoot and naked, why I shall howl like the jackals,
why I shall shriek like the owls;

Mic 1 :9 for there is no cure for the wounds that Yahweh inflicts: the blow falls on Judah, it falls on the gateway of
my people, on Jerusalem itself.

Mic 1:10 Do not announce it in Gath, in … shed no tears! In Beth-Leaphrah roll in the dust!

Mic 1:11 Sound the horn, inhabitant of Shaphir! She has not left her city, she who lives in Zaanan. Beth-Ezel is
torn from its foundations, from its strong supports.

Mic 1:12 What hope has she of happiness, she who lives in Maroth? Instead Yahweh sent down disaster on the
gateway of Jerusalem itself!

Mic 1:13 Harness the horse to the chariot, you inhabitant of Lachish! That is where the sin of the daughter of
Zion began; the crimes of Israel can be traced to you!

Mic 1:14 And so you must provide a dowry for Moresheth-Gath. Beth-Achzib will prove a disappointment for the
kings of Israel.

Mic 1:15 The plunderer will come to you again, you citizen of Mareshah! And into Adullam will vanish the glory
of Israel.

Mic 1:16 Off with your hair, shave your head, for the children that were your joy. Make yourselves bald like the
vulture, for they have left you for exile.

Mic 2:1 Disaster for those who plot evil, who lie in bed planning mischief! No sooner is it dawn than they do it,
since they have the power to do so.

Mic 2:2 Seizing the fields that they covet, they take over houses as well, owner and house they seize alike, the
man himself as well as his inheritance.

Mic 2:3 So Yahweh says this: Look, I am now plotting a disaster for this breed from which you will not extricate
your necks; you will not hold your heads up then, for the times will be disastrous indeed.

Mic 2:4 That day they will make a satire on you, they will strike up a dirge and say, “We have been stripped of
everything; my people’s land has been divided up, no one else can restore it to them, our fields have been
awarded to our despoiler”.

Mic 2:5 Because of this, you will have no one to measure out a share in Yahweh’s community.

Mic 2:6 “Do not drivel”, they drivel, “do not drivel like this! Disgrace will not overtake us!

Mic 2:7 “Can the House of Jacob be accursed? Has Yahweh grown short-tempered? Is that his way of going to
work? His prophecies can only be favourable for his people Israel!”.

Mic 2:8 But you are the ones who play the enemy to my people. From the inoffensive man you snatch his cloak,
on those who feel safe you inflict the damage of war.

Mic 2:9 My people’s women you evict from the homes they love, and deprive the children of my glory for ever,
Mic 2:10 saying, “Up and off with you! You can’t stay here!”. For a worthless thing you exact an extortionate
pledge.

Mic 2:11 If a man of the spirit came and invented this lie, “I prophesy wine and liquor for you”, he would be the
prophet for a people like this.

Mic 2:12 I shall assemble the whole of Jacob, I shall gather the remnant of Israel, I shall gather them together
like sheep in an enclosure. And like a flock within their fold, they will bleat far away from anyone,

Mic 2:13 their leader will break out first, then all break out through the gate and escape, with their king leading
the way and with Yahweh at their head.

Mic 3:1 Then I said, “Kindly listen, you leaders of the House of Jacob, you princes of the House of Israel. Surely
you are the ones who ought to know what is right,

Mic 3:2 and yet you hate what is good and love what is evil, skinning people alive, pulling the flesh off their
bones,

Mic 3:3 eating my people’s flesh, stripping off their skin, breaking up their bones, chopping them up small like
flesh for the pot, like meat in the stew-pan?”.

Mic 3:4 Then they will call to Yahweh, but he will not answer them. When the time comes he will hide his face
from them because of the crimes they have committed.



Mic 3:5 Yahweh says this against the prophets who lead my people astray: So long as they have something to
eat they cry “Peace'. But on anyone who puts nothing into their mouths they declare war.

Mic 3:6 And so, for you, night will be without vision and for you the darkness without divination. The sun will set
for the prophets, the daylight will go black above them.

Mic 3:7 Then the seers will be covered with shame, the diviners with confusion; they will all put their hands over
their mouths because there is no answer from God.

Mic 3:8 Not so with me, I am full of strength (full of Yahweh’s spirit), of the sense of right, of energy to accuse
Jacob of his crime and Israel of his sin.

Mic 3:9 Kindly listen to this, you leaders of the House of Jacob, you princes of the House of Israel, who detest
justice, wresting it from its honest course,

Mic 3:10 who build Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity!

Mic 3:1 1 Her leaders give verdicts for presents, her priests take a fee for their rulings, her prophets divine for
money and yet they rely on Yahweh! “Isn’t Yahweh among us?”. they say, “No disaster is going to overtake us”.

Mic 3:12 That is why, thanks to you, Zion will become ploughland, Jerusalem a heap of rubble and the Temple
Mount a wooded height.

Mic 4:1 But in days to come Yahweh’s Temple Mountain will tower above the mountains, rise higher than the
hills.

Mic 4:2 Then the peoples will stream to it, then many nations will come and say, “Come, we will go up to
Yahweh’s mountain, to the Temple of the God of Jacob, so that he may teach us his ways and we may walk in
his paths; for the Law issues from Zion and Yahweh’s word from Jerusalem”.

Mic 4:3 He will judge between many peoples and arbitrate between mighty nations. They will hammer their
swords into ploughshares and their spears into bill-hooks. Nation will not lift sword against nation or ever again
be trained to make war.

Mic 4:4 But each man will sit under his vine and fig tree with no one to trouble him. The mouth of Yahweh
Sabaoth has spoken.

Mic 4:5 For all peoples go forward, each in the name of its god, while we go forward in the name of Yahweh our
God for ever and ever.

Mic 4:6 That day — declares Yahweh- 1 shall gather in the lame and bring together the strays and those whom I
have treated harshly.

Mic 4:7 From the footsore I shall make a remnant, and from the far-flung a mighty nation. And Yahweh will reign
over them on Mount Zion thenceforth and for ever.

Mic 4:8 And to you, Tower of the Flock, Ophel of the daughter of Zion, to you your former sovereignty will return,
the royal power of the daughter of Jerusalem.

Mic 4:9 Why are you crying out now? Have you no king? Has your counsellor perished, for pangs to grip you
like those of a woman in labour?

Mic 4:10 Writhe in pain and cry aloud, daughter of Zion, like a woman in labour, for now you must leave the city
and camp in the open country; to Babylon you must go, and there you will be rescued; there Yahweh will ransom
you from the clutches of your enemies.

Mic 4:1 1 Now many nations have mustered against you. They say, “Let us desecrate her, let us gloat over Zion!”.
Mic 4:12 But they do not know Yahweh’s thoughts, they do not understand his design: he has collected them
like sheaves on the threshing-floor.

Mic 4:13 Start your threshing, daughter of Zion, for I shall make your horn like iron, I shall make your hooves like
bronze, so that you can crush many peoples. And you will devote what they have stolen to Yahweh, their wealth
to the Lord of the whole earth.

Mic 4:14 Now look to your fortifications, Fortress! They have laid siege to us; the ruler of Israel will be struck on
the cheek with a rod.

Mic 5:1 But you (Bethlehem) Ephrathah, the least of the clans of Judah, from you will come for me a future ruler
of Israel whose origins go back to the distant past, to the days of old.

Mic 5:2 Hence Yahweh will abandon them only until she who is in labour gives birth, and then those who survive
of his race will be reunited to the Israelites.

Mic 5:3 He will take his stand and he will shepherd them with the power of Yahweh, with the majesty of the
name of his God, and they will be secure, for his greatness will extend henceforth to the most distant parts of the
country.

Mic 5:4 He himself will be peace! Should the Assyrian invade our country, should he set foot in our land, we
shall raise seven shepherds against him, eight leaders of men;

Mic 5:5 they will shepherd Assyria with the sword, the country of Nimrod with naked blade. He will save us from
the Assyrian, should he invade our country, should he set foot inside our frontiers.

Mic 5:6 Then what is left of Jacob, surrounded by many peoples, will be like a dew from Yahweh, like showers
on the grass, which do not depend on human agency and are beyond human control.



Mic 5:7 Then what is left of Jacob, surrounded by many peoples, will be like a lion among the forest beasts, like
a fierce lion among flocks of sheep trampling as he goes, mangling his prey which no one takes from him.

Mic 5:8 You will be victorious over your foes and all your enemies will be torn to pieces.

Mic 5:9 When that day comes- declares Yahweh- 1 shall tear your horses away from you, I shall destroy your
chariots;

Mic 5:10 I shall tear the cities from your country, I shall overthrow all your fortresses;

Mic 5:11 I shall tear the spells out of your hands and you will have no more soothsayers;

Mic 5:12 I shall tear away your images and your sacred pillars from among you, and no longer will you worship
things which your own hands have made!

Mic 5:13 I shall uproot your sacred poles and shall destroy your cities!

Mic 5:14 In furious anger I shall wreak vengeance on the nations who have disobeyed me!

Mic 6:1 Now listen to what Yahweh says: “Stand up, state your case to the mountains and let the hills hear what
you have to say!”.

Mic 6:2 Listen, mountains, to the case as Yahweh puts it, give ear, you foundations of the earth, for Yahweh has
a case against his people and he will argue it with Israel.

Mic 6:3 “My people, what have I done to you, how have I made you tired of me? Answer me!

Mic 6:4 For I brought you up from Egypt, I ransomed you from the place of slave-labour and sent Moses, Aaron
and Miriam to lead you.

Mic 6:5 My people, please remember: what was Balak king of Moab’s plan and how did Balaam son of Beor
answer him? … from Shittim to Gilgal, for you to know Yahweh’s saving justice.

Mic 6:6 “With what shall I enter Yahweh’s presence and bow down before God All-high? Shall I enter with burnt
offerings, with calves one year old?

Mic 6:7 Will he be pleased with rams by the thousand, with ten thousand streams of oil? Shall I offer my eldest
son for my wrong-doing, the child of my own body for my sin?

Mic 6:8 “You have already been told what is right and what Yahweh wants of you. Only this, to do what is right,
to love loyalty and to walk humbly with your God”.

Mic 6:9 Yahweh’s voice! He thunders to the city, “Listen, tribe of assembled citizens!

Mic 6:10 Can I overlook the false measure, that abomination, the short bushel?

Mic 6:11 Can I connive at rigged scales and at the bag of fraudulent weights?

Mic 6:12 For the rich there are steeped in violence, and the citizens there are habitual liars.

Mic 6:13 “I myself have therefore begun to strike you down, to bring you to ruin for your sins.

Mic 6:14 You will eat but not be satisfied; you will store up but never keep safe; what you do keep safe I shall
hand over to the sword;

Mic 6:15 you will sow but will not reap, press the olive but will not rub yourself with oil, tread the grape but will
not drink the wine.

Mic 6:16 “For you keep the laws of Omri; what the House of Ahab did, you have done; by modelling yourselves
on their standards, you force me to make an appalling example of you and reduce your citizens to a laughing-
stock; hence you will endure the scorn of other peoples”.

Mic 7:1 How wretched I am, a harvester in summer time, like a gleaner at the vintage: not a single cluster to eat,
none of those early figs I love!

Mic 7:2 The faithful have vanished from the land: there is no one honest left. All of them are on the alert for
blood, every man hunting his brother with a net.

Mic 7:3 Their hands are adept at wrong-doing: the official makes his demands, the judge gives judgement for a
bribe, the man in power pronounces as he pleases.

Mic 7:4 The best of them is like a briar, the most honest of them like a thorn-hedge. Now from the north their
punishment approaches! That will be when they are confounded!

Mic 7:5 Trust no neighbour, put no confidence in a friend; do not open your mouth to the wife who shares your
bed.

Mic 7:6 For son insults father, daughter rebels against mother, daughter-in-law against mother-in-law; a
person’s enemies come from within the household itself.

Mic 7:7 But I shall look to Yahweh, my hope is in the God who will save me; my God will hear me.

Mic 7:8 Do not gloat over me, my enemy: though I have fallen, I shall rise; though I live in darkness, Yahweh is
my light.

Mic 7:9 I must endure Yahweh’s anger for I have sinned against him, until he takes up my cause and rights my
wrongs; he will bring me out into the light, and then I shall contemplate his saving justice.

Mic 7:10 When my enemy sees this, she will be covered with shame, having sneered, “Where is Yahweh your
God?”. This time, I shall be watching as she is trampled underfoot like mud in the streets.

Mic 7:1 1 That will be the day for rebuilding your walls! The day for expanding your frontiers!

Mic 7:12 The day when others come to you all the way from Assyria, from Egypt, from Tyre and all the way from



the Euphrates, from sea to sea, from the mountains to the mountains!

Mic 7:13 The earth will become a desert by reason of its inhabitants, in return for what they have done.

Mic 7:14 With shepherd’s crook lead your people to pasture, the flock that is your heritage, living confined in a
forest with meadow land all round. Let them graze in Bashan and Gilead as in the days of old!

Mic 7:15 As in the days when you came out of Egypt, grant us to see wonders!

Mic 7:16 The nations will see and be confounded in spite of all their power; they will put their hands over their
mouths, their ears will be deafened.

Mic 7:17 They will lick the dust like snakes, like reptiles that crawl on the earth. They will creep trembling out of
their lairs, in terror before you.

Mic 7:18 What god can compare with you for pardoning guilt and for overlooking crime? He does not harbour
anger for ever, since he delights in showing faithful love.

Mic 7:19 Once more have pity on us, tread down our faults; throw all our sins to the bottom of the sea.

Mic 7:20 Grant Jacob your faithfulness, and Abraham your faithful love, as you swore to our ancestors from the
days of long ago.

Nah 1:1 Prophecy about Nineveh. Book of the vision of Nahum of Elkosh.

Nah 1:2 Yahweh is a jealous and vengeful God, Yahweh takes vengeance, he is rich in wrath; Yahweh takes
vengeance on his foes, he stores up fury for his enemies.

Nah 1 :3 Yahweh is slow to anger but great in power, Yahweh never lets evil go unpunished. In storm and
whirlwind he takes his way, the clouds are the dust stirred up by his feet.

Nah 1 :4 He rebukes the sea, dries it up, and makes all the rivers run dry… . Bashan and Carmel wither, the
greenery of the Lebanon withers too.

Nah 1:5 The mountains tremble before him, the hills reel; the earth collapses before him, the world and all who
live in it.

Nah 1 :6 His fury — who can withstand it? Who can endure his burning wrath? His anger pours out like fire and
the rocks break apart before him.

Nah 1 :7 Yahweh is better than a fortress in time of distress; he recognises those who trust in him

Nah 1:8 even when the flood rushes on; he will make an end once and for all of those who defy him, and pursue

his foes into darkness.

Nah 1 :9 What are your thoughts about Yahweh? He it is who makes a final end: his adversaries will not rise up
a second time;

Nah 1:10 like a thicket of tangled brambles, like dry straw, they will be burnt up completely. To Assyria
Nah 1:11 From you has emerged someöne plotting evil against Yahweh, one of Belial’s counsellors. To Judah
Nah 1:12 Yahweh says this: Unopposed and many though they be, they will be cut down and pass away.
Though I have made you suffer, I shall make you suffer no more,

Nah 1:13 for now I shall break his yoke which presses hard on you and snap your chains. To the king of
Nineveh

Nah 1:14 As for you, this is Yahweh’s decree: You will have no heirs to your name, from the temple of your gods
I shall remove carved image and cast image, and I shall devastate your tomb, for you are accursed!

Nah 2:1 To Judah See on the mountains the feet of the herald! “Peace!”. he proclaims. Judah, celebrate your
feasts, carry out your vows, for Belial will never pass through you again; he has been utterly destroyed.

Nah 2:2 The destroyer has advanced on you, guarding the siege-works, watching the road, bracing himself,
mustering great strength!

Nah 2:3 (For Yahweh has restored the vine of Jacob, yes, the vine of Israel, although the plunderers had
plundered them, although they had snapped off their vine-shoots!)

Nah 2:4 The shields of his fighting men show red, his warriors are dressed in scarlet; the metal of the chariots
sparkles as he prepares for battle; the horsemen are impatient for action;

Nah 2:5 the chariots storm through the streets, jostling one another in the squares; they look like blazing flames,
like lightning they dash to and fro.

Nah 2:6 His captains are called out; stumbling as they go, they speed towards the wall, and the mantelet is put
in position.

Nah 2:7 The sluices of the River are opened, and the palace melts in terror.

Nah 2:8 Beauty is taken captive, carried away, her slave-girls moaning like doves

Nah 2:9 and beating their breasts. Nineveh is like a lake, whose waters are draining away. “Stop! Stop!”. But no
one turns back.

Nah 2:10 “Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold!”. There is no end to the treasure, a mass of everything you could
desire!

Nah 2:1 1 Ravaged, wrecked, ruined! Heart fails and knees give way, anguish is in the loins of all, and every
face grows pale!

Nah 2:12 Where is the lions’ den now, the cave of the lion’s whelps, where the lion and lioness walked with their



cubs and no one molested them,

Nah 2:13 where the lion would tear up food for his whelps and strangle the kill for his mates, where he filled his
caverns with prey and his lairs with spoil?

Nah 2:14 Look, I am against you!- declares Yahweh Sabaoth- 1 shall send your chariots up in smoke, and the
sword will devour your whelps; I shall cut short your depredations on earth, and the voices of your envoys will be
heard no more.

Nah 3:1 Disaster to the city of blood, packed throughout with lies, stuffed with booty, where plundering has no
end!

Nah 3:2 The crack of the whip! The rumble of wheels! Galloping horse, jolting chariot,

Nah 3:3 charging cavalry, flashing swords, gleaming spears, a mass of wounded, hosts of dead, countless
corpses; they stumble over corpses-

Nah 3:4 because of the countless whorings of the harlot, the graceful beauty, the cunning witch, who enslaved
nations by her harlotries and tribes by her spells.

Nah 3:5 Look, I am against you!- declares Yahweh Sabaoth- 1 shall lift your skirts as high as your face and show
your nakedness to the nations, your shame to the kingdoms.

Nah 3:6 I shall pelt you with filth, I shall shame you and put you in the pillory.

Nah 3:7 Then all who look at you will shrink from you and say, “Nineveh has been ruined!”. Who will mourn for
her? Where would I find people to comfort you?

Nah 3:8 Are you better off than No-Amon situated among rivers, her defences the seas, her rampart the waters?
Nah 3:9 In Ethiopia and Egypt lay her strength, and it was boundless; Put and the Libyans served in her army.
Nah 3:10 But she too went into exile, into captivity; her little ones too were dashed to pieces at every crossroad;
lots were drawn for her nobles, all her great men were put in chains.

Nah 3:1 1 You too will become drunk, you will go into hiding; you too will have to search for a refuge from the
enemy.

Nah 3:12 Your fortifications are all fig trees, with early ripening figs: as soon as they are shaken, they fall into
the mouth of the eater.

Nah 3:13 Look at your people: you are a nation of women! The gates of your country gape open to your
enemies; fire has devoured their bars!

Nah 3:14 Draw yourselves water for the siege, strengthen your fortifications! Into the mud with you, puddle the
clay, repair the brick-kiln!

Nah 3:15 There the fire will burn you up, the sword will cut you down. Make yourselves as numerous as locusts,
make yourselves as numerous as the hoppers,

Nah 3:16 let your commercial agents outnumber the stars of heaven,

Nah 3:17 your garrisons, like locusts, and your marshals, like swarms of hoppers! They settle on the walls when
the day is cold. The sun appears, the locusts spread their wings, they fly away, away they fly, no one knows
where. Alas,

Nah 3:18 your shepherds are asleep, king of Assyria, your bravest men slumber; your people are scattered on
the mountains with no one to gather them.

Nah 3:19 There is no remedy for your wound, your injury is past healing. All who hear the news of you clap their
hands at your downfall. For who has not felt your unrelenting cruelty?

Hab 1:1 The charge that Habakkuk the prophet received in a vision.

Hab 1 :2 How long, Yahweh, am I to cry for help while you will not listen; to cry, “Violence!”. in your ear while you
will not save?

Hab 1:3 Why do you make me see wrong-doing, why do you countenance oppression? Plundering and violence
confront me, contention and discord flourish.

Hab 1 :4 And so the law loses its grip and justice never emerges, since the wicked outwits the upright and so
justice comes out perverted.

Hab 1:5 Cast your eyes over the nations, look, and be amazed, astounded. For I am doing something in your
own days which you will not believe if you are told of it.

Hab 1:6 For look, I am stirring up the Chaldaeans, that fierce and fiery nation who march miles across country to
seize the homes of others.

Hab 1:7 They are dreadful and awesome, a law and authority to themselves.

Hab 1 :8 Their horses are swifter than leopards, fiercer than wolves at night; their horsemen gallop on, their
horsemen advance from afar, swooping like an eagle anxious to feed.

Hab 1 :9 They are all bent on violence, their faces scorching like an east wind; they scoop up prisoners like
sand.

Hab 1:10 They scoff at kings, they despise princes. They make light of all fortresses: they heap up earth and
take them.

Hab 1:11 Then the wind changes and is gone … Guilty is he who makes his strength his god.



Hab 1:12 Surely you, Yahweh, are from ancient times, my holy God, who never dies! Yahweh, you have
appointed him to execute judgement; O Rock, you have set him firm to punish.

Hab 1:13 Your eyes are too pure to rest on evil, you cannot look on at oppression. Why do you look on at those
who play the traitor, why say nothing while the wicked swallows someöne more upright than himself?

Hab 1:14 Why treat people like fish of the sea, like gliding creatures who have no leader?

Hab 1:15 They haul them all up on their hook, they catch them in their net, they sweep them up in their dragnet

and then make merry and rejoice.

Hab 1:16 And so they offer a sacrifice to their net, and burn incense to their dragnet, for by these they get a rich
living and live off the fat of the land.

Hab 1:17 Are they to go on emptying their net unceasingly, slaughtering the nations without pity?

Hab 2:1 I shall stand at my post, I shall station myself on my watch-tower, watching to see what he will say to

me, what answer he will make to my complaints.

Hab 2:2 Then Yahweh answered me and said, “Write the vision down, inscribe it on tablets to be easily read.
Hab 2:3 For the vision is for its appointed time, it hastens towards its end and it will not lie; although it may take
some time, wait for it, for come it certainly will before too long.

Hab 2:4 “You see, anyone whose heart is not upright will succumb, but the upright will live through faithfulness”.
Hab 2:5 Now, surely, wealth is treacherous! He is arrogant, for ever on the move, with appetite as large as
Sheol and as insatiable as Death, gathering in all the nations, and making a harvest of all peoples.

Hab 2:6 Are not the peoples all bound to satirise and make up cryptic riddles about him? As for instance:
Disaster to anyone who amasses goods not his (for how long?) and to anyone who weighs himself down with
goods taken in pledge!

Hab 2:7 Will not your creditors suddenly stand up, will not those who make you shiver wake up, and you will fall
a prey to them?

Hab 2:8 Since you have plundered many nations, all the nations that remain will plunder you, because of the
bloodshed and violence done to the country, to the city and to all who live in it.

Hab 2:9 Disaster to anyone who amasses ill-gotten gains for his house, so as to fix his nest on high and so
evade the reach of misfortune!

Hab 2:10 You have conspired to bring shame on your house: by overthrowing many peoples you have worked
your own ruin.

Hab 2:1 1 For the very stone will protest from the wall, and the beam will respond from the framework.

Hab 2:12 Disaster to anyone who builds a town with bloodshed and founds a city on wrong-doing!

Hab 2:13 Is it not thanks to Yahweh Sabaoth that the peoples’ toil is fuel for the fire, and the nations’ labour
came to nothing?

Hab 2:14 But the earth will be full of the knowledge of the glory of Yahweh as the waters cover the depths of the
sea.

Hab 2:15 Disaster to anyone who makes his neighbours drink, pouring out his poison until they are drunk, so
that he can see them naked!

Hab 2:16 You are full of shame, not glory! Your turn now to drink and show your foreskin. The cup in Yahweh’s
right hand comes round to you, and disgrace will overshadow your glory.

Hab 2:17 For the violence done to the Lebanon will overwhelm you and the massacre of animals will terrify you,
because of the bloodshed and violence done to the country, to the city and to all who live in it. Disaster to
anyone who says to the log, “Wake up!”, to the dumb stone, “On your feet!”. (This is the prophecy!) Look, he is
encased in gold and silver, -but not a breath of life inside it!

Hab 2:18 What use is a sculpted image that a sculptor should make it? - a metal image, a lying instructor! And
why does the image-maker put his trust in it, that he should make dumb idols?

Hab 2:19

Hab 2:20 But Yahweh is in his holy Temple: let the whole earth be silent before him.

Hab 3:1 A prayer of the prophet Habakkuk; tone as for dirges.

Hab 3:2 Yahweh, I have heard of your renown; your work, Yahweh, inspires me with dread. Make it live again in
our time, make it known in our time; in wrath remember mercy.

Hab 3:3 Eloah comes from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran. Pause His majesty covers the
heavens, and his glory fills the earth.

Hab 3:4 His brightness is like the day, rays flash from his hands, that is where his power lies hidden.

Hab 3:5 Pestilence goes before him and Plague follows close behind.

Hab 3:6 When he stands up, he makes the earth tremble, with his glance he makes the nations quake. And the
eternal mountains are dislodged, the everlasting hills sink down, his pathway from of old.

Hab 3:7 I saw the tents of Cushan in trouble, the tent-curtains of Midian shuddering.

Hab 3:8 Yahweh, are you enraged with the rivers, are you angry with the sea, that you should mount your
chargers, your rescuing chariots?



Hab 3:9 You uncover your bow, and give the string its fill of arrows. PauseYou drench the soil with torrents;

Hab 3:10 the mountains see you and tremble, great floods sweep by, the abyss roars aloud, lifting high its
waves.

Hab 3:1 1 Sun and moon stay inside their dwellings, they flee at the light of your arrows, at the flash of your
lightning-spear.

Hab 3:12 In rage you stride across the land, in anger you trample the nations.

Hab 3:13 You marched to save your people, to save your anointed one; you wounded the head of the house of
the wicked, laid bare the foundation to the rock. Pause

Hab 3:14 With your shafts you pierced the leader of his warriors who stormed out with shouts of joy to scatter
us, as if they meant to devour some poor wretch in their lair.

Hab 3:15 With your horses you trampled through the sea, through the surging abyss!

Hab 3:16 When I heard, I trembled to the core, my lips quivered at the sound; my bones became disjointed and
my legs gave way beneath me. Calmly I await the day of anguish which is dawning on the people now attacking
us.

Hab 3:17 (For the fig tree is not to blossom, nor will the vines bear fruit, the olive crop will disappoint and the
fields will yield no food; the sheep will vanish from the fold; no cattle in the stalls.)

Hab 3:18 But I shall rejoice in Yahweh, I shall exult in God my Saviour.

Hab 3:19 Yahweh my Lord is my strength, he will make my feet as light as a doe’s, and set my steps on the
heights. For the choirmaster; on stringed instruments.

Zep 1:1 The word of Yahweh which was addressed to Zephaniah son of Cushi, son of Gedaliah, son of
Amariah, son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah.

Zep 1 :2 I shall sweep away everything off the face of the earth, declares Yahweh.

Zep 1 :3 I shall sweep away humans and animals, the birds of the air and the fish of the sea, I shall topple the
wicked and wipe all people off the face of the earth -declares Yahweh.

Zep 1 :4 I shall raise my hand against Judah and against all who live in Jerusalem, and from this place I will wipe
out Baal’s remnant, the very name of his priests,

Zep 1 :5 and those who prostrate themselves on the roofs before the array of heaven, and those who prostrate
themselves before Yahweh but swear by Milcom,

Zep 1 :6 and those who have turned their back on Yahweh, who do not seek Yahweh and do not consult him.
Zep 1 :7 Silence before Lord Yahweh, for the Day of Yahweh is near! Yahweh has prepared a sacrifice, he has
consecrated his guests.

Zep 1:8 On the Day of Yahweh’s sacrifice, I shall punish the courtiers, the royal princes and all who dress in
outlandish clothes.

Zep 1 :9 On that day I shall punish all who go up the Step and fill the Temple of their lords, with violence and
deceit.

Zep 1:10 On that Day — declares Yahweh — uproar will be heard from the Fish Gate, wailing from the New
Quarter and a great crash from the hills.

Zep 1:11 Wail, you who live in the Hollow, for it is all over with the merchants, all the money-bags have been
wiped out!

Zep 1:12 When that time comes I shall search Jerusalem by lamplight and punish the men stagnating over the
remains of their wine, who say in their hearts, “Yahweh can do nothing, either good or bad”.

Zep 1:13 For this, their wealth will be looted and their houses laid in ruins; they will build houses but not live in
them, they will plant vineyards but not drink their wine.

Zep 1:14 The great Day of Yahweh is near, near, and coming with great speed. How bitter the sound of the Day
of Yahweh, the Day when the warrior shouts his cry of war.

Zep 1:15 That Day is a day of retribution, a day of distress and tribulation, a day of ruin and of devastation, a
day of darkness and gloom, a day of cloud and thick fog,

Zep 1:16 a day of trumpet blast and battle cry against fortified town and high corner-tower.

Zep 1:17 I shall bring such distress on humanity that they will grope their way like the blind for having sinned
against Yahweh. Their blood will be poured out like mud, yes, their corpses like dung;

Zep 1:18 nor will their silver or gold be able to save them. On the Day of Yahweh’s anger, by the fire of his
jealousy, the whole earth will be consumed. For he will destroy, yes, annihilate everyone living on earth.

Zep 2:1 Gather together, gather together, nations without shame,

Zep 2:2 before you are dispersed like chaff which disappears in a day; before Yahweh’s burning anger
overtakes you (before the Day of Yahweh’s anger overtakes you).

Zep 2:3 Seek Yahweh, all you humble of the earth, who obey his commands. Seek uprightness, seek humility:
you may perhaps find shelter on the Day of Yahweh’s anger.

Zep 2:4 For Gaza will be abandoned and Ashkelon reduced to ruins; Ashdod will be driven out in broad daylight
and Ekron uprooted.



Zep 2:5 Disaster to the members of the coastal league, to the nation of the Cherethites! This is the word of
Yahweh against you: I shall subdue you, land of the Philistines, I shall destroy you till there are no inhabitants
left;

Zep 2:6 and the coastal league will be reduced to pasture land, to grazing grounds for shepherds and folds for
sheep;

Zep 2:7 and the league will belong to the remnant of the House of Judah; they will pasture their flocks there, at
night they will rest in the houses of Ashkelon; for, when Yahweh their God has punished them, he will restore
their fortunes.

Zep 2:8 I have heard the taunt of Moab and the insults of the Ammonites, as they taunted my people and
boasted of their own domains.

Zep 2:9 For this, as I live — declares Yahweh Sabaoth, God of Israel — Moab will become like Sodom and the
Ammonites like Gomorrah: a realm of nettles, a heap of salt, a desolation for ever. What is left of my people will
plunder them, the survivors of my nation will take their heritage.

Zep 2:10 This will be the price of their pride for having taunted and boasted over the people of Yahweh
Sabaoth.

Zep 2:1 1 Yahweh will be fearsome to them, for he will scatter all the gods of the earth, and they will bow down
to him, each from his own place — all the islands of the nations.

Zep 2:12 You Ethiopians too will be run through by my sword.

Zep 2:13 He will raise his hand against the north and bring Assyria down in ruins; he will make Nineveh a waste,
as dry as a desert.

Zep 2:14 Flocks will rest inside there, so will wild animals; pelican and porcupine will nest round her cornices at
night; the owl will hoot at the window and the raven croak on the doorstep — for the cedar has been torn down.
Zep 2:15 This is what the city will be like, once living happy and carefree and thinking to itself, “I have no rival —
not I!”. And what will it be now? A ruin, a lair for wild beasts to rest in, and everyone who passes by will whistle
and throw up his hands.

Zep 3:1 Disaster to the rebellious, the befouled, the tyrannical city!

Zep 3:2 She has not listened to the call, she has not bowed to correction, she has not trusted in Yahweh, she
has not drawn near to her God.

Zep 3:3 The rulers she has are roaring lions, her judges are wolves of the wastelands which leave nothing over
for the morning,

Zep 3:4 her prophets are braggarts, impostors, her priests have profaned what is holy and violated the Law.

Zep 3:5 Yahweh the Upright is in her, he does no wrong; morning by morning he gives judgement, each dawn
unfailingly (but the wrong-doer knows no shame).

Zep 3:6 I have exterminated the nations, their corner-towers lie in ruins; I have emptied their streets, no one
walks through them; their cities have been destroyed and are now deserted and unpeopled.

Zep 3:7 I thought, “At least you will fear me, at least you will bow to correction”, and none of the punishments I
brought on them will disappear from their view. But no, it only made them more anxious to do whatever was
corrupt.

Zep 3:8 So wait for me — declares Yahweh — for the day when I rise as accuser, for I am determined to gather
the nations, to assemble the kingdoms, and on you to vent my fury, the whole heat of my anger (for the whole
earth will be devoured by the fire of my jealousy).

Zep 3:9 Yes, then I shall purge the lips of the peoples, so that all may invoke the name of Yahweh and serve
him shoulder to shoulder.

Zep 3:10 From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, my suppliants will bring me tribute.

Zep 3:1 1 When that Day comes you will never again be ashamed of all the deeds with which you once rebelled
against me, for I shall rid you of those who exult in your pride; never again will you strut on my holy mountain.
Zep 3:12 But in you I shall leave surviving a humble and lowly people,

Zep 3:13 and those who are left in Israel will take refuge in the name of Yahweh. They will do no wrong, will tell
no lies; nor will a deceitful tongue be found in their mouths. But they will be able to graze and rest with no one to
alarm them.

Zep 3:14 Shout for joy, daughter of Zion, Israel, shout aloud! Rejoice, exult with all your heart, daughter of
Jerusalem!

Zep 3:15 Yahweh has repealed your sentence; he has turned your enemy away. Yahweh is king among you,
Israel, you have nothing more to fear.

Zep 3:16 When that Day comes, the message for Jerusalem will be: Zion, have no fear, do not let your hands
fall limp.

Zep 3:17 Yahweh your God is there with you, the warrior-Saviour. He will rejoice over you with happy song, he
will renew you by his love, he will dance with shouts of joy for you,

Zep 3:18 as on a day of festival. I have taken away your misfortune, no longer need you bear the disgrace of it.



Zep 3:19 I am taking action here and now against your oppressors. When that time comes I will rescue the
lame, and gather the strays, and I will win them praise and renown when I restore their fortunes.

Zep 3:20 At that time I shall be your guide, at the time when I gather you in, I shall give you praise and renown
among all the peoples of the earth when I restore your fortunes under your own eyes, declares Yahweh.

Hag 1:1 In the second year of King Darius, on the first day of the sixth month, the word of Yahweh was
addressed through the prophet Haggai to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel governor of Judah and to Joshua son of
Jehozadak the high priest as follows,

Hag 1:2 “Yahweh Sabaoth says this, ‘This people says: The time has not yet come to rebuild the Temple of
Yahweh’”.

Hag 1:3 (And the word of Yahweh was addressed through the prophet Haggai, as follows,)

Hag 1 :4 “Is this a time for you to live in your panelled houses, when this House lies in ruins?

Hag 1:5 So now, Yahweh Sabaoth says this, ‘Think carefully about your behaviour.

Hag 1:6 You have sown much and harvested little; you eat but never have enough, drink but never have your
fill, put on clothes but feel no warmth. The wage-earner gets his wages only to put them in a bag with a hole in
it.”

Hag 1:7 Yahweh Sabaoth says this, ‘Think carefully about your behaviour.

Hag 1 :8 Go up into the hills, fetch timber and rebuild the House; and I shall take pleasure in it and manifest my
glory there — Yahweh says.

Hag 1:9 The abundance you expected proved to be little. When you brought the harvest in, I blasted it. And
why? - Yahweh Sabaoth declares. Because while my House lies in ruins, each of you is busy with his own
house.

Hag 1:10 That is why the sky has withheld the rain and the earth withheld its yield.

Hag 1:11 I have called down drought on land and hills, on grain, on new wine, on olive oil and on all the produce
of the ground, on humans and animals and all your labours’”.

Hag 1:12 Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Joshua son of Jehozadak the high priest and the entire remnant of the
people, paid attention to the voice of Yahweh their God and to the words of the prophet Haggai, which Yahweh
their God had sent him to deliver. And the people were filled with fear before Yahweh.

Hag 1:13 Haggai, the messenger of Yahweh, then passed on Yahweh’s message to the people, “I am with you
— declares Yahweh”.

Hag 1:14 And Yahweh roused the spirit of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel governor of Judah, the spirit of Joshua
son of Jehozadak the high priest and the spirit of the entire remnant of the people; they came and set to work in
the Temple of Yahweh Sabaoth, their God.

Hag 1:15 This was on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month. In the second year of King Darius,

Hag 2:1 on the twenty-first day of the seventh month, the word of Yahweh was addressed through the prophet
Haggai, as follows,

Hag 2:2 “You are to speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel governor of Judah, to Joshua son of Jehozadak the
high priest and to the remnant of the people. Say this,

Hag 2:3 ‘Is there anyone left among you who saw this Temple in its former glory? And how does it look to you
now? Does it not seem as though there is nothing there?

Hag 2:4 But take courage now, Zerubbabell-Yahweh declares. Courage, Joshua son of Jehozadak high priest!
Courage, all you people of the countryl-Yahweh declares. To work! I am with you — Yahweh Sabaoth declares-
Hag 2:5 and my spirit is present among you. Do not be afraid!

Hag 2:6 For Yahweh Sabaoth says this: A little while now, and I shall shake the heavens and the earth, the sea
and the dry land.

Hag 2:7 I shall shake all the nations, and the treasures of all the nations will flow in, and I shall fill this Temple
with glory, says Yahweh Sabaoth.

Hag 2:8 Mine is the silver, mine the gold!-Yahweh Sabaoth declares.

Hag 2:9 The glory of this new Temple will surpass that of the old, says Yahweh Sabaoth, and in this place I shall
give peace — Yahweh Sabaoth declares’”.

Hag 2:10 On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of Yahweh was
addressed to the prophet Haggai as follows,

Hag 2:1 1 “Yahweh Sabaoth says this, ‘Ask the priests to give a ruling on this:

Hag 2:12 If someöne is carrying consecrated meat in the fold of his gown and allows the fold to touch bread,
broth, wine, oil or food of any kind, will that become holy?’”. The priests replied, “No”.

Hag 2:13 Haggai then said, “If anyone rendered unclean by contact with a corpse touches any of these things,
will that become unclean?”. The priests replied, “It will become unclean”.

Hag 2:14 Haggai then spoke out. “It is the same with this people”, he said, “the same with this nation, in my view
— Yahweh declares — the same with everything they turn their hands to; and whatever they offer here is unclean.
Hag 2:15 “So now think carefully, today and henceforth: before one stone had been laid on another in the



sanctuary of Yahweh,

Hag 2:16 what state were you in? You would come to a twenty-measure heap and find only ten; you would
come to a vat to draw fifty measures and find only twenty.

Hag 2:17 Everything you turned your hands to, I struck with wind-blast, mildew and hail, and still you would not
return to me — Yahweh declares.

Hag 2:18 So think carefully, today and henceforth (from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, from the day
the foundation of the sanctuary of Yahweh was laid, think carefully)

Hag 2:19 if seed-corn is still short in the barn, and if vine and fig tree, pomegranate and olive tree still bear no
fruit. “From today onwards I intend to bless you”.

Hag 2:20 On the twenty-fourth day of the month the word of Yahweh was addressed a second time to Haggai,
as follows,

Hag 2:21 “Speak to Zerubbabel governor of Judah. Say this, ‘I am going to shake the heavens and the earth.
Hag 2:22 I shall overturn the thrones of kingdoms and destroy the power of the kings of the nations. I shall
overthrow the chariots and their crews; horses and their riders will fall, every one to the sword of his comrade.
Hag 2:23 When that day comes — Yahweh Sabaoth declares — 1 shall take you, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel my
servant — Yahweh declares — and make you like a signet ring. For I have chosen you — Yahweh Sabaoth
declares’”.

Zee 1:1 In the second year of Darius, in the eighth month, the word of Yahweh was addressed to the prophet
Zechariah (son of Berechiah), son of Iddo, as follows,

Zee 1 :2 “Yahweh was deeply angry with your ancestors.

Zee 1:3 So say this to them, ‘Yahweh Sabaoth says this: Return to me — Yahweh Sabaoth declares — and I will
return to you, says Yahweh Sabaoth.

Zee 1 :4 Do not be like your ancestors when the prophets in the past cried to them: Yahweh Sabaoth says this:
Turn back from your evil ways and evil deeds — they would not listen or pay attention to me — Yahweh declares.
Zee 1 :5 Where are your ancestors now? And the prophets, do they live for ever?

Zee 1:6 But did not my words and statutes, with which I had charged my servants the prophets, overtake your
ancestors just the same?’”. So they repented and said, “Yahweh Sabaoth has treated us as he resolved to do,
and as our ways and deeds deserved”.

Zee 1 :7 On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month (the month of Shebat), in the second year of Darius, the
word of Yahweh was addressed to the prophet Zechariah (son of Berechiah), son of Iddo, as follows,

Zee 1:8 “I had a vision during the night. There was a man riding a red horse standing among the deep-rooted
myrtles; behind him were other horses-red, chestnut and white.

Zee 1 :9 I said, ‘What are these, my lord?’. And the angel who was talking to me said, ‘I will show you what they
are’.

Zee 1:10 The man standing among the myrtles then replied, ‘Those are they whom Yahweh has sent to patrol
the world’.

Zee 1:11 They reported to the angel of Yahweh as he stood among the myrtles, ‘We have been patrolling the
world, and indeed the whole world is still and at peace’.

Zee 1:12 The angel of Yahweh then spoke and said, ‘Yahweh Sabaoth, how long will you wait before taking pity
on Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, on which you have inflicted your anger for the past seventy years?’.

Zee 1:13 Yahweh then replied with kind and comforting words to the angel who was talking to me.

Zee 1:14 The angel who was talking to me then said to me, ‘Make this proclamation: Yahweh Sabaoth says
this: I am burning with jealousy for Jerusalem and Zion

Zee 1:15 but am deeply angry with the nations now at ease; before, I was only mildly angry, but they contributed
to the disaster.

Zee 1:16 So now Yahweh says this: In compassion I have returned to Jerusalem; my Temple will be rebuilt
there — Yahweh Sabaoth declares — and the measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.

Zee 1:17 Make this proclamation too: Yahweh Sabaoth says this: My cities are once more to be very
prosperous. Yahweh will comfort Zion once again, and again make Jerusalem his choice’”.

Zee 2:1 Then, raising my eyes, I had a vision. It was this: There were four horns.

Zee 2:2 I said to the angel who was talking to me, “What are these?”. He said to me, “These are the horns which
scattered Judah (Israel) and Jerusalem”.

Zee 2:3 Yahweh then showed me four smiths.

Zee 2:4 And I said, “What are these coming to do?”. He said to me, “(Those horns scattered Judah so completely
that no one dared to raise his head; but) these have come to terrify them, to throw down the horns of the nations
who raised their horns over the land of Judah to scatter it”.

Zee 2:5 Then, raising my eyes, I had a vision. There was a man with a measuring line in his hand.

Zee 2:6 I asked him, “Where are you going?”. He said, “To measure Jerusalem, to calculate her width and length”.
Zee 2:7 And then, while the angel who was talking to me walked away, another angel came out to meet him.



Zee 2:8 He said to him, “Run, and tell that young man this, ‘Jerusalem is to remain unwalled, because of the
great number of men and cattle inside.

Zee 2:9 For I — Yahweh declares — shall be a wall of fire all round her and I shall be the Glory within her’”.

Zee 2:10 Look out! Look out! Flee from the land of the north — Yahweh declares- for I have scattered you to the
four winds of heaven — Yahweh declares.

Zee 2:1 1 Look out! Make your escape, Zion, now living with the daughter of Babylon!

Zee 2:12 For Yahweh Sabaoth says this, since the Glory commissioned me, about the nations who plundered
you, “Whoëver touches you touches the apple of my eye.

Zee 2:13 Now look, I shall wave my hand over them and they will be plundered by those whom they have
enslaved”. Then you will know that Yahweh Sabaoth has sent me!

Zee 2:14 Sing, rejoice, daughter of Zion, for now I am coming to live among you -Yahweh declares!

Zee 2:15 And on that day many nations will be converted to Yahweh. Yes, they will become his people, and they
will live among you. Then you will know that Yahweh Sabaoth has sent me to you!

Zee 2:16 Yahweh will take possession of Judah, his portion in the Holy Land, and again make Jerusalem his
choice.

Zee 2:17 Let all people be silent before Yahweh, now that he is stirring from his holy Dwelling!

Zee 3:1 He then showed me the high priest Joshua, standing before the angel of Yahweh, with Satan standing
on his right to accuse him.

Zee 3:2 The angel of Yahweh said to Satan, “May Yahweh rebuke you, Satan! May Yahweh rebuke you, since
he has made Jerusalem his choice. Is not this man a brand snatched from the fire?”.

Zee 3:3 Now Joshua was dressed in dirty clothes as he stood before the angel.

Zee 3:4 The latter then spoke as follows to those who were standing before him, “Take off his dirty clothesand
dress him in splendid robes

Zee 3:5 and put a clean turban on his head”. So they put a clean turban on his head and dressed him in clean
clothes, while the angel of Yahweh stood byand said, “You see, I have taken your guilt away”.

Zee 3:6 The angel of Yahweh then made this declaration to Joshua,

Zee 3:7 “Yahweh Sabaoth says this, ‘If you walk in my ways and keep my ordinances, you shall govern my
house, you shall watch over my courts, and I will give you free access among those in attendance here.

Zee 3:8 “So listen, High Priest Joshua, you and the colleagues over whom you preside — for they are an omen
of things to come — for now I shall bring in my servant the Branch, and I shall remove this country’s guilt in a
single day.

Zee 3:9 For this is the stone which I have put before Joshua, a stone on which are seven eyes; and I myself
shall cut the inscription on it — Yahweh Sabaoth declares’.

Zee 3:10 On that day — Yahweh Sabaoth declares — invite each other to come under your vine and your fig
tree’”.

Zee 4:1 The angel who was talking to me came back and roused me as though rousing someöne who was
asleep.

Zee 4:2 And he asked me, “What do you see?”. I replied, “As I look, there is a lamp-stand entirely of gold with a
bowl at the top of it; it holds seven lamps, with seven openings for the lamps on it.

Zee 4:3 By it are two olive trees, one to the right and the other to the left”.

Zee 4:4 I then said to the angel who was talking to me, “What are those things, my lord?”.

Zee 4:5 The angel who was talking to me replied, “Do you not know what they are?”. I said, “No, my lord”.

Zee 4:6 He then gave me this answer, “These seven are the eyes of Yahweh, which range over the whole world”.
Zee 4:7 “What are you, great mountain? Beside Zerubbabel you shall become a plain! He will bring out the
keystone while it is cheered with Hurrah! Hurrah!”.

Zee 4:8 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Zee 4:9 “The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this Temple; his hands will finish it. (Then you will
know that Yahweh Sabaoth has sent me to you.)

Zee 4: 1 0 A day of little things, no doubt, but who would dare despise it? How they will rejoice when they see the
chosen stone in the hands of Zerubbabel!”.

Zee 4:1 1 Then I went on to ask him, “What is the meaning of these two olive trees, to right and left of the lamp-
stand?”.

Zee 4: 1 2 (And I went on to ask him further, “What is the meaning of the two olive branches discharging oil
through the two golden openings?')

Zee 4:13 He replied, “Do you not know what they are?”. I said, “No, my lord”.

Zee 4:14 He said, “These are the two anointed ones in attendance on the Lord of the whole world. This is the
word of Yahweh with regard to Zerubbabel, “Not by might and not by power, but by my spirit” — says Yahweh
Sabaoth.

Zee 5:1 Again raising my eyes, I had a vision. There was a flying scroll.



Zee 5:2 The angel who was talking to me said, “What do you see?”. I replied, “I see a flying scroll; it is twenty
cubits long and ten cubits wide”.

Zee 5:3 He then said to me, “This is God’s curse sweeping across the face of the whole country; for, according
to what it says on one side, every thief will be banished and, according to what it says on the other, everyone
who commits perjury in my name will be banished from it.

Zee 5:4 I am going to release it — Yahweh Sabaoth declares — for it to enter the house of the thief and of
anyone who commits perjury in my name, for it to settle deep within his house and consume it, timber, stone and
all”.

Zee 5:5 The angel who was talking to me appeared and said to me, “Raise your eyes, and see what this is,
going along”.

Zee 5:6 I said, “What is it?”. He said, “It is a bushel measure going along”. He went on, “This is their guilt
throughout the country”.

Zee 5:7 At this, a disc of lead was raised, and I saw a woman sitting inside the barrel.

Zee 5:8 He said, “This is Wickedness”. And he rammed her back into the barrel and jammed its mouth shut with
the mass of lead.

Zee 5:9 I raised my eyes, and there were two women appearing. The wind caught their wings — they had wings
like a stork's; they raised the barrel midway between earth and heaven.

Zee 5:10 I then said to the angel who was talking to me, “Where are they taking the barrel?”.

Zee 5:1 1 He replied, “To build a temple for it in the land of Shinar and make a pedestal on which to put it”.

Zee 6:1 Again I raised my eyes, and this is what I saw: four chariots coming out between two mountains, and
the mountains were mountains of bronze.

Zee 6:2 The first chariot had red horses, the second chariot had black horses,

Zee 6:3 the third chariot had white horses and the fourth chariot had vigorous, piebald horses.

Zee 6:4 I asked the angel who was talking to me, “What are these, my lord?”.

Zee 6:5 The angel replied, “They are the four winds of heaven now leaving, after attending the Lord of the whole
world.

Zee 6:6 The black horses are leaving for the land of the north; the white are following them, and the piebald are
leaving for the land of the south”.

Zee 6:7 They came out vigorously, eager to patrol the world. He said to them, “Go and patrol the world”. And
they patrolled the world.

Zee 6:8 He called to me and said, “Look, the ones going to the land of the north brought my spirit to rest on the
land of the north”.

Zee 6:9 Then the word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Zee 6:10 “Collect silver and gold from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah, then (you yourself go the
same day) go to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah, who has arrived from Babylon.

Zee 6:1 1 Then, taking the silver and gold, make a crown and place it on the head of the high priest Joshua son
of Jehozadak.

Zee 6:12 And say this to him, ‘Yahweh Sabaoth says this: Here is a man whose name is Branch; where he is,
there will be a branching out (and he will rebuild Yahweh’s sanctuary).

Zee 6:13 Yes, he is the one who will rebuild Yahweh’s sanctuary; he will wear the royal insignia and sit on his
throne and govern, with a priest on his right. Perfect peace will reign between these two.

Zee 6:14 And the crown will serve Heldai, Tobijah, Jedaiah and the son of Zephaniah as a memorial of favour in
Yahweh’s sanctuary.

Zee 6: 1 5 And those now far away will come and work on the building of Yahweh’s sanctuary’. “Then you will
know that Yahweh Sabaoth has sent me to you. It will happen if you diligently obey the voice of Yahweh your
God”.

Zee 7:1 In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of Yahweh was addressed to Zechariah on the fourth day of
the ninth month, the month of Chislev.

Zee 7:2 Bethel sent Sharezer with a deputation to entreat Yahweh’s favour

Zee 7:3 and to ask the priests in the Temple of Yahweh Sabaoth and the prophets, “Ought I to go on mourning
and fasting in the fifth month as I have been doing for so many years past?”.

Zee 7:4 Then the word of Yahweh Sabaoth was addressed to me as follows,

Zee 7:5 “Say to all the people of the country and to the priests, ‘While you have been fasting and mourning in
the fifth and seventh months for the past seventy years, have you really been fasting for my sake?

Zee 7:6 And when you were eating and drinking, were you not eating and drinking for your own sake?

Zee 7:7 Do you not know the words which Yahweh proclaimed through the prophets in the past, when
Jerusalem was inhabited and secure, as were her surrounding towns, and when the Negeb and the lowlands
were inhabited?’”. (

Zee 7:8 The word of Yahweh was addressed to Zechariah as follows,



Zee 7:9 “Yahweh Sabaoth says this.) He said, ‘Apply the law fairly, and show faithful love and compassion
towards one another.

Zee 7:10 Do not oppress the widow and the orphan, the foreigner and the poor, and do not secretly plan evil
against one another’.

Zee 7:1 1 But they would not listen; they turned a rebellious shoulder; they stopped their ears rather than hear;
Zee 7:12 they made their hearts adamant rather than listen to the teaching and the words that Yahweh Sabaoth
had sent — by his spirit — through the prophets in the past; and consequently the fury of Yahweh Sabaoth
overtook them.

Zee 7:13 And so, since when he called they would not listen, ‘I would not listen when they called’, says Yahweh
Sabaoth,

Zee 7:14 ‘but scattered them among all the nations unknown to them. Hence, after they had gone, the country
was deserted, and no one came or went. They had turned a land of delights into a desert’”.

Zee 8:1 The word of Yahweh Sabaoth came as follows:

Zee 8:2 Yahweh Sabaoth says this: I have been burning with jealousy for Zion, with furious jealousy for her
sake.

Zee 8:3 Yahweh says this: I am coming back to Zion and shall live in the heart of Jerusalem. Jerusalem will be
called Faithful City and the mountain of Yahweh Sabaoth, the Holy Mountain.

Zee 8:4 Yahweh Sabaoth says this: Aged men and women once again will sit in the squares of Jerusalem, each
with a stick to lean on because of their great age.

Zee 8:5 And the squares of the city will be full of boys and girls playing there.

Zee 8:6 Yahweh Sabaoth says this: If this seems a miracle to the remnant of this people (in those days), will it
seem one to me? declares Yahweh.

Zee 8:7 Yahweh Sabaoth says this: Look, I shall rescue my people from the countries of the east and from the
countries of the west.

Zee 8:8 I shall bring them back to live in the heart of Jerusalem, and they will be my people and I shall be their
God, faithful and just.

Zee 8:9 “Yahweh Sabaoth says this, ‘Take heart, you who today hear these promises uttered by the prophets
since the day when the foundations of the Temple of Yahweh Sabaoth were laid, that the sanctuary would
indeed be rebuilt.

Zee 8:10 For up to now, men were not paid their wages and nothing was paid for the animals either; and it has
not been safe for anyone to come and go, because of the enemy, since I had set each one against everyone
else.

Zee 8:1 1 But from now on, I shall not treat the remnant of this people as I have treated them in time past —
declares Yahweh Sabaoth.

Zee 8:12 Now they will sow in peace; the vine will give its fruit, the soil will give its produce and heaven will give
its dew. I shall bestow all these on the remnant of this people.

Zee 8:13 Just as once you were a curse among the nations, House of Judah and House of Israel, so now I shall
save you, and you will be a blessing. Do not be afraid. Take heart!’.

Zee 8:14 “For Yahweh Sabaoth says this, ‘Just as I resolved to ill-treat you when your ancestors provoked me to
anger and did not relent — says Yahweh Sabaoth-

Zec 8:15 so now I have changed my mind and intend to treat Jerusalem and the House of Judah well. Do not be
afraid!

Zee 8: 1 6 ‘These are the things that you must do. Speak the truth to one another; at your gates, administer fair
judgement conducive to peace;

Zee 8:17 do not secretly plot evil against one another; do not love perjury; since I hate all this — Yahweh
declares’. ’

Zee 8:18 The word of Yahweh Sabaoth was addressed to me as follows:

Zee 8:19 “Yahweh Sabaoth says this, ‘The fast of the fourth month, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh
and the fast of the tenth are to become glad, joyful, happy festivals for the House of Judah. So love truth and
peace!’”.

Zee 8:20 “Yahweh Sabaoth says this, ‘In the future, peoples and citizens of many cities will come;

Zee 8:21 and citizens of one city will go to the next and say: We must certainly go to entreat Yahweh’s favour
and seek out Yahweh Sabaoth; I am going myself.

Zee 8:22 Yes, many peoples and great nations will seek out Yahweh Sabaoth in Jerusalem and entreat
Yahweh’s favour’.

Zee 8:23 “Yahweh Sabaoth says this, ‘In those days, ten men from nations of every language will take a Jew by
the sleeve and say: We want to go with you, since we have learnt that God is with you’”.

Zee 9:1 A proclamation. The word of Yahweh is against Hadrach, it has come to rest on Damascus, for the
source of Aram belongs to Yahweh no less than all the tribes of Israel;



Zee 9:2 on Hamath too, which borders on it, and on (Tyre and) Sidon, despite her acumen.

Zee 9:3 Tyre has built herself a fortress, has heaped up silver like dust and gold like the dirt of the streets.

Zee 9:4 And now the Lord is going to dispossess her; at sea he will break her power, and she herself will go up
in flames.

Zee 9:5 Seeing this, Ashkelon will be terrified, Gaza too, and writhe with grief, Ekron too, at the ruin of her
prospects; the king will vanish from Gaza and Ashkelon be unpeopled,

Zee 9:6 while a half-breed will live in Ashdod! Yes, I shall destroy the pride of the Philistine;

Zee 9:7 I shall snatch his blood from his mouth, his abominations from between his teeth. But his remnant too
will belong to our God, becoming like a clan in Judah, and Ekron will become like a Jebusite.

Zee 9:8 I shall stand guard before my home to defend it against all comers, and no oppressor will overrun them
ever again, for now I am on the alert.

Zee 9:9 Rejoice heart and soul, daughter of Zion! Shout for joy, daughter of Jerusalem! Look, your king is
approaching, he is vindicated and victorious, humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.

Zee 9:10 He will banish chariots from Ephraim and horses from Jerusalem; the bow of war will be banished. He
will proclaim peace to the nations, his empire will stretch from sea to sea, from the River to the limits of the earth.
Zee 9:1 1 As for you, because of the blood of your covenant I have released your prisoners from the pit in which
there is no water.

Zee 9:12 Come back to the fortress, you prisoners waiting in hope. This very day, I vow, I shall make it up to you
twice over.

Zee 9:13 For I have strung Judah as a bow for myself, laid Ephraim on the string as an arrow, have roused your
sons, Zion, against your sons, Javan, and have made you like a warrior’s sword.

Zee 9:14 Then Yahweh will appear above them and his arrow will flash out like lightning. (The Lord) Yahweh will
sound the trumpet and advance in the storm-winds of the south.

Zee 9:15 Yahweh Sabaoth will protect them! They will devour, will trample on the sling-stones, they will drink
blood like wine, awash like bowls, like the corners of the altar.

Zee 9:16 Yahweh their God will give them victory when that day comes, like the sheep who are his people; yes,
the stones of a diadem will sparkle over his country.

Zee 9:17 How fine, how splendid that will be, with wheat to make the young men flourish, and new wine the
maidens!

Zee 10:1 Ask Yahweh for rain in autumn and at the time of the spring rains. Yahweh is the one to make the
storm-clouds. He will give them showers of rain; to each, grass in his field.

Zee 10:2 Since the domestic idols have talked nonsense, and the diviners have seen false signs, and dreams
have purveyed delusions, affording empty comfort, that is why they have strayed like sheep, in distress for want
of a shepherd.

Zee 10:3 My anger has been roused by the shepherds, and I shall vent it on the he-goats. When Yahweh
Sabaoth comes to visit his flock, the House of Judah, he will make it his royal war-horse.

Zee 10:4 From it will emerge Cornerstone and Tent-peg, from it, Bow-ready-for-Battle, from it, every type of
leader. Together

Zee 10:5 they will be like warriors trampling the dirt of the streets in battle; when they fight, because Yahweh is
with them, they will put mounted men to rout.

Zee 10:6 Then I shall make the House of Judah mighty and the House of Joseph victorious. I shall restore them,
because I have taken pity on them, and they will be as though I had never cast them off, for I am Yahweh their
God and shall answer their prayer.

Zee 10:7 Ephraim will be like a warrior. Their hearts will be cheered as though by wine. Their children will see
this and rejoice, their hearts will exult in Yahweh.

Zee 10:8 I shall whistle to them and gather them in, for I have redeemed them; they will be as numerous as they
used to be.

Zee 10:9 I shall scatter them among the peoples but in distant countries they will remember me, they will instruct
their children and then return.

Zee 10:10 I shall bring them home from Egypt and gather them back from Assyria; I shall lead them into Gilead
and the Lebanon, and even that will not be large enough for them.

Zee 10:1 1 They will cross the sea of Egypt (and the waves of the sea will be struck); all the depths of the River
will be dried up. The arrogance of Assyria will be cast down and the sceptre of Egypt taken away.

Zee 10:12 I shall make them mighty in Yahweh, and they will march in my name — Yahweh declares.

Zee 11:1 Open your gateways, Lebanon, and the fire shall burn down your cedar trees!

Zee 1 1 :2 Wail, juniper, for the cedar tree has fallen, the majestic ones have been ravaged! Wail, oaks of
Bashan, for the impenetrable forest has been felled!

Zee 1 1 :3 The sound of the wailing of shepherds! Their majesty has been ravaged. The sound of the roaring of
young lions! The pride of the Jordan has been ravaged.



Zee 1 1 :4 Yahweh my God says this, “Pasture the sheep for slaughter,

Zee 1 1 :5 whose buyers kill them and go unpunished, whose sellers say of them, ‘Blessed be Yahweh; now I am
rich!’. and whose own shepherds show them no pity.

Zee 1 1 :6 For I shall show no further pity for the inhabitants of the country — Yahweh declares! Instead, I shall
put everyone into the clutches of a neighbour, into the clutches of the king. They will crush the country and I shall
not rescue anyone from their clutches”.

Zee 1 1 :7 Then I pastured for slaughter the sheep belonging to the sheep-dealers. I took two staves: the one I
called “Goodwill”, the other “Couplers”; and I pastured the sheep myself,

Zee 1 1 :8 getting rid of three shepherds in one month. But I lost patience with them, and they equally detested
me.

Zee 11:91 then said, “I am not going to pasture you any more; the one doomed to die can die; the one doomed
to perish can perish; and the rest can devour one another”.

Zee 11:10 I then took my staff, “Goodwill”, and broke it in half, to break my covenant, which I had made with all
the peoples.

Zee 11:11 When it was broken, that day the sheep-dealers, who were watching me, realised that this had been
a word of Yahweh.

Zee 11:12 I then said to them, “If you see fit, give me my wages; if not, never mind”. So they weighed out my
wages: thirty shekels of silver.

Zee 11:13 Yahweh said to me, “Throw it to the smelter, this princely sum at which they have valued me!”. Taking
the thirty shekels of silver, I threw them into the Temple of Yahweh, for the smelter.

Zee 11:14 I then broke my second staff, “Couplers”, in half, to rupture the brotherly relationship between Judah
and Israel.

Zee 11:15 Next, Yahweh said to me, “This time, take the gear of a good-for-nothing shepherd.

Zee 11:16 For I am now going to raise a shepherd in this country, who will not bother about the lost, who will not
go in search of the stray, who will not heal the injured, who will not support the swollen, but who will eat the meat
of the fat ones, tearing off their very hoofs.

Zee 11:17 Disaster to the shepherd who deserts his flock! May the sword attack his arm and his right eye! May
his arm shrivel completely and his right eye be totally blinded!”.

Zee 12:1 A proclamation. The word of Yahweh about Israel (and also about Judah). Yahweh, who spread out
the heaven and founded the earth and formed the human spirit within, declares:

Zee 12:2 “Look, I shall make Jerusalem a cup to set all the surrounding peoples reeling. (That will be at the time
of the siege of Jerusalem.)

Zee 12:3 “When that day comes, I shall make Jerusalem a stone too heavy for all the peoples to lift; all those
who try to lift it will hurt themselves severely, although all the nations of the world will be massed against her.

Zee 12:4 When that day comes — declares Yahweh - I shall strike all the horses with panic and their riders with
madness. And I shall strike all the peoples with blindness. (But I shall keep watch over Judah.)

Zee 12:5 Then the rulers of Judah will say to themselves, ‘The strength of the inhabitants of Jerusalem lies in
Yahweh Sabaoth their God’.

Zee 12:6 When that day comes, I shall make the rulers of Judah like a brazier burning in a pile of wood, like a
torch flaming in a sheaf; and they will devour all the peoples round them to right and left. And Jerusalem will be
full of people as before, where she stands (in Jerusalem).

Zee 12:7 Yahweh will first save the tents of Judah, so that the glory of the House of David and the glory of the
inhabitants of Jerusalem do not increase at Judah’s expense.

Zee 12:8 When that day comes, Yahweh will protect the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and the frailest of them will be
like David when that day comes, and the House of David will be like God, like the angel of Yahweh, at their
head.

Zee 12:9 “When that day comes, I shall set about destroying all the nations who advance against Jerusalem.

Zee 12:10 But over the House of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem I shall pour out a spirit of grace and
prayer, and they will look to me. They will mourn for the one whom they have pierced as though for an only child,
and weep for him as people weep for a first-born child.

Zee 12:11 When that day comes, the mourning in Jerusalem will be as great as the mourning for Hadad
Rimmon in the Plain of Megiddo.

Zee 12:12 And the country will mourn clan by clan: The clan of the House of David by itself, and their women by
themselves; the clan of the House of Nathan by itself, and their women by themselves;

Zee 12:13 the clan of the House of Levi by itself, and their women by themselves; the clan of the House of
Shimei by itself, and their women by themselves;

Zee 12:14 all the rest of the clans, every clan by itself, and their women by themselves”.

Zee 13:1 “When that day comes, a fountain will be opened for the House of David and the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, to wash sin and impurity away.



Zee 13:2 “When that day comes — Yahweh declares — I shall cut off the names of the idols from the country, and
they will never be remembered again; I shall also rid the country of the prophets, and of the spirit of impurity.

Zee 13:3 Then, if anyone still goes on prophesying, his parents, his own father and mother will say to him, ‘You
shall not live, since you utter lies in Yahweh’s name’. And even while he is prophesying, his parents, his own
father and mother will pierce him through.

Zee 13:4 When that day comes, the prophets will all be ashamed to relate their visions when they prophesy and
no longer put on their hair cloaks with intent to deceive.

Zee 13:5 Instead, they will say, ‘I am no prophet. I am a man who tills the soil, for the land has been my living
since I was a boy’.

Zee 13:6 And if anyone asks him, ‘What are those gashes on your chest?’. he will reply, ‘I got them when I was
with my friends’”.

Zee 13:7 Awake, sword, against my shepherd, against the man who is close to me- declares Yahweh Sabaoth!
Strike the shepherd, scatter the sheep! And I shall turn my hand against the young!

Zee 13:8 So it will be, throughout the country- declares Yahweh Sabaoth- two-thirds in it will be cut off (be killed)
and the other third will be left.

Zee 13:9 I shall pass this third through the fire, refine them as silver is refined, test them as gold is tested. He
will call on my name and I shall answer him; I shall say, “He is my people”, and he will say, “Yahweh is my God!”.
Zee 14:1 Look, the Day of Yahweh is coming, when the spoils taken from you will be shared out among you.

Zee 14:2 For I shall gather all the nations to Jerusalem for battle. The city will be taken, the houses plundered,
the women ravished. Half the city will go into exile, but the rest of the people will not be ejected from the city.

Zee 14:3 Then Yahweh will sally out and fight those nations as once he fought on the day of battle.

Zee 14:4 When that day comes, his feet will rest on the Mount of Olives, which faces Jerusalem on the east,
and the Mount of Olives will be split in half from east to west, forming a huge valley; half the Mount will recede
northwards, the other half southwards.

Zee 14:5 The valley between the hills will be filled in, yes, it will be blocked as far as Jasol, it will be filled in as it
was by the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. And Yahweh my God will come, and all the holy
ones with him.

Zee 14:6 That Day, there will be no light, but only cold and frost.

Zee 14:7 And it will be one continuous day — Yahweh knows — there will be no more day and night, and it will
remain light right into the time of evening.

Zee 14:8 When that Day comes, living waters will issue from Jerusalem, half towards the eastern sea, half
towards the western sea; they will flow summer and winter.

Zee 14:9 Then Yahweh will become king of the whole world. When that Day comes, Yahweh will be the one and
only and his name the one name.

Zee 14:10 The entire country will be transformed into plain, from Geba to Rimmon in the Negeb, but Jerusalem
will stand high in her place and be full of people from the Benjamin Gate to the site of the earlier gate, to the
Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king’s wine-presses.

Zee 14:11 People will make their homes there. The curse of destruction will be lifted; Jerusalem will be safe to
live in.

Zee 14:12 And this is the plague with which Yahweh will strike all the nations who have fought against
Jerusalem; their flesh will rot while they are still standing on their feet; their eyes will rot in their sockets; their
tongues will rot in their mouths.

Zee 14:13 When that Day comes, a great terror will fall on them from Yahweh; each man will grab his
neighbour’s hand and they will fall to fighting among themselves.

Zee 14:14 Even Judah will fight against Jerusalem. The wealth of all the surrounding nations will be heaped
together: gold, silver, clothing, in vast quantity.

Zee 14:15 And the plague afflicting the horses, mules, camels, donkeys and all the other animals in those
armies will be the same.

Zee 14:16 After this, all the survivors of all the nations which have attacked Jerusalem will come up year after
year to worship the King, Yahweh Sabaoth, and to keep the feast of Shelters.

Zee 14:17 Should one of the races of the world fail to come up to Jerusalem to worship the King, Yahweh
Sabaoth, there will be no rain for that one.

Zee 14:18 Should the race of Egypt fail to come up and pay its visit, on it will fall the plague which Yahweh will
inflict on each of those nations which fail to come up to keep the feast of Shelters.

Zee 14:19 Such will be the punishment for Egypt and the punishment for all the nations which fail to come up to
keep the feast of Shelters.

Zee 14:20 When that Day comes, the very bells on the horses will be inscribed with the words, “Sacred to
Yahweh”, and the cooking pots of the house of Yahweh will be as holy as the sprinkling bowls before the altar.
Zee 14:21 Yes, every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be sacred to Yahweh Sabaoth, and all who



come to offer sacrifice will help themselves and do their cooking in them, and there will be no more traders in the
Temple of Yahweh Sabaoth, when that Day comes.

Mai 1:1 A message. The word of Yahweh to Israel through Malachi.

Mai 1 :2 “I have loved you, says Yahweh. But you ask, ‘How have you shown your love?’. Was not Esau Jacob’s
brother? declares Yahweh; even so, I loved Jacob

Mai 1 :3 but I hated Esau. I turned his mountains into a desert and his heritage into dwellings in the wastelands.
Mai 1 :4 If Edom says, ‘We have been struck down but we shall rebuild our ruins’, Yahweh Sabaoth says this,
‘Let them build, but I shall pull down! They will be known as Land of Wickedness and Nation-with-which-
Yahweh-is-angry-for-ever.

Mai 1:5 You will see this yourselves and you will say: Yahweh is mighty beyond the borders of Israel’.

Mai 1 :6 “The son honours his father, the slave stands in awe of his master. But if I am indeed father, where is
the honour due to me? And if I am indeed master, where is the awe due to me? says Yahweh Sabaoth to you
priests who despise my name. You ask, ‘How have we despised your name?’.

Mai 1:7 By putting polluted food on my altar. You ask, ‘How have we polluted you?’. By saying, ‘The table of
Yahweh deserves no respect’.

Mai 1 :8 When you bring blind animals for sacrifice, is this not wrong? When you bring the lame and the
diseased, is this not wrong? If you offer them to your governor, see if he is pleased with them or receives you
graciously, says Yahweh Sabaoth.

Mai 1 :9 In that case, try pleading with God to take pity on us (that is what you have done), and will he take any
notice? says Yahweh Sabaoth.

Mai 1:10 Why does one of you not close the doors and so stop the pointless lighting of fires on my altar? I am
not pleased with you, says Yahweh Sabaoth; from your hands I find no offerings acceptable.

Mai 1:11 But from farthest east to farthest west my name is great among the nations, and everywhere incense
and a pure gift are offered to my name, since my name is great among the nations, says Yahweh Sabaoth.

Mai 1:12 “But you have profaned it by saying, ‘The table of the Lord is polluted, hence the food offered on it
deserves no respect’.

Mai 1:13 You say, ‘How tiresome it all is!’. and sniff disdainfully at me, says Yahweh Sabaoth. You bring a
stolen, lame or diseased animal, you bring that as an offering! Am I to accept this from you? says Yahweh
Sabaoth.

Mai 1:14 Cursed be the rogue who has a male in his flock but pays his vow by sacrificing a blemished animal to
me! For I am a great king, says Yahweh Sabaoth, and among the nations my name inspires awe”.

Mai 2:1 “And now, priests, this commandment is for you.

Mai 2:2 If you will not listen, if you will not sincerely resolve to glorify my name, says Yahweh Sabaoth, I shall
certainly lay a curse on you and I shall curse your blessing. Indeed I will lay a curse, for none of you makes this
resolve.

Mai 2:3 Now, I am going to break your arm and throw offal in your faces — the offal of your solemn feasts — and
sweep you away with it.

Mai 2:4 Then you will know that I sent this commandment to you, to affirm my intention to maintain my covenant
with Levi, says Yahweh Sabaoth.

Mai 2:5 My covenant was with him — a covenant of life and peace, and these were what I gave him — a
covenant of respect, and he respected me and held my name in awe.

Mai 2:6 The law of truth was in his mouth and guilt was not found on his lips; he walked in peace and justice
with me and he converted many from sinning.

Mai 2:7 The priest’s lips ought to safeguard knowledge; his mouth is where the law should be sought, since he
is Yahweh Sabaoth’s messenger.

Mai 2:8 But you yourselves have turned aside from the way; you have caused many to lapse by your teaching.
Since you have destroyed the covenant of Levi, says Yahweh Sabaoth,

Mai 2:9 so I in my turn have made you contemptible and vile to the whole people, for not having kept my ways
and for being partial in applying the law.

Mai 2:10 “Is there not one Father of us all? Did not one God create us? Why, then, do we break faith with one
another, profaning the covenant of our ancestors?

Mai 2:11 Judah has broken faith; a detestable thing has been done in Israel and in Jerusalem. For Judah has
profaned Yahweh’s beloved sanctuary; he has married the daughter of an alien god.

Mai 2:12 May Yahweh deprive such an offender of witness and advocate in the tents of Jacob among those who
present offerings to Yahweh Sabaoth!

Mai 2:13 “And here is something else you do: you cover the altar of Yahweh with tears, with weeping and
wailing, because he now refuses to consider the offering or to accept it from you.

Mai 2:14 And you ask, ‘Why?’. Because Yahweh stands as witness between you and the wife of your youth,
with whom you have broken faith, even though she was your partner and your wife by covenant.



Mai 2:15 Did he not create a single being, having flesh and the breath of life? And what does this single being
seek? God — given offspring! Have respect for your own life then, and do not break faith with the wife of your
youth.

Mai 2:16 For I hate divorce, says Yahweh, God of Israel, and people concealing their cruelty under a cloak, says
Yahweh Sabaoth. Have respect for your own life then, and do not break faith.

Mai 2:17 “You have wearied Yahweh with your talk. You ask, ‘How have we wearied him?’. When you say, ‘Any
evil-doer is good as far as Yahweh is concerned; indeed he is delighted with them’; or when you say, ‘Where is
the God of fair judgement now?’.

Mai 3:1 “Look, I shall send my messenger to clear a way before me. And suddenly the Lord whom you seek will
come to his Temple; yes, the angel of the covenant, for whom you long, is on his way, says Yahweh Sabaoth.

Mai 3:2 Who will be able to resist the day of his coming? Who will remain standing when he appears? For he
will be like a refiner’s fire, like fullers’ alkali.

Mai 3:3 He will take his seat as refiner and purifier; he will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and
silver, so that they can make the offering to Yahweh with uprightness.

Mai 3:4 The offering of Judah and Jerusalem will then be acceptable to Yahweh as in former days, as in the
years of old.

Mai 3:5 I am coming to put you on trial and I shall be a ready witness against sorcerers, adulterers, perjurers,
and against those who oppress the wage-earner, the widow and the orphan, and who rob the foreigner of his
rights and do not respect me, says Yahweh Sabaoth.

Mai 3:6 “No; I, Yahweh, do not change; and you have not ceased to be children of Jacob!

Mai 3:7 Ever since the days of your ancestors, you have evaded my statutes and not observed them. Return to
me and 1 will return to you, says Yahweh Sabaoth. You ask, ‘How are we to return?

Mai 3:8 Can a human being cheat God?’. Yet you try to cheat me! You ask, ‘How do we try to cheat you?’. Over
tithes and contributions.

Mai 3:9 A curse lies on you because you, this whole nation, try to cheat me.

Mai 3:10 Bring the tithes in full to the treasury, so that there is food in my house; put me to the test now like this,
says Yahweh Sabaoth, and see if I do not open the floodgates of heaven for you and pour out an abundant
blessing for you.

Mai 3:11 For your sakes, I shall forbid the locust to destroy the produce of your soil or prevent the vine from
bearing fruit in your field, says Yahweh Sabaoth,

Mai 3:12 and all the nations will call you blessed, for you will be a land of delights, says Yahweh Sabaoth.

Mai 3:13 “You have said harsh things about me, says Yahweh. And yet you say, ‘What have we said against
you?’.

Mai 3:14 You have said, ‘It is useless to serve God; what is the good of keeping his commands or of walking
mournfully before Yahweh Sabaoth?

Mai 3:15 In fact, we now call the proud the happy ones; the evil-doers are the ones who prosper; they put God
to the test, yet come to no harm!’”.

Mai 3:16 Then those who feared Yahweh talked to one another about this, and Yahweh took note and listened;
and a book of remembrance was written in his presence recording those who feared him and kept his name in
mind.

Mai 3:17 “On the day when 1 act, says Yahweh Sabaoth, they will be my most prized possession, and 1 shall
spare them in the way a man spares the son who serves him.

Mai 3:18 Then once again you will see the difference between the upright person and the wicked one, between
the one who serves God and the one who does not serve him.

Mai 3:19 “For look, the Day is coming, glowing like a furnace. All the proud and all the evil-doers will be the
stubble, and the Day, when it comes, will set them ablaze, says Yahweh Sabaoth, leaving them neither root nor
branch.

Mai 3:20 But for you who fear my name, the Sun of justice will rise with healing in his rays, and you will come
out leaping like calves from the stall,

Mai 3:21 and trample on the wicked, who will be like ashes under the soles of your feet on the day when I act,
says Yahweh Sabaoth.

Mai 3:22 “Remember the Law of my servant Moses to whom at Horeb I prescribed decrees and rulings for all
Israel.

Mai 3:23 “Look, I shall send you the prophet Elijah before the great and awesome Day of Yahweh comes.

Mai 3:24 He will reconcile parents to their children and children to their parents, to forestall my putting the
country under the curse of destruction”.
