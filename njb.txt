

Ezr 1:1 In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia — to fulfil the word of Yahweh spoken through Jeremiah -Yahweh
roused the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia to issue a proclamation and to have it publicly displayed throughout his
kingdom:

Ezr 1 :2 “Cyrus king of Persia says this, ‘Yahweh, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth
and has appointed me to build him a Temple in Jerusalem, in Judah.

Ezr 1 :3 Whoëver among you belongs to the full tally of his people, may his God be with him! Let him go up to
Jerusalem, in Judah, and build the Temple of Yahweh, God of Israel, who is the God in Jerusalem.

Ezr 1 :4 And let each survivor, wherever he lives, be helped by the people of his locality with silver, gold,
equipment and riding beasts, as well as voluntary offerings for the Temple of God which is in Jerusalem’”.

Ezr 1 :5 Then the heads of families of Judah and of Benjamin, the priests and the Levites, in fact all whose spirit
had been roused by God, prepared to go and rebuild the Temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem;

Ezr 1 :6 and all their neighbours gave them every kind of help: silver, gold, equipment, riding beasts and



valuable presents, in addition to their voluntary offerings.

Ezr 1 :7 Furthermore, King Cyrus handed over the articles belonging to the Temple of Yahweh which
Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from Jerusalem and put in the temple of his god.

Ezr 1 :8 Cyrus king of Persia handed them over to Mithredath the treasurer who checked them out to
Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah.

Ezr 1 :9 The inventory was as follows: thirty gold dishes; one thousand silver dishes, twenty-nine repaired;

Ezr 1:10 thirty gold bowls; a thousand silver bowls, four hundred and ten damaged; one thousand other articles.
Ezr 1:11 In all, five thousand four hundred articles of gold and silver. Sheshbazzar took all these with him when
he led the exiles back from Babylon to Jerusalem.

Ezr 2:1 These were the people of the province who returned from the captivity of the Exile, those whom
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had deported to Babylon, and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to
his own town.

Ezr 2:2 They were the ones who arrived with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Nahamani,
Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum and Baanah. The number of the men of the people of the country of

Ezr 2:56 sons of Jaalah, sons of Darkon, sons of Giddel,

Ezr 2:57 sons of Shephatiah, sons of Hattil, sons of Pochereth-ha-Zebaim, sons of Ami.

Ezr 2:58 The total of the temple slaves and the sons of Solomon’s slaves: three hundred and ninety-two.

Ezr 2:59 The following, who came from Tel-Melah, Tel-Harsha, Cherub, Addan and Immer, could not prove that
their families and ancestry were of Israelite origin:

Ezr 2:60 the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda: six hundred and fifty-two.

Ezr 2:61 And among the sons of the priests: the sons of Habaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, the sons of Barzillai —
who had married one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, whose name he adopted.

Ezr 2:62 These had looked for their entries in the official genealogies but were not to be found there, and were
hence disqualified from the priesthood.

Ezr 2:63 Consequently, His Excellency forbade them to eat any of the consecrated food until a priest appeared
who could consult urim and thummim.

Ezr 2:64 The whole assembly numbered forty-two thousand, three hundred and sixty people,

Ezr 2:65 not counting their male and female slaves to the number of seven thousand three hundred and thirty-
seven. They also had two hundred male and female singers.

Ezr 2:66 Their horses numbered seven hundred and thirty-six, their mules two hundred and forty-five,

Ezr 2:67 their camels four hundred and thirty-five and their donkeys six thousand seven hundred and twenty.

Ezr 2:68 When they arrived at the Temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem, a certain number of heads of families made
voluntary offerings for the Temple of God, for its rebuilding on its site.

Ezr 2:69 In accordance with their means they gave sixty-one thousand gold drachmas, five thousand silver
minas and one hundred priestly robes to the sacred treasury.

Ezr 2:70 The priests, the Levites and some of the people settled in Jerusalem; the singers, the gatekeepers and
the temple slaves in their appropriate towns; and all the other Israelites in their own towns.

Ezr 3:1 When the seventh month came after the Israelites had been resettled in their towns, the people
gathered as one person in Jerusalem.

Ezr 3:2 Then Jeshua son of Jozadak, with his brother priests, and Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, with his brothers,
set about rebuilding the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings on it as prescribed in the Law of Moses
man of God.

Ezr 3:3 They erected the altar on its old site, despite their fear of the people of the country, and on it they
presented burnt offerings to Yahweh, burnt offerings morning and evening;

Ezr 3:4 they celebrated the feast of Shelters as prescribed, offering daily the number of burnt offerings required
from day to day,

Ezr 3:5 and in addition presented the continual burnt offerings prescribed for the Sabbaths, for the New Moons
and for all the festivals sacred to Yahweh, as well as those voluntary offerings made by individuals to Yahweh.
Ezr 3:6 From the first day of the seventh month they began presenting burnt offerings to Yahweh, though the
foundations of the Temple of Yahweh had not yet been laid.

Ezr 3:7 They also contributed money for the masons and carpenters, and food, drink and oil for the Sidonians
and Tyrians for bringing cedar wood from Lebanon by sea to Jaffa, for which Cyrus king of Persia had given
permission.

Ezr 3:8 It was in the second month of the second year after their arrival at the Temple of God in Jerusalem that
Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak, with the rest of their brothers, the priests, the Levites
and all the people who had returned to Jerusalem from captivity, began the work by appointing some of the
Levites who were twenty years old or more to superintend the work on the Temple of Yahweh.

Ezr 3:9 The Levites, Jeshua, his sons and his brothers, with Kadmiel, Binnui and his sons, the sons of
Hodaviah, agreed to superintend the men working on the Temple of God.

Ezr 3:10 When the builders had laid the foundations of the Temple of Yahweh, the priests in their robes stood
forward with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise Yahweh according to the
ordinances of David king of Israel.



Ezr 3:1 1 They chanted praise and thanksgiving to Yahweh because for Israel, they said, “he is good, and
everlasting in his faithful love”. Then all the people raised a mighty shout of praise to Yahweh, since the
foundations of the Temple of Yahweh had now been laid.

Ezr 3:12 Many of the older priests, Levites and heads of families, who had seen the first temple, wept very
loudly when the foundations of this one were laid before their eyes, but many others shouted aloud for joy,

Ezr 3:13 so that nobody could distinguish the noise of the joyful shout from the noise of the people’s weeping;
for the people shouted so loudly that the noise could be heard far away.

Ezr 4:1 When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the exiles were building the Temple of Yahweh,
God of Israel,

Ezr 4:2 they came to Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the heads of families and said, “Let us help you build, for we
resort to your God as you do and we have been sacrificing to him since the time of Esarhaddon king of Assyria,
who brought us here”.

Ezr 4:3 Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the other heads of Israelite families replied, “It is out of the question that you
should join us in building a Temple for our God. We shall build for Yahweh, God of Israel, on our own, as King
Cyrus king of Persia has commanded us”.

Ezr 4:4 The people of the country then set about demoralising the people of Judah and deterring them from
building;

Ezr 4:5 they also bribed counsellors against them to frustrate their purpose throughout the lifetime of Cyrus king
of Persia right on into the reign of Darius king of Persia.

Ezr 4:6 In the reign of Xerxes, at the beginning of his reign, they drew up an accusation against the inhabitants
of Judah and Jerusalem.

Ezr 4:7 In the days of Artaxerxes, Mithredath, Tabeel and their other associates wrote to Artaxerxes king of
Persia against Jerusalem; the text of the letter was written in Aramaic writing and dialect.

Ezr 4:8 Then Rehum the governor and Shimshai the secretary wrote a letter to King Artaxerxes, denouncing
Jerusalem as follows:

Ezr 4:9 “From Rehum the governor and Shimshai the secretary and their other associates, the judges, the
legates, the Persian officials, the people of Uruk, Babylon and Susa — that is, the Elamites-
Ezr 4:10 and the other peoples whom the great and illustrious Ashurbanipal deported and settled in the towns of
Samaria and in the rest of Transeuphrates”.

Ezr 4:1 1 This is the text of the letter which they sent him: “To King Artaxerxes, from your servants the people of
Transeuphrates:

Ezr 4:12 “May the king now please be informed that the Jews, who have come up from you to us, have arrived
in Jerusalem and are rebuilding the rebellious and evil city; they have begun rebuilding the walls and are laying
the foundations;

Ezr 4:13 and now the king should be informed that once this city is rebuilt and the walls are restored, they will
refuse to pay tribute, tax or toll, thus the king will incur a loss;

Ezr 4:14 and now, because we eat the palace salt, it is not proper for us to see this affront offered to the king;
we therefore send this information to the king

Ezr 4:15 so that a search may be made in the archives of your ancestors: in which archives you will find and
learn that this city is a rebellious city, the bane of kings and provinces, and that sedition has been stirred up
there from ancient times; that is why this city was destroyed.

Ezr 4:16 We inform the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are restored, you will soon have no territories
left in Transeuphrates”.

Ezr 4:17 The king sent this reply: “To Rehum the governor, to Shimshai the secretary, and to their other
associates resident in Samaria and elsewhere in Transeuphrates: Greetings!

Ezr 4:18 “And now, the document which you sent us has been accurately translated for me,

Ezr 4:19 and by my orders search has been made, and it has been found that this city has rebelled against the
kings in the past and that revolt and sedition have been contrived in it;

Ezr 4:20 and that powerful kings have reigned in Jerusalem, governing the whole of Transeuphrates and
exacting tribute, tax and toll;

Ezr 4:21 now give orders for these men to cease work; this city is not to be rebuilt until I give the order.

Ezr 4:22 Beware of acting negligently in this matter. Why should the harm grow, to endanger the king?”.

Ezr 4:23 As soon as the text of King Artaxerxes’ document had been read to Rehum the governor, Shimshai the
secretary and their associates, they hurried to the Jews in Jerusalem and stopped their work by force of arms.
Ezr 4:24 Work on the Temple of God in Jerusalem then ceased, and was discontinued until the second year of
the reign of Darius King of Persia.

Ezr 5:1 When the prophets Haggai and Zechariah son of Iddo prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and
Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel who was over them,

Ezr 5:2 Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak began rebuilding the Temple of God in



Jerusalem; with them were the prophets of God, supporting them.

Ezr 5:3 It was then that Tattenai governor of Transeuphrates, Shethar-Bozenai and their associates came to
them and asked, “Who gave you the order to rebuild this Temple and complete this structure?

Ezr 5:4 What are the names of the men putting up this building?”.

Ezr 5:5 But the eyes of their God were watching over the elders of the Jews, so they were not forced to stop
until a report could reach Darius and an official reply about the matter could be received from him.

Ezr 5:6 A copy of the letter which Tattenai, governor of Transeuphrates, Shethar-Bozenai and his associates,
the officials in Transeuphrates, sent to King Darius.

Ezr 5:7 They sent him a report which ran as follows: “To King Darius, hearty greetings!

Ezr 5:8 “The king should be informed that we went to the province of Judah, to the Temple of the great God,
which is being rebuilt with large stones; beams are being embedded in the walls; the work is being carried out
energetically and is making good progress.

Ezr 5:9 Questioning these elders, we asked them, ‘Who gave you permission to rebuild this Temple and
complete this structure?’.

Ezr 5:10 We also asked them their names, to inform you, so that we could record the names of the men who
were their leaders.

Ezr 5:1 1 “They gave us the following answer, ‘We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth; we are
rebuilding the Temple built many years ago, which a great king of Israel had built and completed.

Ezr 5:12 But because our ancestors angered the God of heaven, he handed them over to Nebuchadnezzar the
Chaldaean king of Babylon who destroyed this Temple and deported the people to Babylon.

Ezr 5:13 In the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, however, King Cyrus issued an official order that this Temple
of God should be rebuilt;

Ezr 5:14 furthermore, those gold and silver articles belonging to the Temple of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had
removed from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to the temple of Babylon, King Cyrus in turn removed from
the temple of Babylon and handed back to a certain Sheshbazzar whom he had appointed governor.

Ezr 5:15 He said to him, “Take these articles; go and return them to the Temple which is in Jerusalem and let
the Temple of God be rebuilt on its original site;”

Ezr 5:16 this Sheshbazzar then came and laid the foundations of the Temple of God in Jerusalem, and it has
been under construction ever since, and is not yet finished’.

Ezr 5:17 “Hence, if it please the king, let search be made in the royal treasuries in Babylon, to find out if it is true
that an official order was issued by King Cyrus for this temple of God in Jerusalem to be rebuilt; and let the king’s
decision on this matter be sent to us”.

Ezr 6:1 Then, on the order of King Darius, search was made in the archives deposited in the treasuries in
Babylon

Ezr 6:2 and a scroll was found in the fortress of Ecbatana, which ran as follows: “Memorandum.

Ezr 6:3 “In the first year of King Cyrus, King Cyrus issued this order: ‘Temple of God in Jerusalem. ‘The Temple
is to be rebuilt as a place of offering sacrifice and its foundations retained. Its height is to be sixty cubits, its width
sixty cubits,

Ezr 6:4 with three layers of large stones and one layer of timber. The cost is to be met by the royal treasury.

Ezr 6:5 Furthermore, the gold and silver articles belonging to the Temple of God which Nebuchadnezzar took
from the Temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon are to be given back and returned to the temple in
Jerusalem, each to its proper place, and deposited in the Temple of God’.

Ezr 6:6 “Hence, Tattenai governor of Transeuphrates, Shethar-Bozenai and your associates, the officials of
Transeuphrates, keep away from there!

Ezr 6:7 Leave the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews alone, to get on with their work on that
Temple of God; they are permitted to rebuild that Temple of God on that site.

Ezr 6:8 And herewith are my instructions as to how you will assist these elders of the Jews in the rebuilding of
that Temple of God: the cost is to be paid in full to these men from the royal revenue, that is, from the taxes of
Transeuphrates, and without interruption.

Ezr 6:9 And whatever is required — young bulls, rams, lambs for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, wheat,
salt, wine, oil, as the priests in Jerusalem request — is to be given them day by day without fail,

Ezr 6:10 so that they may offer sacrifices acceptable to the God of heaven and pray for the life of the king and
his sons.

Ezr 6:1 1 Furthermore I have issued an instruction that if anyone disobeys this order, a beam is to be torn from
his house, he is to be impaled on it and his house is to be reduced to a rubbish-heap for his offence;

Ezr 6:12 and may the God who has caused his name to live there overthrow the king of any people who dares
to defy this and destroy that Temple of God in Jerusalem! I, Darius, have issued this order. Let it be punctiliously
obeyed!”.

Ezr 6:13 Tattenai governor of Transeuphrates, Shethar-Bozenai and their associates punctiliously obeyed the



instructions sent by King Darius;

Ezr 6:14 and the elders of the Jews made good progress over their building, thanks to the prophetic activity of
the prophet Haggai and Zechariah son of Iddo, completing the reconstruction in accordance with the command
of the God of Israel and the order of Cyrus and of Darius.

Ezr 6:15 This Temple was completed on the twenty-third day of the month of Adar, in the sixth year of the reign
of King Darius.

Ezr 6:16 The Israelites — the priests, the Levites and the remainder of the exiles - joyfully celebrated the
dedication of this Temple of God;

Ezr 6:17 for the dedication of this Temple of God they offered one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four
hundred lambs and, as a sin offering for all Israel, twelve he-goats, corresponding to the number of the tribes of
Israel.

Ezr 6:18 Then they installed the priests in their orders and the Levites in their positions for the ministry of the
Temple of God in Jerusalem, as prescribed in the Book of Moses.

Ezr 6:19 The exiles celebrated the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.

Ezr 6:20 The Levites, as one man, had purified themselves; all were pure, so they sacrificed the Passover for all
the exiles, for their brothers the priests and for themselves.

Ezr 6:21 So the Israelites who had returned from exile and all those who had renounced the filthy practices of
the people of the country to join them in resorting to Yahweh, God of Israel, ate the Passover.

Ezr 6:22 For seven days they joyfully celebrated the feast of Unleavened Bread, for Yahweh had given them
cause to rejoice, having moved the heart of the king of Assyria in their favour to support them in their work on the
Temple of God, the God of Israel.

Ezr 7:1 After these events, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra son of Seraiah, son of Azariah, son of
Hilkiah,

Ezr 7:2 son of Shallum, son of Zadok, son of Ahitub,

Ezr 7:3 son of Amariah, son of Azariah, son of Meraioth,

Ezr 7:4 son ofZerahiah, son of Uzzi, son of Bukki,

Ezr 7:5 son of Abishua, son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of the chief priest Aaron-

Ezr 7:6 this Ezra came up from Babylon. He was a scribe versed in the Law of Moses, which Yahweh, God of

Israel, had given. The king gave him everything that he asked for, since the hand of Yahweh his God was over

him.

Ezr 7:7 A number of Israelites, priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers and temple slaves went up to Jerusalem in
the seventh year of the reign of King Artaxerxes.

Ezr 7:8 Ezra arrived in Jerusalem in the fifth month, in the seventh year of the king’s reign;

Ezr 7:9 for he had ordered the departure from Babylon on the first day of the first month, and he arrived in
Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month, since the kindly hand of his God was over him.

Ezr 7:10 For Ezra had devoted himself to studying the Law of Yahweh so as to put into practice and teach its
statutes and rulings.

Ezr 7:1 1 This is the text of the document which King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra, the priest-scribe, a student of
matters pertaining to Yahweh’s commandments and statutes relating to Israel:

Ezr 7:12 “Artaxerxes, king of kings, to the priest Ezra, Secretary of the Law of the God of heaven: greetings!

Ezr 7:13 “Now here are my orders. All members of the people of Israel in my kingdom, including their priests and
Levites, who freely choose to go to Jerusalem, may go with you,

Ezr 7:14 for you are being sent by the king and his seven counsellors to investigate how the Law of your God, in
which you are expert, is being applied in Judah and Jerusalem,

Ezr 7:15 and to transport the silver and gold which the king and his counsellors have voluntarily offered to the
God of Israel who resides in Jerusalem,

Ezr 7:16 as well as all the silver and gold which you receive throughout the province of Babylon and the
voluntary offerings freely contributed by the people and the priests for the Temple of their God in Jerusalem.

Ezr 7:17 “This money you will punctiliously use for the purchase of bulls, rams, lambs and the materials for the
oblations and libations which go with them, offering these on the altar of the Temple of your God in Jerusalem,
Ezr 7:18 and using the remainder of the silver and gold in accordance with the will of your God as you and your
brothers may think fit.

Ezr 7:19 “You will deliver the articles which have been given you for the ministry of the Temple of your God, to
the God of Jerusalem,

Ezr 7:20 and whatever else is needed and you are obliged to supply for the Temple of your God, you will supply
from the royal treasury.

Ezr 7:21 “I, King Artaxerxes, have issued the following instruction to all the treasurers of Transeuphrates:
Whatever the priest Ezra, Secretary of the Law of the God of heaven, may request of you is to be punctiliously
complied with:



Ezr 7:22 up to one hundred talants of silver, one hundred <i>kor</i> of wheat, one hundred bat of wine, one hundred
<i>bat</i> of oil, and unlimited salt.

Ezr 7:23 Whatever the God of heaven demands for the Temple of the God of heaven must be diligently
provided; why should retribution come on the realm of the king and of his sons?

Ezr 7 :24 You are further informed that it is against the law to impose tribute, tax or toll on any of the priests,
Levites, singers, gatekeepers, temple slaves or other servants of this temple of God.

Ezr 7:25 “And you, Ezra, by virtue of the wisdom of your God, which you possess, are to appoint magistrates
and scribes to administer justice for the whole people of Transeuphrates, that is, for all who know the Law of
your God; and you are to teach it to those who do not know it.

Ezr 7 :26 And on anyone who will not comply with the Law of your God and the Law of the king let sentence be
swiftly executed, whether it be death, banishment, fine or imprisonment”.

Ezr 7:27 Blessed be Yahweh, God of our ancestors, who moved the king’s heart in this way to restore the
beauty of the Temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem,

Ezr 7:28 won for me the faithful love of the king, his counsellors and all the most powerful of the king’s officials!
Taking heart since the hand of Yahweh my God was over me, I assembled those Israelite heads of families who
were to go with me.

Ezr 8:1 These, with their genealogies, were the heads of families who set out from Babylon with me in the reign
of King Artaxerxes:

Ezr 8:2 Of the sons of Phinehas: Gershom; of the sons of Ithamar: Daniel; of the sons of David: Hattush

Ezr 8:3 son of Shechaniah; of the sons of Parosh: Zechariah, and with him a hundred and fifty males officially

registered;

Ezr 8:4 of the sons of Pahath-Moab: Elioenai son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred males;

Ezr 8:5 of the sons of Zattu: Shechaniah son of Jahaziel, and with him three hundred males;

Ezr 8:6 of the sons of Adin: Ebed son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males;

Ezr 8:7 of the sons of Elam: Jeshaiah son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males;

Ezr 8:8 of the sons of Shephatiah: Zebadiah son of Michael, and with him eighty males;

Ezr 8:9 of the sons of Joab: Obadiah son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen males;

Ezr 8:10 of the sons of Bani: Shelomith son of Josiphiah, and with him a hundred and sixty males;

Ezr 8:11 of the sons of Bebai: Zechariah son of Bebai, and with him twenty-eight males;

Ezr 8:12 of the sons of Azgad: Johanan son of Hakkatan, and with him a hundred and ten males;

Ezr 8:13 of the sons of Adonikam: the younger sons, whose names are: Eliphelet, Jeiel and Shemaiah, and with
them sixty males;

Ezr 8:14 and of the sons of Bigvai: Uthai son of Zabud, and with him seventy males.

Ezr 8:15 I assembled them near the canal which runs to Ahava, where we camped for three days. I noticed
laymen and priests, but I could not discover any Levites there.

Ezr 8:16 I then sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah and Meshullam,
judicious men,

Ezr 8:17 and sent them to Iddo, the leading man of a place called Casiphia; I told them what they were to say to
Iddo and his kinsmen, living at the place called Casiphia, that is, to provide us with people to serve the Temple of
our God.

Ezr 8:18 And because the hand of God was good to us, they sent us a wise man of the sons of Mahli son of
Levi, son of Israel, a certain Sherebiah with his sons and kinsmen: eighteen men;

Ezr 8:19 also Hashabiah and with him his brother Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari with his kinsmen and sons:
twenty men;

Ezr 8:20 and two hundred and twenty temple slaves — descendants of the temple slaves whom David and the
princes had assigned to serve the Levites — all of them designated by name.

Ezr 8:21 There, beside the Ahava Canal, I then proclaimed a fast, to humble ourselves before our God and to
pray to him for a successful journey for us, our dependants and all our belongings.

Ezr 8:22 For I should have been ashamed to ask the king for a company of cavalry to protect us from hostile
people on our road, as we had already said to the king, “The hand of our God is over all who seek him for their
protection, but his mighty retribution befalls all those who forsake him”.

Ezr 8:23 So we fasted and pleaded with our God about this, and he heard us.

Ezr 8:24 I next chose twelve of the leading priests, and also Sherebiah and Hashabiah with ten of their kinsmen.
Ezr 8:25 To them I weighed out the silver, the gold and the utensils, the contributions which the king, his
counsellors, his notables and all the Israelites there present had made for the Temple of our God.

Ezr 8:26 To them I weighed out and handed over six hundred and fifty talants of silver, one hundred utensils of
silver valued at two talants, one hundred talants of gold,

Ezr 8:27 twenty golden bowls valued at a thousand darics and two utensils of fine burnished copper as precious
as gold.



Ezr 8:28 I said to them, “You are consecrated to Yahweh; these utensils are consecrated too; the silver and gold
are a voluntary offering to Yahweh, God of your ancestors.

Ezr 8:29 Guard them carefully until you weigh them out to the leading priests, the Levites, and the heads of
families of Israel in Jerusalem in the rooms of the Temple of Yahweh”.

Ezr 8:30 The priests and Levites then took charge of the silver, the gold and the utensils thus weighed, to bring
them to Jerusalem to the Temple of our God.

Ezr 8:31 On the twelfth day of the first month we left the Ahava Canal to make our way to Jerusalem; the hand
of our God was over us and protected us from enemies and surprise attacks on our way.

Ezr 8:32 When we arrived in Jerusalem, we rested for three days.

Ezr 8:33 On the fourth day the silver, the gold and the utensils were weighed in the Temple of our God and
handed over to the priest Meremoth son of Uriah and, with him, Eleazar son of Phinehas; with them were the
Levites Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui.

Ezr 8:34 By number and weight all was there. The total weight was recorded at the same time.

Ezr 8:35 When the exiles arrived from their captivity, they offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel — twelve
bulls on behalf of all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-two lambs, and as a sin offering twelve he-goats: the whole
of this as a burnt offering to Yahweh.

Ezr 8:36 They also delivered the king’s instructions to the king’s satraps and the governors of Transeuphrates,
who then supported the people and the Temple of God.

Ezr 9:1 Once this was done, the officials approached me to say, “The people of Israel, the priests and the
Levites, have not renounced the disgusting practices of the people of the country — the Canaanites, the Hittites,
the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Moabites, the Egyptians and the Amorites-

Ezr 9:2 since they and their sons have married some of their women, as a result of which the holy race has
been contaminated by the people of the country. The officials and leaders have been the worst offenders in this
act of infidelity”.

Ezr 9:3 On hearing this, I tore my clothes and my cloak; I pulled hair from my head and beard and sat down in
horror.

Ezr 9:4 All who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered round me, when faced with the infidelity of
the exiles, while I went on sitting there in horror until the evening sacrifice.

Ezr 9:5 At the evening sacrifice I came out of my stupor and, falling on my knees in my torn clothes and cloak,
stretched out my hands to Yahweh my God,

Ezr 9:6 and said: “My God, I am ashamed, I blush to lift my face to you, my God. For our iniquities have
increased, until they are higher than our heads, and our guilt has risen as high as heaven.

Ezr 9:7 From the days of our ancestors until now we have been deeply guilty and, because of our iniquities, we,
our kings and our priests, have been handed over to the kings of other countries, to the sword, to captivity, to
pillage, to shame, as is the case today.

Ezr 9:8 And now, for a brief moment, the favour of Yahweh our God has allowed a remnant of us to escape and
given us a stable home in his holy place, so that our God can raise our spirits and revive us a little in our slavery.
Ezr 9:9 For we are slaves; but God has not forgotten us in our slavery; he has extended his faithful love to us
even under the kings of Persia and revived us to rebuild the Temple of our God, restore its ruins and provide us
with a refuge in Judah and in Jerusalem.

Ezr 9:10 But now, our God, what can we say after this? For we have abandoned your commandments,

Ezr 9:1 1 which you gave through your servants the prophets in these terms, ‘The country which you are about
to possess is a polluted country, polluted by the people of the country and their disgusting practices, which have
filled it with their filth from end to end.

Ezr 9:12 Hence you are not to give your daughters in marriage to their sons, or let their daughters marry your
sons, or ever concern yourselves about peace or good relations with them, if you want to grow stronger, to live
off the fat of the land and bequeath it to your sons for ever’.

Ezr 9:13 “After all that has befallen us because of our evil deeds and our deep guilt — though you, our God, have
punished us less than our iniquities deserved and have allowed us to escape like this-
Ezr 9:14 are we to break your commandments again and intermarry with people with these disgusting
practices? Would you not be enraged with us to the point of destroying us, leaving neither remnant nor survivor?
Ezr 9:15 Yahweh, God of Israel, you are upright. We survive only as the remnant we are today. We come before
you in our guilt; because of it we cannot stand in your presence”.

Ezr 10:1 While Ezra, weeping and prostrating himself in front of the Temple of God, was praying and making
confession, a very large crowd of men, women and children of Israel gathered round him, the people weeping
bitterly.

Ezr 1 0:2 Then Shechaniah son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, spoke up and said to Ezra, “We have been
unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women from the people of the country. But, in spite of this, there is still
some hope for Israel.



Ezr 10:3 We will make a covenant with our God to send away all the foreign wives and their children in
obedience to the advice of my lord and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God. Let us act in
accordance with the Law.

Ezr 10:4 Go ahead, do your duty; we support you. Be brave, take action!”.

Ezr 10:5 Then Ezra stood up and put the leading priests and Levites and all Israel on oath to do what had been
said. They took the oath.

Ezr 10:6 Ezra then left his place in front of the Temple of God and went to the room of Jehohanan son of
Eliashib, where he spent the night without eating food or drinking water, because he was still mourning over the
exiles’ infidelity.

Ezr 10:7 A proclamation was issued throughout Judah and Jerusalem that all the exiles were to assemble in
Jerusalem,

Ezr 1 0:8 and that anyone who failed within three days to answer the summons of the officials and elders was to
forfeit all his possessions and himself be excluded from the community of the exiles.

Ezr 10:9 As a result, all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled in Jerusalem within the three days; it was
the twentieth day of the ninth month. All the people sat down in the square in front of the Temple of God,
trembling because of the matter in hand and because of the heavy rain.

Ezr 10:10 The priest Ezra then stood up and said to them, “You have been unfaithful and have married foreign
wives, thus adding to Israel’s guilt.

Ezr 10:1 1 So now give thanks to Yahweh, God of your ancestors, and do his will by holding aloof from the
people of the country and from foreign wives”.

Ezr 10:12 In ringing tones, the whole assembly answered, “Yes, our duty is to do as you say.

Ezr 10:13 But there are many people here and it is the rainy season; we cannot stay out in the open; besides,
this is not something that can be dealt with in one or two days, since many of us have been unfaithful over this.
Ezr 10:14 Let our officials deputise for the whole community, and all the people in our towns who have married
foreign wives can come at stated times, accompanied by elders and judges from each town, until our God’s
fierce anger over this is turned away from us”.

Ezr 10:15 Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah, supported by Meshullam and Shabbethai
the Levite, were opposed to this.

Ezr 10:16 The exiles did as had been proposed. And the priest Ezra selected the family heads of the various
families, all of them by name, who began their sittings on the first day of the tenth month to look into the matter.
Ezr 10:17 And by the first day of the first month they had dealt with all the men who had married foreign women.
Ezr 10:18 Among the priests who were found to have married foreign wives were: of the sons of Jeshua son of
Jozadak and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib and Gedaliah,

Ezr 10:19 who agreed to send their wives away; their guilt offering was a ram from the flock for their guilt;

Ezr 10:20 of the sons of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah;

Ezr 1 0:21 of the sons of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel and Uzziah;

Ezr 1 0:22 of the sons of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad and Elasah;

Ezr 10:23 of the Levites: Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah — that is, Kelita-Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer;

Ezr 10:24 of the singers: Eliashib and Zaccur; of the gatekeepers: Shallum, Telem and Uri;

Ezr 10:25 and of the Israelites: of the sons of Parosh: Ramiah, Izziah, Malchijah, Mijamin, Eleazar, Malchijah
and Benaiah;

Ezr 1 0:26 of the sons of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth and Elijah;

Ezr 10:27 of the sons of Zattu: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad and Aziza;

Ezr 1 0:28 of the sons of Bebai: Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, Atlai;

Ezr 1 0:29 of the sons of Bigvai: Meshullam, Malluch, Jedaiah, Jashub, Sheal, Jeremoth;

Ezr 1 0:30 of the sons of Pahath-Moab: Adna, Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui and
Manasseh;

Ezr 1 0:31 of the sons of Harim: Eliezer, Isshijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,

Ezr 10:32 Benjamin, Malluch, Shemariah;

Ezr 1 0:33 of the sons of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, Shimei;

Ezr 1 0:34 of the sons of Bani: Maadai, Amram, Uel,

Ezr 10:35 Benaiah, Bediah, Jeluhi,

Ezr 10:36 Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,

Ezr 10:37 Mattaniah, Mattenai and Jaasau;

Ezr 1 0:38 of the sons of Binnui: Shimei,

Ezr 10:39 Shelemiah, Nathan and Adaiah;

Ezr 10:40 of the sons of Zaccai: Shashai, Sharai,

Ezr 10:41 Azarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah,

Ezr 10:42 Shallum, Amariah, Joseph;



Ezr 10:43 of the sons of Nebo: Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, Joel, Benaiah.

Ezr 10:44 All these had married foreign wives but sent them away with their children.

Neh 1:1 The words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah. It happened in the month of Chislev, in the twentieth year,
while I was in the citadel of Susa,

Neh 1 :2 that Hanani, one of my brothers, arrived with some men from Judah. I asked them about the Jews —
those who had escaped and those who survived from the captivity — and about Jerusalem.

Neh 1:3 They replied, The survivors remaining there in the province since the captivity are in a very bad and
demoralised condition: the walls of Jerusalem are in ruins and its gates have been burnt down”.

Neh 1 :4 On hearing this I sat down and wept; for some days I mourned, fasting and praying before the God of
heaven.

Neh 1:5 I said, “Yahweh, God of heaven — the great and awe-inspiring God who keeps a covenant of faithful
love with those who love him and obey his commandments-

Neh 1 :6 let your ear be attentive and your eyes open, to listen to your servant’s prayer, which I now offer to you
day and night on behalf of your servants the Israelites. I admit the sins of the Israelites, which we have
committed against you. Both I and my father’s House have sinned;

Neh 1:7 we have acted very wickedly towards you by not keeping the commandments, laws and rulings which
you enjoined on your servant Moses.

Neh 1 :8 Remember, I beg you, the promise which you solemnly made to your servant Moses, ‘If you are
unfaithful, I shall scatter you among the peoples;

Neh 1 :9 but if you come back to me and keep my commandments and practise them, even though those who
have been banished are at the very sky’s end, I shall gather them from there and bring them back to the place
which I have chosen as a dwelling-place for my name’.

Neh 1:10 Since they are your servants, your people, whom you have redeemed with your mighty power and
strong hand,

Neh 1:11 O Lord, let your ear now be attentive to your servant’s prayer and to the prayer of your servants who
want to revere your name. I beg you let your servant be successful today and win this man’s compassion”. At the
time I was cupbearer to the king.

Neh 2:1 In the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, since I was in charge of the wine, I took
the wine and offered it to the king. Now, he had never seen me looking depressed before.

Neh 2:2 So the king said to me, “Why are you looking depressed? You are not sick! This must be a sadness of
the heart”. Thoroughly alarmed by this,

Neh 2:3 I said to the king, “May the king live for ever! How can I not look depressed when the city where the
tombs of my ancestors are lies in ruins and its gates have been burnt down?”.

Neh 2:4 The king then said to me, “What would you like me to do?”. Praying to the God of heaven,

Neh 2:5 I said to the king, “If the king approves and your servant enjoys your favour, send me to Judah, to the
city of the tombs of my ancestors, so that I can rebuild it”.

Neh 2:6 The king — with the queen sitting beside him-said, “How long will your journey take, and when will you
come back?”. Once I had given him a definite time, the king approved my mission.

Neh 2:7 I then said to the king, “If the king approves, may I be given orders for the governors of Transeuphrates
to let me pass through on my way to Judah?

Neh 2:8 Also an order for Asaph, keeper of the king’s forest, to supply me with timber for the beams of the gates
of the citadel of the Temple, for the city walls and for the house which I am to occupy?”. These the king granted
me because the kindly hand of my God was over me.

Neh 2:9 When I reached the governors of Transeuphrates, I gave them the king’s orders. The king had sent an
escort of army officers and cavalry along with me.

Neh 2:10 When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the official of Ammon heard about this, they were
exceedingly displeased that someöne had come to promote the welfare of the Israelites.

Neh 2:1 1 And so I reached Jerusalem. After I had been there three days,

Neh 2:12 I got up during the night with a few other men — 1 had not told anyone what my God had inspired me to
do for Jerusalem — taking no animal with me other than my own mount.

Neh 2:13 Under cover of dark I went out through the Valley Gate towards the Dragon’s Fountain as far as the
Dung Gate, and examined the wall of Jerusalem where it was broken down and its gates burnt out.

Neh 2:14 I then crossed to the Fountain Gate and the King’s Pool, but it was impassable to my mount.

Neh 2:15 So I went up the Valley in the dark, examining the wall; I then went in again through the Valley Gate,
coming back

Neh 2:16 without the officials knowing where I had gone or what I had been doing. So far I had said nothing to
the Jews: neither to the priests, the nobles, the officials nor any other persons involved in the undertaking.

Neh 2:17 I then said to them, “You see what a sorry state we are in: Jerusalem is in ruins and its gates have
been burnt down. Come on, we must rebuild the walls of Jerusalem and put an end to our humiliating position!”.



Neh 2:18 And I told them how the kindly hand of my God had been over me, and the words which the king had
said to me. At this they said, “Let us start building at once!”. and they set their hands to the good work.

Neh 2:19 When Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the official of Ammon, and Geshem the Arab heard about this,
they laughed at us and jeered. They said, “What is this you are doing? Are you going to revolt against the king?”.
Neh 2:20 But I gave them this answer, “The God of heaven will grant us success and we, his servants, mean to
start building; as for you, you have neither share nor right nor memorial in Jerusalem”.

Neh 3:1 Eliashib the high priest with his brother priests then set to work and rebuilt the Sheep Gate; they made
the framework, hung its doors, fixed its bolts and bars and proceeded as far as the Tower of the Hundred and
the Tower of Hananel.

Neh 3:2 The men of Jericho built next to him; Zaccur son of Imri built next to them.

Neh 3:3 The sons of Ha-Senaah rebuilt the Fish Gate; they made the framework, hung its doors and fixed its
bolts and bars.

Neh 3:4 Meremoth son of Uriah, son of Hakkoz, carried out repairs next to them; Meshullam son of Berechiah,
son of Meshezabel, carried out repairs next to him; and Zadok son of Baana carried out repairs next to him.

Neh 3:5 The men of Tekoa carried out repairs next to him, though their nobles would not demean themselves to
help their masters.

Neh 3:6 Joiada son of Paseah and Meshullam son of Besodeiah repaired the gate of the New Quarter; they
made the framework, hung its doors and fixed its bolts and bars.

Neh 3:7 Next to them repairs were carried out by Melatiah of Gibeon, Jadon of Meronoth, and the men of
Gibeon and Mizpah, for the sake of the governor of Transeuphrates.

Neh 3:8 Next to them repairs were carried out by Uzziel son of Harhaiah, a member of the metal-workers’ guild,
and next to him repairs were carried out by Hananiah of the perfumers’ guild. These renovated the wall of
Jerusalem as far as the Broad Wall.

Neh 3:9 Next to them repairs were carried out by Rephaiah son of Hur, who was head of one half of the district
of Jerusalem.

Neh 3:10 Next to them Jedaiah son of Harumaph carried out repairs opposite his own house; next to him repairs
were carried out by Hattush son of Hashabneiah.

Neh 3:1 1 Malchijah son of Harim and Hasshub son of Pahath-Moab repaired another section as far as the
Furnace Tower.

Neh 3:12 Next to them repairs were carried out by Shallum son of Hallohesh, head of the other half of the
district of Jerusalem, by him and his sons.

Neh 3:13 Hanun and the inhabitants of Zanoah repaired the Valley Gate: they rebuilt it, hung its doors and fixed
its bolts and bars; they also repaired a thousand cubits of wall up to the Dung Gate.

Neh 3:14 Malchijah son of Rechab, head of the district of Beth-ha-Cherem, repaired the Dung Gate; he rebuilt it,
hung its doors and fixed its bolts and bars.

Neh 3:15 Shallum son of Col-Hozeh, head of the district of Mizpah, repaired the Fountain Gate; he rebuilt it,
roofed it, hung its doors and fixed its bolts and bars. He also rebuilt the wall of the Pool of Siloah, adjoining the
king’s garden, as far as the steps going down from the City of David.

Neh 3:16 After him, Nehemiah son of Azbuk, head of half the district of Beth-Zur, carried out repairs from a point
opposite the Davidic Tombs to the artificial pool and the House of the Champions.

Neh 3:17 After him, repairs were carried out by the Levites: Rehum son of Bani; and next to him Hashabiah,
head of one half of the district of Keilah, carried out repairs for his own district.

Neh 3:18 After him, repairs were carried out by their brothers: Binnui son of Henadad, head of the other half of
the district of Keilah.

Neh 3:19 Next to him, Ezer son of Jeshua, headman of Mizpah, repaired another section in front of the ascent
to the armoury at the Angle.

Neh 3:20 After him, Baruch son of Zabbai repaired another section from the Angle to the door of the house of
Eliashib the high priest.

Neh 3:21 After him, Meremoth son of Uriah, son of Hakkoz, repaired another section from the door of Eliashib’s
house as far as the end of Eliashib’s house.

Neh 3:22 And after him repairs were carried out by the priests who lived in the district.

Neh 3:23 After them repairs were carried out by Benjamin and Hasshub, opposite their own house. After them
repairs were carried out by Azariah son of Maaseiah, son of Ananiah, beside his own house.

Neh 3:24 After him, Binnui son of Henadad repaired another section from Azariah’s house as far as the Angle at
the corner.

Neh 3:25 After him, Palal son of Uzai carried out repairs in front of the Angle and the tower projecting from the
king’s Upper Palace by the Court of the Guard; and after him, Pedaiah son of Parosh carried out the repairs
Neh 3:26 to a point by the Water Gate to the east and the projecting tower.

Neh 3:27 After him, the men of Tekoa repaired another section from in front of the great projecting tower as far



as the wall of Ophel.

Neh 3:28 From the Horse Gate onwards repairs were carried out by the priests, each in front of his own house.
Neh 3:29 After them repairs were carried out by Zadok son of Immer in front of his house, and after him repairs
were carried out by Shemaiah son of Shechaniah, keeper of the East Gate.

Neh 3:30 After him Hananiah son of Shelemiah and Hanun sixth son of Zalaph repaired another section, after
whom repairs were carried out by Meshullam son of Berechiah in front of his room.

Neh 3:31 After him Malchijah, of the metal-workers’ guild, repaired as far as the Hall of the temple slaves and
merchants, in front of the Muster Gate, as far as the upper room at the corner.

Neh 3:32 And between the upper room at the corner and the Sheep Gate repairs were carried out by the
goldsmiths and the merchants.

Neh 3:33 When Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became furiously angry.

Neh 3:34 He ridiculed the Jews and in front of his kinsmen and the aristocracy of Samaria he exclaimed, “What
are these pathetic Jews doing … ? Are they going to give up? Or offer sacrifices? Or complete the work in a
day? Can they put new life into stones taken from rubbish heaps and even charred?”.

Neh 3:35 And beside him Tobiah of Ammon remarked, “If a jackal were to jump on what they are building, it

would knock their stone wall down!”.

Neh 3:36 Listen, our God, for we are despised! Make their sneers fall back on their own heads! Send them as
booty to a land of captivity!

Neh 3:37 Do not pardon their wickedness, may their sin never be erased before you, for they have insulted the
builders to their face!

Neh 3:38 Meanwhile we were rebuilding the wall, which was soon joined up all the way round to mid-height; the
people put their hearts into the work.

Neh 4:1 When Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites and the Ashdodites heard that repairs to the walls
of Jerusalem were going forward — that the gaps were beginning to fill up — they became very angry,

Neh 4:2 and they all plotted to come and attack Jerusalem and upset my plans.

Neh 4:3 We, however, prayed to our God and organised a guard day and night to protect the city from them.

Neh 4:4 But in Judah the saying went, “The strength of the carrier falters, the rubbish heap is so vast that by
ourselves we cannot rebuild the wall!”.

Neh 4:5 And our opponents said, “They will never know or see a thing, until we are in there among them, and
then we shall massacre them and put a stop to the work”.

Neh 4:6 Now when the Jews who lived near them had warned us ten times over, “They are coming up against
us from every place they live in”,

Neh 4:7 men took up position in the space behind the wall at those points where it was lowest, and I organised
the people by families with their swords, spears and bows.

Neh 4:8 Aware of their anxiety, I then addressed the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, “Do not be
afraid of them. Remember the great and awe-inspiring Lord and fight for your kinsmen, your sons, your
daughters, your wives and your homes”.

Neh 4:9 Once our enemies heard that we were forewarned and that God had thwarted their plan, they withdrew
and we all went back to the wall, each one to his work.

Neh 4:10 From then on, half my own retainers went on working, while the other half stood by, armed with
spears, shields, bows and armour to protect the whole House of Judah as they rebuilt the wall.

Neh 4:1 1 The carriers were armed, working with one hand and holding a spear in the other.

Neh 4:12 Each builder had his sword strapped to his side as he built. Beside me stood a trumpeter.

Neh 4:13 I then said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, “The work is great and widely spread
out, and we are deployed along the wall some way from one another.

Neh 4:14 Rally to us wherever you hear the trumpet sounding; our God will fight for us”.

Neh 4:15 And so we went on with the work from break of day until the stars came out.

Neh 4:16 At the same time I also told the people, “Let every man, with his attendant, spend the night inside
Jerusalem; we shall spend the night on guard and the day at work”.

Neh 4:17 Neither I, nor my brothers, nor my attendants, nor my bodyguards, ever took off our clothes; each one
kept his spear in his right hand.

Neh 5:1 There was a great outcry from the people, and from their wives, against their brother Jews.

Neh 5:2 Some said, “We are having to pledge our sons and daughters to get enough grain to eat and keep us
alive”.

Neh 5:3 Others said, “We are having to mortgage our fields, our vineyards and our houses to get grain because
of the shortage”.

Neh 5:4 Still others said, “We have had to borrow money on our fields and our vineyards to pay the royal tax;
Neh 5:5 and though we belong to the same race as our brothers, and our children are as good as theirs, we
shall have to sell our sons and our daughters into slavery; some of our daughters have been sold into slavery



already. We can do nothing about it, since our fields and our vineyards now belong to others”.

Neh 5:6 When I heard their complaints and these words I was very angry.

Neh 5:7 Having turned the matter over in my mind, I reprimanded the nobles and the officials as follows, “Each
of you is imposing a burden on his brother”. Summoning a great assembly to deal with them,

Neh 5:8 I said to them, “To the best of our power, we have redeemed our brother Jews who were forced to sell
themselves to foreigners, and now you in turn are selling your brothers, for them to be bought back by us!”. They
were silent and could find nothing to say.

Neh 5:9 “What you are doing”, I went on, “is wrong. Do you not want to walk in the fear of our God and escape
the sneers of the nations, our enemies?

Neh 5:10 I too, with my brothers and retainers, have lent them money and grain. Let us cancel these pledges.
Neh 5:1 1 This very day return them their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves and their houses, and cancel
the claim on the money, grain, new wine and olive oil, which you have lent them”.

Neh 5:12 “We shall make restitution”, they replied, “we shall claim nothing more from them; we shall do as you
say”. Summoning the priests, I then made them swear to do as they had promised.

Neh 5:13 Then, shaking out the fold of my garment, I said, “May God thus shake out of house and possessions
anyone who does not make good this promise; may he be shaken out thus and left empty!”. And the whole
assembly answered, “Amen” and praised Yahweh. And the people kept this promise.

Neh 5:14 What is more, from the time when the king appointed me to be their governor in Judah, from the
twentieth to the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, for twelve years, neither I nor my brothers ever levied the
governor’s subsistence allowance,

Neh 5:15 whereäs the former governors, my predecessors, had been a burden on the people, from whom they
took forty silver shekels a day for food and wine, while their attendants oppressed the people too. But I, fearing
God, never did this.

Neh 5:16 Also, not acquiring any land, I concentrated on the work of this wall and all my attendants joined in the
work together, too.

Neh 5:17 Furthermore, magistrates and officials to the number of a hundred and fifty ate at my table, not to
mention those who came to us from the surrounding nations.

Neh 5:18 Every day, one ox, six fine sheep, as well as poultry, were prepared for me; every ten days, skins of
wine were brought in bulk. But even so, I never claimed the governor’s subsistence allowance, since the people
already had burden enough to bear.

Neh 5:19 To my credit, my God, remember all I have done for this people.

Neh 6:1 When Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab and our other enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall and
that not a single gap was left — though at that time I had not fixed the doors to the gates-

Neh 6:2 Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message, “Come and meet us at Ha-Chephirim in the Vale of Ono”.
But they had evil designs on me.

Neh 6:3 So I sent messengers to them to say, “I am engaged in a great undertaking, so I cannot come down.
Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?”.

Neh 6:4 Four times they sent me the same invitation and I made them the same reply.

Neh 6:5 The fifth time, with the same purpose in mind, Sanballat sent me his servant bearing an open letter.

Neh 6:6 It ran, “There is a rumour among the nations — and Gashmu confirms it — that you and the Jews are
thinking of rebelling, which is why you are rebuilding the wall, and you intend to become their king;

Neh 6:7 and that you have even briefed prophets to acclaim you in Jerusalem with the cry, ‘There is a king in
Judah!’. Now, these rumours are going to reach the king; so you had better come and discuss them with us”.

Neh 6:8 To this I sent him the following reply, “As regards what you say, nothing of the sort has occurred; it is a
figment of your own imagination”.

Neh 6:9 For they were all trying to terrorise us, thinking, “They will become demoralised over the work and it will
not get finished”. But my morale rose even higher.

Neh 6:10 Then, when I went to visit Shemaiah son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, since he was prevented from
coming to me, he said: We must gather at the Temple of God, inside the sanctuary itself; we must shut the
sanctuary doors, for they are coming to kill you, they are coming to kill you tonight!

Neh 6:1 1 But I retorted, “Should a man like me run away? Would a man like me go into the Temple to save his
life? I shall not go in!”.

Neh 6:12 I realised that God had not sent him to say this, but that he had produced this prophecy for me
because Tobiah was paying him

Neh 6:13 to terrorise me into doing as he said and committing a sin, so that they would have grounds for
blackening my reputation and blaming me.

Neh 6:14 Remember Tobiah, my God, for what he did; and Noadiah the prophetess, and the other prophets
who tried to terrorise me.

Neh 6:15 The wall was finished within fifty-two days, on the twenty-fifth of Elul.



Neh 6:16 When all our enemies heard about it and all the surrounding nations saw it, they thought it a wonderful
thing, because they realised that this work had been accomplished by the power of our God.

Neh 6:17 During this same period, the nobles of Judah kept sending letter after letter to Tobiah, and letters from
Tobiah kept arriving for them;

Neh 6:18 for he had many sworn to his interest in Judah, since he was son-in-law to Shecaniah son of Arah,
and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah.

Neh 6:19 They even cried up his good deeds in my presence, and they reported what I said back to him. And
Tobiah kept sending letters to terrorise me.

Neh 7:1 Now, when the wall had been rebuilt and I had hung the doors, the gatekeepers (the singers and the
Levites) were then appointed.

Neh 7:2 I entrusted the administration of Jerusalem to my brother Hanani, and to Hananiah the commander of
the citadel, for he was a more trustworthy, God-fearing man than many others.

Neh 7:3 I said to them, “The gates of Jerusalem must not be opened until the sun gets hot; and the doors must
be shut and barred before it begins to go down. Detail guards from the residents of Jerusalem, each to his post,
in front of his own house”.

Neh 7:4 The city was large and spacious but the population was small, and the houses had not been rebuilt.

Neh 7:5 My God then inspired me to assemble the nobles, the officials and the people for the purpose of taking
a census by families. I discovered the genealogical register of those who had returned in the first group, and
there I found entered:

Neh 7:6 These are the people of the province who returned from the captivity of the Exile, those whom
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had deported, and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own
town.

Neh 7:7 They were the ones who arrived with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani,
Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:

Neh 7:8 sons of Parosh, two thousand one hundred and seventy-two;

Neh 7:9 sons of Shephatiah, three hundred and seventy-two;

Neh 7:10 sons of Arah, six hundred and fifty-two;

Neh 7:25 sons of Gibeon, ninety-five;

Neh 7:26 men of Bethlehem and Netophah, one hundred and eighty-eight;

Neh 7:27 men of Anathoth, one hundred and twenty-eight;

Neh 7:28 men of Beth-Azmaveth, forty-two;

Neh 7:29 men of Kiriath-Jearim, Chephirah and Beeroth, seven hundred and forty-three;

Neh 7:30 men of Ramah and Geba, six hundred and twenty-one;

Neh 7:31 men of Michmas, one hundred and twenty-two;

Neh 7:32 men of Bethel and Ai, one hundred and twenty-three;

Neh 7:33 men of the other Nebo, fifty-two;

Neh 7:34 sons of the other Elam, one thousand two hundred and fifty-four;

Neh 7:35 sons of Harim, three hundred and twenty;

Neh 7:36 sons of Jericho, three hundred and forty-five;

Neh 7:37 sons of Lod, Hadid and Ono, seven hundred and twenty-one;

Neh 7:38 sons of Senaah, three thousand nine hundred and thirty.

Neh 7:39 The priests: sons of Jedaiah, of the House of Jeshua, nine hundred and seventy-three;

Neh 7:40 sons of Immer, one thousand and fifty-two;

Neh 7:41 sons of Pashhur, one thousand two hundred and forty-seven;



Neh 7:42 sons of Harim, one thousand and seventeen.

Neh 7:43 The Levites: sons of Jeshua, of Kadmiel, of the sons of Hodiah, seventy-four.

Neh 7:44 The singers: sons of Asaph, one hundred and forty-eight.

Neh 7:45 The gatekeepers: sons of Shallum, sons of Ater, sons of Talmon, sons of Akkub, sons of Hatita, sons
of Shobai, one hundred and thirty-eight.

Neh 7:46 The temple slaves: sons of Ziha, sons of Hasupha, sons of Tabbaoth,

Neh 7:47 sons of Keros, sons of Sia, sons of Padon,

Neh 7:48 sons of Lebana, sons of Hagaba, sons of Shalmai,

Neh 7:49 sons of Hanan, sons of Giddel, sons of Gahar,

Neh 7:50 sons of Reaiah, sons of Rezin, sons of Nekoda,

Neh 7:51 sons of Gazzam, sons of Uzza, sons of Paseah,

Neh 7:52 sons of Besai, sons of the Meunites, sons of the Nephusites,

Neh 7:53 sons of Bakbuk, sons of Hakupha, sons of Harhur,

Neh 7:54 sons of Bazlith, sons of Mehida, sons of Harsha,

Neh 7:55 sons of Barkos, sons of Sisera, sons of Temah,

Neh 7:56 sons of Nezaiah, sons of Hatipha.

Neh 7:57 The sons of Solomon’s slaves: sons of Sotai, sons of Sophereth, sons of Perida,

Neh 7:58 sons of Jaala, sons of Darkon, sons of Giddel,

Neh 7:59 sons of Shephatiah, sons of Hattil, sons of Pochereth-ha-Zebaim, sons of Amon.

Neh 7:60 The total of the temple slaves and the sons of Solomon’s slaves: three hundred and ninety-two.

Neh 7:61 The following, who came from Tel-Melah, Tel-Harsha, Cherub, Addon and Immer, could not prove that
their families and ancestry were of Israelite origin:

Neh 7:62 the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda: six hundred and forty-two.

Neh 7:63 And among the priests: the sons of Hobaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, the sons of Barzillai — who had
married one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, whose name he adopted.

Neh 7:64 These had looked for their entries in the official genealogies but were not to be found there, and were
hence disqualified from the priesthood.

Neh 7:65 Consequently, His Excellency forbade them to eat any of the consecrated food until a priest appeared
who could consult urim and thummim.

Neh 7:66 The whole assembly numbered forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty people,

Neh 7:67 not counting their slaves and maidservants to the number of seven thousand three hundred and thirty-
seven. They also had two hundred and forty-five male and female singers.

Neh 7:68 They had four hundred and thirty-five camels and six thousand seven hundred and twenty donkeys.
Neh 7:69 A certain number of heads of families contributed to the work. His Excellency contributed one
thousand gold drachmas, fifty bowls, and thirty priestly robes to the fund.

Neh 7:70 And heads of families gave twenty thousand gold drachmas and two thousand two hundred silver
minas to the work fund.

Neh 7:71 The gifts made by the rest of the people amounted to twenty thousand gold drachmas, two thousand
silver minas, and sixty-seven priestly robes.

Neh 7:72 The priests, the Levites and some of the people lived in Jerusalem and thereabouts; the singers, the
gatekeepers, and the temple slaves in their appropriate towns; and all the other Israelites, in their own towns.
Now when the seventh month came round — the Israelites being in their towns-

Neh 8:1 all the people gathered as one man in the square in front of the Water Gate, and asked the scribe Ezra
to bring the Book of the Law of Moses which Yahweh had prescribed for Israel.

Neh 8:2 Accordingly, on the first day of the seventh month, the priest Ezra brought the Law before the
assembly, consisting of men, women and all those old enough to understand.

Neh 8:3 In the square in front of the Water Gate, in the presence of the men and women, and of those old
enough to understand, he read from the book from dawn until noon; all the people listened attentively to the Book
of the Law.

Neh 8:4 The scribe Ezra stood on a wooden dais erected for the purpose; beside him stood, on his right,
Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah and Maaseiah; on his left, Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum,
Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam.

Neh 8:5 In full view of all the people — since he stood higher than them all — Ezra opened the book; and when
he opened it, all the people stood up.

Neh 8:6 Then Ezra blessed Yahweh, the great God, and all the people raised their hands and answered, “Amen!
Amen!”; then they bowed down and, face to the ground, prostrated themselves before Yahweh.

Neh 8:7 And Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabab,
Hanan, Pelaiah, who were Levites, explained the Law to the people, while the people all kept their places.

Neh 8:8 Ezra read from the book of the Law of God, translating and giving the sense; so the reading was



understood,

Neh 8:9 Then His Excellency Nehemiah and the priest-scribe Ezra and the Levites who were instructing the
people said to all the people, “Today is sacred to Yahweh your God. Do not be mournful, do not weep”. For the
people were all in tears as they listened to the words of the Law.

Neh 8:10 He then said, “You may go; eat what is rich, drink what is sweet and send a helping to the man who
has nothing prepared. For today is sacred to our Lord. Do not be sad: the joy of Yahweh is your stronghold”.

Neh 8:1 1 And the Levites calmed all the people down, saying, “Keep quiet; this is a sacred day. Do not be sad”.
Neh 8:12 Then all the people went off to eat and drink and give helpings away and enjoy themselves to the full,
since they had understood the meaning of what had been proclaimed to them.

Neh 8:13 On the second day, the heads of families of the whole people, and the priests and Levites, gathered
round the scribe Ezra to study the words of the Law.

Neh 8:14 And written in the Law that Yahweh had prescribed through Moses they found that the Israelites were
to live in shelters during the feast of the seventh month.

Neh 8:15 So they issued a proclamation and had it circulated in all their towns and in Jerusalem: “Go into the
hills and bring branches of olive, pine, myrtle, palm and other leafy trees to make shelters, as it says in the book”.
Neh 8:16 The people went out; they brought branches and made shelters for themselves, each man on his roof,
in their courtyards, in the precincts of the Temple of God, in the square of the Water Gate and in the square of
the Ephraim Gate.

Neh 8:17 The whole assembly, all who had returned from the captivity, put up shelters and lived in them; this
the Israelites had not done from the days of Joshua son of Nun until that day, and there was very great
merrymaking.

Neh 8:18 Each day, from the first day to the last one, Ezra read from the Book of the Law of God. They
celebrated the feast for seven days; on the eighth day, as prescribed, they held a solemn assembly.

Neh 9:1 On the twenty-fourth day of this month the Israelites, in sackcloth and with dust on their heads,
assembled for a fast.

Neh 9:2 Then those of Israelite stock who had severed relations with all foreigners stood up and confessed their
sins and the iniquities of their ancestors.

Neh 9:3 Standing, each man in his place, they read from the Book of the Law of Yahweh their God for one
quarter of the day; for another quarter they confessed their sins and worshipped Yahweh their God.

Neh 9:4 On the Levites’ platform stood Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani and
Chenani, calling to Yahweh their God in ringing tones.

Neh 9:5 The Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah and Pethahiah said,
“Stand up and bless Yahweh your God! “Blessed are you, Yahweh our God from everlasting to everlasting, and
blessed be your glorious name, surpassing all blessing and praise!

Neh 9:6 “You, Yahweh, are the one, only Yahweh, you have created the heavens, the heaven of heavens and
all their array, the earth and all it bears, the seas and all they hold. To all of them you give life, and the array of
heaven worships you.

Neh 9:7 “You are Yahweh God, who chose Abram, brought him out of Ur in Chaldaea and changed his name to
Abraham.

Neh 9:8 Finding his heart was faithful to you, you made a covenant with him, to give the country of the
Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites and the Girgashites to him and his
descendants. And you have made good your promises, for you are upright.

Neh 9:9 “You saw the distress of our ancestors in Egypt, you heard their cry by the Sea of Reeds.

Neh 9:10 You displayed signs and wonders against Pharaoh, against all his servants and all the people of his
land; for you knew how arrogantly they treated them. You won a reputation which you keep to this day.

Neh 9:1 1 You opened up the sea in front of them: they walked on dry ground right through the sea. Into the
depths you hurled their pursuers like a stone into the raging waters.

Neh 9:12 With a pillar of cloud you led them by day, with a pillar of fire by night: to light the way ahead of them
by which they were to go.

Neh 9:13 You came down on Mount Sinai and spoke with them from heaven; you gave them right rules, reliable
laws, good statutes and commandments;

Neh 9:14 you revealed your holy Sabbath to them; you laid down commandments, statutes and law for them
through your servant Moses.

Neh 9:15 For their hunger you gave them bread from heaven, for their thirst you brought them water out of a
rock, and you told them to go in and take possession of the country which you had sworn to give them.

Neh 9:16 “But they and our ancestors acted arrogantly, grew obstinate and flouted your commands.

Neh 9:17 They refused to obey, forgetful of the wonders which you had worked for them; they grew obstinate
and made up their minds to return to their slavery in Egypt. But because you are a forgiving God, gracious and
compassionate, patient and rich in faithful love, you did not abandon them!



Neh 9:18 “Even when they cast themselves a calf out of molten metal and said, ‘This is your God who brought
you up from Egypt!’. and committed monstrous impieties,

Neh 9:19 you, in your great compassion, did not abandon them in the desert: the pillar of cloud did not leave
them, leading them on their path by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, lighting the way ahead of them by which
they were to go.

Neh 9:20 You gave them your good spirit to instruct them, you did not withhold your manna from their mouths,
you gave them water for their thirst.

Neh 9:21 For forty years you cared for them in the desert, so that they went short of nothing, their clothes did
not wear out, nor were their feet swollen.

Neh 9:22 “You gave them kingdoms and peoples, allotting them these as frontier lands; they occupied the
country of Sihon king of Heshbon, and the country of Og king of Bashan.

Neh 9:23 You gave them as many children as there are stars in the sky, and brought them into the country
which you had promised their ancestors that they would enter and possess.

Neh 9:24 The children entered and took possession of the country and before them you subdued the country’s
inhabitants, the Canaanites, whom you put at their mercy, with their kings and the peoples of the country, for
them to treat as they pleased;

Neh 9:25 they captured fortified towns and a fertile countryside, they took possession of houses stocked with all
kinds of goods, of storage-wells ready-hewn, of vineyards, olive groves and fruit trees in profusion; so they ate,
were full, grew fat and revelled in your great goodness.

Neh 9:26 “But they grew disobedient, rebelled against you and thrust your law behind their backs; they
slaughtered your prophets who had reproved them to bring them back to you, and committed monstrous
impieties.

Neh 9:27 So you put them at the mercy of their enemies who oppressed them. But when they were being
oppressed and called to you, you heard them from heaven and because of your great compassion you gave
them deliverers who rescued them from their oppressors’ clutches.

Neh 9:28 But once at peace again, again they did what was wrong before you; so you put them at the mercy of
their enemies who then became their rulers. When they called to you again, you heard them from heaven and,
because of your compassion, rescued them many times.

Neh 9:29 You warned them, to bring them back to your law, but they became arrogant, did not obey your
commandments and sinned against your rules, in whose observance is life; they turned a stubborn shoulder,
were obstinate, and disobeyed.

Neh 9:30 You were patient with them for many years and warned them by your spirit through your prophets, but
they would not listen; so you put them at the mercy of the people of the country.

Neh 9:31 But, because of your great compassion, you did not destroy them completely nor abandon them, for
you are a gracious, compassionate God.

Neh 9:32 Now, our God — the great God, the Mighty and Awe-inspiring One, maintaining the covenant and your
faithful love- count as no small thing this misery which has befallen us, our kings, our princes, our priests, our
prophets, and all your people from the times of the Assyrian kings to the present day.

Neh 9:33 You have been upright in all that has happened to us, for you acted faithfully, while we did wrong.

Neh 9:34 Our kings, our princes, our priests and our ancestors did not keep your law or pay attention to your
commandments and obligations which you imposed upon them.

Neh 9:35 Even in their own kingdom, despite your great goodness which you bestowed on them, despite the
wide and fertile country which you had lavished on them, they did not serve you or renounce their evil deeds.
Neh 9:36 See, we are slaves today, slaves in the country which you gave to our ancestors for them to eat the
good things it produces.

Neh 9:37 Its abundant produce goes to the kings whom, for our sins, you have set over us, who rule over our
persons and over our cattle as they please. We are in great distress”.

Neh 10:1 In view of all this we make a firm agreement, in writing. Our princes, our Levites, our priests and the
rest of the people have put their names to the document under seal.

Neh 10:2 On the sealed document were the names of: Nehemiah, son of Hacaliah, and Zedekiah;

Neh 10:3 Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah,

Neh 10:4 Pashhur, Amariah, Malchijah,

Neh 10:5 Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch,

Neh 10:6 Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah,

Neh 10:7 Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch,

Neh 10:8 Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin,

Neh 10:9 Maaziah, Bilgai, Shemaiah: these were the priests.

Neh 10:10 The Levites were: Jeshua son of Azaniah, Binnui of the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel,

Neh 10:1 1 and their kinsmen Shebaniah, Hodaviah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan,



Neh 10:12 Mica, Rehob, Hashabiah,

Neh 10:13 Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah,

Neh 10:14 Hodiah, Bani, Chenani.

Neh 10:15 The leaders of the people were: Parosh, Pahath-Moab, Elam, Zattu, Bani,

Neh 10:16 Bunni, Azgad, Bebai,

Neh 10:17 Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin,

Neh 10:18 Ater, Hezekiah, Azzur,

Neh 10:19 Hodiah, Hashum, Bezai,

Neh 10:20 Hariph, Anathoth, Nebai,

Neh 10:21 Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir,

Neh 10:22 Meshezabel, Zadok, Jaddua,

Neh 10:23 Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah,

Neh 10:24 Hoshea, Hananiah, Hasshub,

Neh 10:25 Hallohesh, Pilha, Shobek,

Neh 10:27 Ahijah, Hanan, Anan,

Neh 10:28 Malluch, Harim, Baanah.

Neh 10:29 And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the temple slaves
and all those who had severed relations with the people of the country to adhere to the law of God, as also their
wives, their sons, their daughters, that is, all those who had reached the age of discretion,

Neh 1 0:30 have joined their esteemed brothers in a solemn oath to follow the law of God given through Moses,
servant of God, and to observe and practise all the commandments of Yahweh our Lord, with his rules and his
statutes.

Neh 1 0:31 We will not give our daughters in marriage to the peoples of the country, nor allow their daughters to
marry our sons.

Neh 1 0:32 If the people of the country bring goods or foodstuff of any kind to sell on the Sabbath day, we will
buy nothing from them on Sabbath or holy day. In the seventh year, we will forgo the produce of the soil and the
exaction of all debts.

Neh 10:33 We recognise the following obligations: to give one-third of a shekel yearly for the service of the
Temple of our God:

Neh 10:34 for the loaves of permanent offering, for the perpetual oblation, for the perpetual burnt offering, for
the sacrifices on Sabbaths, on New Moons and on festivals, for the consecrated gifts, the sin offerings to expiate
for Israel, in short, for the whole work of the Temple of our God;

Neh 1 0:35 Furthermore, as regards deliveries of wood for burning on the altar of our God as the law prescribes,
we have arranged, by drawing lots, how these deliveries are to be made at the Temple of our God by the priests,
the Levites and the people by families, at stated times every year. We will no longer neglect the Temple of our
God.

Neh 10:36 and further, to bring yearly to the Temple of our God the first-fruits of our soil and the first-fruits of all
our orchards,

Neh 10:37 also the first-born of our sons and of our cattle, as the law prescribes, the first-born of our herds and
flocks should be taken to the Temple of our God for the priests officiating in the Temple of our God.

Neh 1 0:38 Furthermore, we shall bring the best of our dough, of every kind of fruit, of the new wine and of the oil
to the priests, to the storerooms of the Temple of our God, and the tithe on our soil to the Levites — the Levites
will themselves collect the tithes from all the towns of our religion.

Neh 10:39 An Aaronite priest will accompany the Levites when they collect the tithes, and the Levites will bring
a tenth part

Neh 10:40 a, b of the tithes to the Temple of our God, into the treasury storerooms; for these rooms are where
the Israelites and the Levites are to bring the contributions of corn, wine and oil, and where the vessels of the
sanctuary are, and the officiating priests, the gatekeepers and the singers.

Neh 11:1 Now the leaders of the people took up residence in Jerusalem; so the rest of the people drew lots: one
man in ten was to come and live in Jerusalem, the holy city, while the other nine were to stay in the towns
outside.

Neh 1 1 :2 The people praised all those who volunteered to live in Jerusalem.

Neh 11:3 In the towns of Judah each man lived on his own property, but these are the provincial leaders, the
Israelites, the priests, the Levites, the temple slaves and the descendants of Solomon’s slaves, who made their
homes in Jerusalem:

Neh 1 1 :4 Of the sons of Judah and the sons of Benjamin who made their homes in Jerusalem there were: Of
the sons of Judah: Athaiah son of Uzziah, son of Zechariah, son of Amariah, son of Shephatiah, son of
Mehalalel, of the descendants of Perez;



Neh 1 1 :5 and Maaseiah son of Baruch, son of Col-Hozeh, son of Hazaiah, son of Adaiah, son of Joiarib, son of
Zechariah, descendant of Shelah.

Neh 1 1 :6 The total number of the descendants of Perez living in Jerusalem was four hundred and sixty-eight
outstanding people.

Neh 1 1 :7 These are the sons of Benjamin: Sallu son of Meshullam, son of Joed, son of Pedaiah, son of Kolaiah,
son of Maaseiah, son of Ithiel, son of Jeshaiah,

Neh 1 1 :8 and his brothers Gabbai and Sallai; nine hundred and twenty-eight.

Neh 1 1 :9 Joel son of Zichri was their chief, and Judah son of Hassenuah was second in command of the city.
Neh 11:10 Of the priests there were Jedaiah son of Joiakim, son of

Neh 11:11 Seraiah, son of Hilkiah, son of Meshullam, son ofZadok, son of Meraioth, son of Ahitub, the chief of
the Temple of God,

Neh 11:12 and their kinsmen who performed the Temple liturgy: eight hundred and twenty-two; Adaiah son of
Jeroham, son of Pelaliah, son of Amzi, son of Zechariah, son of Pashhur, son of Malchijah,

Neh 11:13 and his kinsfolk, heads of families: two hundred and forty-two; and Amashai son of Azarel, son of
Ahzai, son of Meshillemoth, son of Immer,

Neh 1 1:14 and his kinsfolk, outstanding people: one hundred and twenty-eight. Their chief was Zabdiel son of
Haggadol.

Neh 11:15 Of the Levites there were Shemaiah son of Hasshub, son of Azrikam, son of Hashabiah, son of
Bunni;

Neh 11:16 Shabbethai and Jozabad, the levitical leaders responsible for work outside the Temple of God;

Neh 11:17 Mattaniah son of Mica, son of Zabdi, son of Asaph, who led the praises and intoned the thanksgiving
associated with the prayer, Bakbukiah being his junior colleague; and Obadiah son of Shammua, son of Galal,
son of Jeduthun.

Neh 11:18 The total number of Levites in the holy city was two hundred and eighty-four.

Neh 11:19 The gatekeepers: Akkub, Talmon and their kinsmen, who kept watch at the gates: one hundred and
seventy-two.

Neh 1 1 :20 The rest of Israel, including the priests and Levites, made their homes throughout the towns of
Judah, each man on his own inheritance,

Neh 1 1 :21 The temple slaves lived on Ophel; Ziha and Gishpa were in charge of the temple slaves.

Neh 1 1 :22 The official in charge of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi son of Bani, son of Hashabiah, son of
Mattaniah, son of Mica, of the sons of Asaph, who led the singing in the liturgy of the Temple of God;

Neh 1 1 :23 for the singers were under royal orders, with regulations laying down what was required of them day
by day.

Neh 1 1 :24 Petahiah son of Meshezabel, of the sons of Zerah son of Judah, was the king’s minister for all
matters connected with the people.

Neh 1 1 :25 and in the villages near their lands. Some of the sons of Judah made their homes in Kiriath-Arba and
its dependencies, Dibon and its dependencies, Jekabzeel and its dependencies,

Neh 11:26 Jeshua, Moladah, Beth-Pelet,

Neh 1 1 .21 Hazar-Shual, Beersheba and its dependencies,

Neh 11:28 Ziklag, Meconah and its dependencies,

Neh 1 1 :29 En-Rimmon, Zorah, Jarmuth,

Neh 1 1 :30 Zanoah, Adullam and their villages, Lachish and its lands, and Azekah and its dependencies; thus,
they settled from Beersheba as far as the Valley of Hinnom.

Neh 1 1 :31 And some Benjaminites made their homes in Geba, Michmash, Aija, Bethel and its dependencies,
Neh 11:32 Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah,

Neh 11:33 Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim,

Neh 11:34 Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat,

Neh 1 1 :35 Lod, Ono and the Valley of Craftsmen.

Neh 1 1 :36 Some levitical groups lived in Judah, some in Benjamin.

Neh 12:1 These are the priests and the Levites who came back with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua:
Neh 12:2 Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,

Neh 12:3 Amariah, Malluch, Hattush, Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,

Neh 12:4 Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah,

Neh 12:5 Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,

Neh 12:6 Shemaiah, and Joiarib, Jedaiah,

Neh 1 2:7 Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah — these were the heads of the priests and their kinsmen in the days of
Jeshua.

Neh 12:8 The Levites were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, Mattaniah — this last, with his brothers,
was in charge of the songs of praise,



Neh 12:9 while Bakbukiah and Unno, their colleagues, formed the alternate choir to theirs.

Neh 12:10 Jeshua fathered Joiakim, Joiakim fathered Eliashib, Eliashib fathered Joiada,

Neh 12:1 1 Joiada fathered Johanan, and Johanan fathered Jaddua.

Neh 12:12 In the days of Joiakim the heads of the priestly families were: family of Seraiah, Meraiah; of
Jeremiah, Hananiah;

Neh 12:13 of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;

Neh 12:14 of Malluch, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;

Neh 12:15 of Harim, Adna; of Meremoth, Helkai;

Neh 12:16 of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;

Neh 12:17 of Abijah, Zichri; of Minjamin, . . of Moadiah, Piltai;

Neh 12:18 ofBilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan;

Neh 12:19 and of Jojarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;

Neh 12:20 of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;

Neh 12:21 of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel.

Neh 12:22 In the time of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan and Jaddua, the heads of the families of priests were
registered in the Book of Chronicles, up to the reign of Darius the Persian.

Neh 12:23 The Levites who were heads of families were registered in the Book of Chronicles up to the time of
Johanan, grandson of Eliashib.

Neh 12:24 The heads of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, while their brothers
who formed an alternate choir for the hymns of praise and thanksgiving, as David, man of God, had prescribed,
section corresponding to section,

Neh 12:25 were Mattaniah, Bakbukiah and Obadiah. Meshullam, Talmon and Akkub were the gatekeepers
guarding the stores at the gates.

Neh 1 2:26 These lived in the days of Joiakim son of Jeshua, son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the
governor and of Ezra the priest-scribe.

Neh 1 2:27 At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem the Levites were sent for, wherever they lived, to come to
Jerusalem and joyfully perform the dedication with hymns of thanksgiving and songs to the accompaniment of
cymbals, lyres and harps.

Neh 12:28 Accordingly, the levitical singers assembled from the district round Jerusalem, from the villages of
the Netophathites,

Neh 1 2:29 from Beth-Gilgal and from their farms at Geba and Azmaveth — for the singers had built themselves
villages all round Jerusalem.

Neh 12:30 When the priests and Levites had purified themselves, they then purified the people, the gates and
the wall.

Neh 1 2:31 I then made the leaders of Judah come on to the top of the wall and appointed two large choirs. One
made its way along the top of the wall, to the right, towards the Dung Gate;

Neh 1 2:32 bringing up the rear were Hoshaiah and half the leaders of Judah,

Neh 12:33 and also Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,

Neh 12:34 Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah and Jeremiah,

Neh 12:35 of the priests, with trumpets; then Zechariah son of Jonathan, son of Shemaiah, son of Mattaniah,
son of Micaiah, son of Zaccur, son of Asaph,

Neh 12:36 with his kinsmen, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Juda, Hanani, with the musical
instruments of David, man of God. The scribe Ezra walked at their head.

Neh 12:37 At the Fountain Gate they went straight on up the steps of the City of David, along the top of the
rampart by the stairway of the wall, above the Palace of David as far as the Water Gate, on the east.

Neh 12:38 The other choir made its way to the left; I and half the leaders of the people followed them along the
top of the wall from the Tower of the Furnaces to the Broad Wall,

Neh 12:39 from the Ephraim Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred as far as
the Sheep Gate, and they came to a halt at the Prison Gate.

Neh 12:40 The two choirs then took their places in the Temple of God. But I had half the magistrates with me
Neh 12:41 as well as the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, Hananiah with the
trumpets,

Neh 12:42 and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam and Ezer. The singers sang
loudly under the direction of Jezrahiah.

Neh 12:43 There were great sacrifices offered that day and the people rejoiced, God having given them good
cause for rejoicing; the women and children rejoiced too, and the joy of Jerusalem could be heard from far away.
Neh 12:44 For the rooms intended for the treasures, contributions, first-fruits and tithes, supervisors were then
appointed whose business it was to collect in them those portions from the town lands awarded by the Law to
the priests and Levites. For Judah rejoiced in the officiating priests and Levites,



Neh 12:45 since they — with the singers and gatekeepers — performed the liturgy of their God and the rites of
purification as ordained by David and his son Solomon.

Neh 1 2:46 For from ancient times, from the days of David and Asaph, they had been the leaders in rendering
hymns of praise and thanksgiving to God.

Neh 1 2:47 In the days of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah, all Israel supplied regular daily portions for the singers and
gatekeepers, and gave the dedicated contributions to the Levites; and the Levites gave the dedicated
contributions to the Aaronites.

Neh 13:1 At that time they were reading to the people from the Book of Moses, when they found this written in it,
“No Ammonite or Moabite is to be admitted to the assembly of God, and this is for all time,

Neh 13:2 since they did not come to meet the Israelites with bread and water, and even hired Balaam to oppose
them by cursing them; but our God turned the curse into a blessing”.

Neh 13:3 Having heard the Law, they excluded all foreigners from Israel.

Neh 13:4 Earlier, Eliashib the priest, who was in charge of the rooms of the Temple of our God, and who was
close to Tobiah,

Neh 13:5 had provided him with a large room where they previously used to store the meal offerings, incense,
utensils, tithes of corn, wine and oil, that is, the part of the Levites, singers and gatekeepers, and the
contributions for the priests.

Neh 13:6 While all this was going on I was away from Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king
of Babylon I had gone to see the king. But after some time I asked the king for permission to leave,

Neh 13:7 and returned to Jerusalem, where I learned about the crime which Eliashib had committed for Tobiah’s
benefit, by providing him with a room in the courts of the Temple of God.

Neh 13:8 I was extremely displeased and threw all Tobiah’s household goods out of the room and into the
street.

Neh 13:9 I then gave orders for the room to be purified, and had the utensils of the Temple of God, the meal
offerings and the incense, all replaced.

Neh 13:10 I also learned that the Levites had not been receiving their allocations, as a result of which the
Levites and singers who performed the liturgy had all withdrawn to their farms.

Neh 13:1 1 I then reprimanded the officials. “Why is the Temple of God deserted?”. I asked. And I collected them
together again and brought them back to their posts;

Neh 13:12 and all Judah then delivered the tithe of corn, wine and oil to the storehouses.

Neh 13:13 As supervisors of the storehouses I appointed Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, Pedaiah one
of the Levites and, as their assistant, Hanan son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah, since they were considered
reliable people; their duty was to make the distributions to their kinsmen.

Neh 13:14 Remember me for this, my God, and do not blot out the good deeds which I have done for the
Temple of my God and its observances!

Neh 13:15 At the same time I saw people in Judah treading the winepress, bringing in sacks of grain and
loading donkeys on the Sabbath; they were also bringing wine, grapes, figs and every kind of merchandise into
Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. So I forbade them to sell the food.

Neh 13:16 Tyrians living there were bringing in fish and every kind of merchandise which they were selling to
the Judaeans on the Sabbath in Jerusalem itself.

Neh 13:17 So I also reprimanded the leading men of Judah, saying to them, “What a wicked way to behave,
profaning the Sabbath day!

Neh 13:18 Was this not exactly what your ancestors did, with the result that our God brought all this misery
down on us and on this city? And now you are adding to the wrath hanging over Israel by profaning the Sabbath
yourselves!”.

Neh 13:19 So when the gates of Jerusalem were getting dark at the approach of the Sabbath, I gave orders for
the doors to be shut and directed that they were not to be opened again until the Sabbath was over. I stationed
some of my attendants at the gates to make sure that no merchandise was brought in on the Sabbath day.

Neh 13:20 So the traders and dealers in goods of all kinds spent the night outside Jerusalem once or twice,

Neh 13:21 until I reprimanded them. I said to them, “Why are you spending the night in front of the wall? Do it
again, and I shall use force on you”. After this, they did not come on the Sabbath.

Neh 13:22 I then ordered the Levites to purify themselves and act as guards at the gates, so that the Sabbath
day might be kept holy. Remember this also to my credit, have pity on me in the greatness of your faithful love.
Neh 13:23 At that time too, I saw Jews who had married wives from Ashdod, Ammon and Moab;

Neh 1 3:24 as regards their children, half of them spoke the language of Ashdod or the language of one of the
other peoples, but could no longer speak the language of Judah.

Neh 13:25 I reprimanded them, I cursed them, I struck several of them and tore out their hair and adjured them
by God, “You are not to give your daughters in marriage to their sons or let their daughters marry your sons, or
marry them yourselves!



Neh 13:26 Was it not because of women like these that Solomon king of Israel sinned? Although among many
nations there was no king like him and he was loved by his God, and God made him king of all Israel, even then
foreign women led him into sinning!

Neh 13:27 Were you obedient when you committed this very grave crime: breaking faith with our God by
marrying foreign wives?”.

Neh 1 3:28 One of the sons of Jehoiada, son of Eliashib the high priest, was a son-in-law of Sanballat the
Horonite; I drove him from my presence.

Neh 1 3:29 Remember them, my God, for having defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priests and
Levites!

Neh 13:30 And so I purged them of everything foreign; I drew up regulations for the priests and Levites, defining
each man’s duty,

Neh 1 3:31 as well as for the deliveries of wood at the proper times, and for the first-fruits. Remember this, my
God, to my credit!


Est 1:1 It was in the days of Ahasuerus, the Ahasuerus whose empire stretched from India to Ethiopia and
comprised one hundred and twenty-seven provinces, (a) In the second year of the reign of the Great King,
Ahasuerus, on the first day of Nisan, a dream came to Mordecai son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, of the
tribe of Benjamin, (b) a Jew living at Susa and holding high office at the royal court, (c) He was one of the
captives whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had deported from Jerusalem with Jeconiah king of Judah, (d)
This was his dream. There were cries and noise, thunder and earthquakes, and disorder over the whole earth.

(e) Then two great dragons came forward, each ready for the fray, and set up a great roar, (f) At the sound of
them every nation made ready to wage war against the nation of the just, (g) A day of darkness and gloom, of
affliction and distress, oppression and great disturbance on earth! (h) The entire upright nation was thrown into
consternation at the fear of the evils awaiting it and prepared for death, crying out to God. (i) Then from its cry,
as from a little spring, there grew a great river, a flood of water, (j) Light came as the sun rose, and the humble
were raised up and devoured the mighty, (k) On awakening from this dream and vision of God’s designs,
Mordecai thought deeply about the matter, trying his best all day to discover what its meaning might be. (I)
Mordecai was lodging at court with Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs who guarded the palace, (m)
Having got wind of their plotting and gained knowledge of their designs, he discovered that they were preparing
to assassinate King Ahasuerus, and he warned the king against them, (n) The king gave orders for the two
officers to be tortured; they confessed and were executed, (o) He then had these events entered in his Record
Book, while Mordecai himself also wrote an account of them, (p) The king then appointed Mordecai to an office
at court and rewarded him with presents, (q) But Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, who enjoyed high
favour with the king, determined to injure Mordecai in revenge for the affair of the king’s two officers.

Est 1 :2 In those days, when King Ahasuerus was sitting on his royal throne in the citadel of Susa,

Est 1 :3 in the third year of his reign, he gave a banquet at his court for all his officers-of-state and ministers,
Persian and Median army-commanders, nobles and provincial governors.

Est 1 :4 Thus he displayed the riches and splendour of his empire and the pomp and glory of his majesty; the
festivities went on for a long time, a hundred and eighty days.

Est 1 :5 When this period was over, for seven days the king gave a banquet for all the people living in the citadel
of Susa, to high and low alike, on the esplanade in the gardens of the royal palace.

Est 1 :6 There were white and violet hangings fastened with cords of fine linen and purple thread to silver rings
on marble columns, couches of gold and silver on a pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl and precious
stones.

Est 1 :7 For drinking there were golden cups of various design and plenty of wine provided by the king with royal
liberality.

Est 1 :8 The royal edict did not, however, make drinking obligatory, the king having instructed the officials of his
household to treat each guest according to the guest’s own wishes.

Est 1 :9 Queen Vashti, for her part, gave a banquet for the women in the royal palace of King Ahasuerus.

Est 1:10 On the seventh day, when the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona,
Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar and Carkas, the seven officers in attendance on the person of King Ahasuerus,

Est 1:11 to bring Queen Vashti before the king, crowned with her royal diadem, in order to display her beauty to
the people and the officers-of-state, since she was very beautiful.

Est 1:12 But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s command delivered by the officers. The king was very
angry at this and his rage grew hot.

Est 1:13 Addressing himself to the wise men who were versed in the law — it being the practice to refer matters
affecting the king to expert lawyers and jurists-

Est 1:14 he summoned Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena and Memucan, seven Persian
and Median officers-of-state who had privileged access to the royal presence and occupied the leading positions
in the kingdom.

Est 1:15 “According to law”, he said, “what is to be done to Queen Vashti for not obeying the command of King
Ahasuerus delivered by the officers?”.

Est 1:16 In the presence of the king and the officers-of-state, Memucan replied, “Queen Vashti has wronged not
only the king but also all the officers-of-state and all the peoples inhabiting the provinces of King Ahasuerus.

Est 1:17 The queen’s conduct will soon become known to all the women, who will adopt a contemptuous



attitude towards their own husbands. They will say, ‘King Ahasuerus himself commanded Queen Vashti to
appear before him and she did not come’.

Est 1:18 Before the day is out, the wives of the Persian and Median office rs-of-state will be telling every one of
the king’s office rs-of-state what they have heard about the queen’s behaviour; and that will mean contempt and
anger all round.

Est 1:19 If it is the king’s pleasure, let him issue a royal edict, to be irrevocably incorporated into the laws of the
Persians and Medes, to the effect that Vashti is never to appear again before King Ahasuerus, and let the king
confer her royal dignity on a worthier woman.

Est 1 :20 Let this edict issued by the king be proclaimed throughout his empire — which is great — and all the
women will henceforth bow to the authority of their husbands, both high and low alike”.

Est 1 :21 This speech pleased the king and the office rs-of-state, and the king did as Memucan advised.

Est 1 :22 He sent letters to all the provinces of the kingdom, to each province in its own script and to each nation
in its own language, ensuring that every husband should be master in his own house.

Est 2:1 Some time after this, when the king’s wrath had subsided, Ahasuerus remembered Vashti, how she had
behaved, and the measures taken against her.

Est 2:2 The king’s gentlemen-in-waiting said, “A search should be made on the king’s behalf for beautiful young
virgins,

Est 2:3 and the king appoint commissioners throughout the provinces of his realm to bring all these beautiful
young virgins to the citadel of Susa, to the harem under the authority of Hegai the king’s eunuch, custodian of
the women. Here he will give them whatever they need for enhancing their beauty,

Est 2:4 and the girl who pleases the king can take Vashti’s place as queen. 1 This advice pleased the king and he
acted on it.

Est 2:5 Now in the citadel of Susa there lived a Jew called Mordecai son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, of
the tribe of Benjamin,

Est 2:6 who had been deported from Jerusalem among the captives taken away with Jeconiah king of Judah by
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,

Est 2:7 and was now bringing up a certain Hadassah, otherwise called Esther, his uncle’s daughter, who had
lost both father and mother; the girl had a good figure and a beautiful face, and on the death of her parents
Mordecai had adopted her as his daughter.

Est 2:8 On the promulgation of the royal command and edict a great number of girls were brought to the citadel
of Susa where they were entrusted to Hegai. Esther, too, was taken to the king’s palace and entrusted to Hegai,
the custodian of the women.

Est 2:9 The girl pleased him and won his favour. Not only did he quickly provide her with all she needed for her
dressing room and her meals, but he gave her seven special maids from the king’s household and transferred
her and her maids to the best part of the harem.

Est 2:10 Esther had not divulged her race or parentage, since Mordecai had forbidden her to do so.

Est 2:1 1 Mordecai walked up and down in front of the courtyard of the harem all day and every day, to learn
how Esther was and how she was being treated.

Est 2:12 Each girl had to appear in turn before King Ahasuerus after a delay of twelve months fixed by the
regulations for the women; this preparatory period was occupied as follows: six months with oil of myrrh, and six
months with spices and lotions commonly used for feminine beauty treatment.

Est 2:13 When each girl went to the king, she was given whatever she wanted to take with her, since she then
moved from the harem into the royal household.

Est 2:14 She went there in the evening, and the following morning returned to another harem entrusted to the
care of Shaashgaz, the king’s officer, custodian of the concubines. She did not go to the king any more, unless
he was particularly pleased with her and had her summoned by name.

Est 2:15 But when it was the turn of Esther the daughter of Abihail, whose nephew Mordecai had adopted her
as his own daughter, to go into the king’s presence, she did not ask for anything beyond what had been
assigned her by Hegai, the king’s officer, custodian of the women. Esther won the approval of all who saw her.
Est 2:16 She was brought to King Ahasuerus in his royal apartments in the tenth month, which is called Tebeth,
in the seventh year of his reign;

Est 2:17 and the king liked Esther better than any of the other women; none of the other girls found so much
favour and approval with him. So he set the royal diadem on her head and proclaimed her queen instead of
Vashti.

Est 2:18 The king then gave a great banquet, Esther’s banquet, for all his officers-of-state and ministers,
decreed a holiday for all the provinces and distributed largesse with royal prodigality.

Est 2:19 When Esther, like the other girls, had been transferred to the second harem,

Est 2:20 she did not divulge her parentage or race, in obedience to the orders of Mordecai, whose instructions
she continued to follow as when she had been under his care.



Est 2:21 At this time Mordecai was attached to the Chancellery and two malcontents, Bigthan and Teresh,
officers in the king’s service as Guards of the Threshold, plotted to assassinate King Ahasuerus.

Est 2:22 Mordecai came to hear of this and informed Queen Esther, who in turn, on Mordecai’s authority, told
the king.

Est 2:23 The matter was investigated and proved to be true. The two conspirators were sent to the gallows, and
the incident was recorded in the Annals, in the royal presence.

Est 3:1 Shortly afterwards, King Ahasuerus singled out Haman son of Hammedatha, a native of Agag, for
promotion. He raised him in rank, granting him precedence over all his colleagues, the other officers-of-state,

Est 3:2 and all the royal officials employed at the Chancellery used to bow low and prostrate themselves
whenever Haman appeared — such was the king’s command. Mordecai refused either to bow or to prostrate
himself.

Est 3:3 “Why do you flout the royal command?”. the officials of the Chancellery asked Mordecai.

Est 3:4 Day after day they asked him this, but he took no notice of them. In the end they reported the matter to
Haman, to see whether Mordecai would persist in his attitude, since he had told them that he was a Jew.

Est 3:5 Haman could see for himself that Mordecai did not bow or prostrate himself in his presence; he became
furiously angry.

Est 3:6 And, on being told what race Mordecai belonged to, he thought it beneath him merely to get rid of
Mordecai, but made up his mind to wipe out all the members of Mordecai’s race, the Jews, living in Ahasuerus’
entire empire.

Est 3:7 In the first month, that is the month of Nisan, of the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, the pur (that is, the
lot) was cast in Haman’s presence, to determine the day and the month. The lot falling on the twelfth month,
which is Adar,

Est 3:8 Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a certain unassimilated nation scattered among the other
nations throughout the provinces of your realm; their laws are different from those of all the other nations, and
the royal laws they ignore; hence it is not in the king’s interests to tolerate them.

Est 3:9 If their destruction be signed, so please the king, I am ready to pay ten thousand talants of silver to the
king’s receivers, to be credited to the royal treasury”.

Est 3:10 The king then took his signet ring off his hand and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha, the
persecutor of the Jews.

Est 3:1 1 “Keep the money”, he said, “and you can have the people too; do what you like with them”.

Est 3:12 The royal scribes were therefore summoned for the thirteenth day of the first month, when they wrote
out the orders addressed by Haman to the king’s satraps, to the governors ruling each province and to the
principal officials of each people, to each province in its own script and to each people in its own language. The
edict was signed in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with his ring,

Est 3:13 and letters were sent by runners to every province of the realm, ordering the destruction, slaughter and
annihilation of all Jews, young and old, including women and children, on the same day — the thirteenth day of
the twelfth month, which is Adar — and the seizing of their possessions, (a) The text of the letter was as follows:
“The Great King, Ahasuerus, to the governors of the hundred and twenty-seven provinces stretching from India
to Ethiopia, and to their subordinate district commissioners: (b) “Being placed in authority over many nations and
ruling the whole world, I have resolved never to be carried away by the insolence of power, but always to rule
with moderation and clemency, so as to assure for my subjects a life ever free from storms and, offering my
kingdom the benefits of civilisation and free transit from end to end, to restore that peace which all men desire.

(c) In consultation with our advisers as to how this aim is to be effected, we have been informed by one of them,
eminent among us for prudence and well proved for his unfailing devotion and unshakeable trustworthiness, and
in rank second only to our majesty, Haman by name, (d) that there is, mingled among all the tribes of the earth, a
certain ill-disposed people, opposed by its laws to every other nation and continually defying the royal
ordinances, in such a way as to obstruct that form of government assured by us to the general good, (e)
“Considering therefore that this people, unique of its kind, is in complete opposition to all humanity from which it
differs by its outlandish laws, that it is hostile to our interests and that it commits the most heinous crimes, to the
point of endangering the stability of the realm: (f) “We command that those persons designated to you in the
letters written by Haman, who was appointed to watch over our interests and is a second father to us, be all
destroyed, root and branch, including women and children, by the swords of their enemies, without any pity or
mercy, on the fourteenth day of the twelfth month, Adar, of the present year, (g) so that, these past and present
malcontents being in one day forcibly thrown down to Hades, our government may henceforward enjoy perpetual
stability and peace”.

Est 3:14 Copies of this decree, to be promulgated as law in each province, were published to the various
peoples, so that each might be ready for the day aforementioned.

Est 3:15 At the king’s command, the runners set out with all speed; the decree was first promulgated in the
citadel of Susa. While the king and Haman gave themselves up to feasting and drinking, consternation reigned in



the city of Susa.

Est 4:1 When Mordecai learned what had happened, he tore his garments and put on sackcloth and ashes.

Then he walked into the centre of the city, wailing loudly and bitterly,

Est 4:2 until he arrived in front of the Chancellery, which no one clothed in sackcloth was allowed to enter.

Est 4:3 And in every province, no sooner had the royal command and edict arrived, than among the Jews there
was great mourning, fasting, weeping and wailing, and many lay on sackcloth and ashes.

Est 4:4 When Queen Esther’s maids and officers came and told her, she was overcome with grief. She sent
clothes for Mordecai to put on instead of his sackcloth, but he refused them.

Est 4:5 Esther then summoned Hathach, an officer whom the king had appointed to wait on her, and ordered
him to go to Mordecai and enquire what the matter was and why he was acting in this way.

Est 4:6 Hathach went out to Mordecai in the city square in front of the Chancellery,

Est 4:7 and Mordecai told him what had happened to him personally, and also about the sum of money which
Haman had offered to pay into the royal treasury to procure the destruction of the Jews.

Est 4:8 He also gave him a copy of the edict of extermination published in Susa for him to show Esther for her
information, with the message that she was to go to the king and implore his favour and plead with him for the
race to which she belonged, (a) “Remember your humbler circumstances”, he said, “when you were fed by my
hand. Since Haman, the second person in the realm, has petitioned the king for our deaths, (b) invoke the Lord,
speak to the king for us and save us from death!”.

Est 4:9 Hathach came back and told Esther what Mordecai had said;

Est 4:10 and she replied with the following message for Mordecai,

Est 4:11 “Royal officials and people living in the provinces alike all know that for anyone, man or woman, who
approaches the king in the private apartments without having been summoned there, there is only one law: he
must die, unless the king, by pointing his golden sceptre towards him, grants him his life. And I have not been
summoned to the king for the last thirty days”.

Est 4:12 These words of Esther were reported to Mordecai,

Est 4:13 who sent back the following reply, “Do not suppose that, because you are in the king’s palace, you are
going to be the one Jew to escape.

Est 4:14 No; if you persist in remaining silent at such a time, relief and deliverance will come to the Jews from
another quarter, but both you and your father’s whole family will perish. Who knows? Perhaps you have come to
the throne for just such a time as this”.

Est 4:15 Whereüpon Esther sent this reply to Mordecai,

Est 4:16 “Go and assemble all the Jews now in Susa and fast for me. Do not eat or drink day or night for three
days. For my part, I and my waiting-women shall keep the same fast, after which I shall go to the king in spite of
the law; and if I perish, I perish”.

Est 4:17 Mordecai went away and carried out Esther’s instructions, (a) Then calling to mind all the wonderful
works of the Lord, he offered this prayer: (b) Lord, Lord, Almighty King, everything is subject to your power, and
there is no one who can withstand you in your determination to save Israel, (c) You have made heaven and
earth, and all the marvels that are under heaven. You are the Master of the universe and no one can resist you,
Lord, (d) You know all things, you, Lord, know that neither pride, self-esteem nor vainglory prompted me to do
what I have done: to refuse to prostrate myself before proud Haman. Gladly would I have kissed the soles of his
feet, had this assured the safety of Israel, (e) But what I have done, I have done, rather than place the glory of a
man above the glory of God; and I shall not prostrate myself to anyone except, Lord, to you, and, in so doing, I
shall not be acting in pride, (f) And now, Lord God, King, God of Abraham spare your people! For our ruin is
being plotted, there are plans to destroy your ancient heritage, (g) Do not overlook your inheritance, which you
redeemed from Egypt to be yours, (h) Hear my supplication, have mercy on your heritage, and turn our grief into
rejoicing, so that we may live, Lord, to hymn your name. Do not suffer the mouths of those who praise you to
perish, (i) And all Israel cried out with all their might, since death was staring them in the face, (k) Queen Esther
also took refuge with the Lord in the mortal peril which had overtaken her. She took off her sumptuous robes and
put on sorrowful mourning. Instead of expensive perfumes, she covered her head with ashes and dung. She
mortified her body severely, and the former scenes of her happiness and elegance were now littered with tresses
torn from her hair. She besought the Lord God of Israel in these words: (I) My Lord, our King, the Only One,
come to my help, for I am alone and have no helper but you and am about to take my life in my hands, (m) I
have been taught from infancy in the bosom of my family that you, Lord, have chosen Israel out of all the nations
and our ancestors out of all before them, to be your heritage for ever; and that you have treated them as you
promised, (n) But we have sinned against you and you have handed us over to our enemies for paying honour to
their gods. Lord, you are upright, (o) But they are not satisfied with the bitterness of our slavery: they have
pledged themselves to their idols to abolish the decree that your own lips have uttered, to blot out your heritage,
to stop the mouths of those who praise you, to quench your altar and the glory of your House, (p) and instead to
open the mouths of the heathen, to sing the praise of worthless idols and for ever to idolise a king of flesh, (q) Do



not yield your sceptre, Lord, to what does not exist. Never let our ruin be matter for laughter. Turn these plots
against their authors, and make an example of the man who leads the attack on us. (r) Remember, Lord; reveal
yourself in the time of our distress. As for me, give me courage, King of gods and Master of all powers! (s) Put
persuasive words into my mouth when I face the lion; change his feeling into hatred for our enemy, so that he
may meet his end, and all those like him! (t) As for ourselves, save us by your hand, and come to my help, for I
am alone and have no one but you, Lord, (u) You have knowledge of all things, and you know that I hate
honours from the godless, that I loathe the bed of the uncircumcised, of any foreigner whatever, (w) You know I
am under constraint, that I loathe the symbol of my high position bound round my brow when I appear at court; I
loathe it as if it were a filthy rag and do not wear it on my days of leisure, (x) Your servant has not eaten at
Haman’s table, nor taken pleasure in the royal banquets, nor drunk the wine of libations, (y) Nor has your
servant found pleasure from the day of her promotion until now except in you, Lord, God of Abraham, (z) O God,
whose strength prevails over all, listen to the voice of the desperate, save us from the hand of the wicked, and
free me from my fear!

Est 5:1 (a) On the third day, when she had finished praying, she took off her suppliant’s mourning attire and
dressed herself in her full splendour. Radiant as she then appeared, she invoked God who watches over all
people and saves them. With her, she took two ladies-in-waiting. With a delicate air she leaned on one, while the
other accompanied her carrying her train, (b) Rosy with the full flush of her beauty, her face radiated joy and
love: but her heart shrank with fear, (c) Having passed through door after door, she found herself in the presence
of the king. He was sitting on his royal throne, dressed in all his robes of state, glittering with gold and precious
stones — a formidable sight, (d) He looked up, afire with majesty and, blazing with anger, saw her. The queen
sank to the floor. As she fainted, the colour drained from her face and her head fell against the lady-in-waiting
beside her. (e) But God changed the king’s heart, inducing a milder spirit. He sprang from his throne in alarm
and took her in his arms until she recovered, comforting her with soothing words, (f) “What is the matter, Esther?”.
he said. “I am your brother. Take heart, you are not going to die; our order applies only to ordinary people. Come
to me”. (g) And raising his golden sceptre he laid it on Esther’s neck, embraced her and said, “Speak to me”.

Est 5:2 (a) “Sire”, she said, “to me you looked like one of God’s angels, and my heart was moved with fear of
your majesty. For you are a figure of wonder, my lord, and your face is full of graciousness”. (b) But as she spoke
she fell down in a faint. The king grew more agitated, and his courtiers all set about reviving her.

Est 5:3 “What is the matter, Queen Esther?”. the king said. “Tell me what you want; even if it is half my kingdom, I
grant it you”.

Est 5:4 “Would it please the king”, Esther replied, “to come with Haman today to the banquet I have prepared for
him?”.

Est 5:5 The king said, “Tell Haman to come at once, so that Esther may have her wish”.

Est 5:6 So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared and, during the banquet, the king
again said to Esther, “Tell me your request; I grant it to you. Tell me what you want; even if it is half my kingdom,
it is yours for the asking”.

Est 5:7 “What do I want, what is my request?”. Esther replied.

Est 5:8 “If I have found favour in the king’s eyes, and if it is his pleasure to grant what I ask and to agree to my
request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet I intend to give them tomorrow, and then I shall do as the
king says”.

Est 5:9 Haman left full of joy and high spirits that day; but when he saw Mordecai at the Chancellery, neither
standing up nor stirring at his approach, he felt a gust of anger.

Est 5:10 He restrained himself, however. Returning home, he sent for his friends and Zeresh his wife

Est 5:1 1 and held forth to them about his dazzling wealth, his many children, how the king had raised him to a

position of honour and promoted him over the heads of the king’s officers-of-state and ministers.

Est 5:12 “What is more”, he added, “Queen Esther has just invited me and the king — no one else except me — to
a banquet she was giving, and better still she has invited me and the king again tomorrow.

Est 5:13 But what do I care about all this when all the while I see Mordecai the Jew sitting there at the
Chancellery?”.

Est 5:14 “Have a fifty-cubit gallows run up”, said Zeresh his wife and all his friends, “and in the morning ask the
king to have Mordecai hanged on it. Then you can go with the king to the banquet, without a care in the world!”.
Delighted with this advice, Haman had the gallows erected.

Est 6:1 That night the king could not sleep; he called for the Record Book, or Annals, to be brought and read to
him.

Est 6:2 They contained an account of how Mordecai had denounced Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king’s
eunuchs serving as Guards of the Threshold, who had plotted to assassinate King Ahasuerus.

Est 6:3 “And what honour and dignity”, the king asked, “was conferred on Mordecai for this?”. “Nothing has been
done for him”, the gentlemen-in-waiting replied.

Est 6:4 The king then said, “Who is outside in the antechamber?”. Haman had, that very moment, entered the



outer antechamber of the private apartments, to ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on the gallows which he
had just put up for the purpose.

Est 6:5 So the king’s gentlemen-in-waiting replied, “It is Haman out in the antechamber”. “Bring him in”, the king
said,

Est 6:6 and, as soon as Haman came in, went on to ask, “What is the right way to treat a man whom the king
wishes to honour?”. “Whom”, thought Haman, “would the king wish to honour, if not me?”.

Est 6:7 So he replied, “If the king wishes to honour someöne,

Est 6:8 royal robes should be brought from the king’s wardrobe, and a horse from the king’s stable, sporting a
royal diadem on its head.

Est 6:9 The robes and horse should be entrusted to one of the noblest of the king’s officers-of-state, who should
then array the man whom the king wishes to honour and lead him on horseback through the city square,
proclaiming before him: ‘This is the way a man shall be treated whom the king wishes to honour’”.

Est 6:10 “Hurry”, the king said to Haman, “take the robes and the horse, and do everything you have just said to
Mordecai the Jew, who works at the Chancellery. On no account leave out anything that you have mentioned”.
Est 6:1 1 So taking the robes and the horse, Haman arrayed Mordecai and led him on horseback through the
city square, proclaiming before him: “This is the way a man shall be treated whom the king wishes to honour”.

Est 6:12 After this Mordecai returned to the Chancellery, while Haman went hurrying home in dejection and
covering his face.

Est 6:13 He told his wife Zeresh and all his friends what had just happened. His wife Zeresh and his friends
said, “You are beginning to fall, and Mordecai to rise; if he is Jewish, you will never get the better of him. With
him against you, your fall is certain”.

Est 6:14 While they were still talking, the king’s officers arrived in a hurry to escort Haman to the banquet that
Esther was giving.

Est 7:1 The king and Haman went to Queen Esther’s banquet,

Est 7:2 and this second day, during the banquet, the king again said to Esther, “Tell me your request, Queen
Esther. I grant it to you. Whatever you want; even if it is half my kingdom, it is yours for the asking”.

Est 7:3 “If I have found favour in your eyes, O king”, Queen Esther replied, “and if it please your majesty, grant
me my life — that is my request; and the lives of my people — that is what I want.

Est 7:4 For we have been handed over, my people and I, to destruction, slaughter and annihilation; had we
merely been sold as slaves and servant-girls, I should not have said anything; but in the present case, it will be
beyond the persecutor’s means to make good the loss that the king is about to sustain”.

Est 7:5 King Ahasuerus interrupted Queen Esther, “Who is this man?”. he exclaimed. “Where is the man who has
thought of doing such a thing?”.

Est 7:6 Esther replied, “The persecutor, the enemy? Why, this wretch Haman!”. Haman quaked with terror in the
presence of the king and queen.

Est 7:7 In a rage the king got up from the banquet and went into the palace garden; while Haman, realising that
the king was determined on his ruin, stayed behind to beg Queen Esther for his life.

Est 7:8 When the king came back from the palace garden into the banqueting hall, he found Haman sprawled
across the couch where Esther was reclining. “What!”. the king exclaimed. “Is he going to rape the queen in my
own palace?”. The words were scarcely out of his mouth than a veil was thrown over Haman’s face.

Est 7:9 In the royal presence, Harbona, one of the officers, said, “There is that fifty-cubit gallows, too, which
Haman ran up for Mordecai, who spoke up to the king’s great advantage. It is all ready at his house”. “Hang him
on it”, said the king.

Est 7:10 So Haman was hanged on the gallows which he had erected for Mordecai, and the king’s wrath
subsided.

Est 8:1 That same day King Ahasuerus gave Queen Esther the house of Haman, the persecutor of the Jews.
Mordecai was presented to the king, Esther having revealed their mutual relationship.

Est 8:2 The king, who had recovered his signet ring from Haman, took it off and gave it to Mordecai, while
Esther gave Mordecai charge of Haman’s house.

Est 8:3 Esther again went to speak to the king. She fell at his feet, weeping and imploring his favour, to frustrate
the malice that Haman the Agagite had been plotting against the Jews.

Est 8:4 The king held out the golden sceptre to her, whereüpon Esther stood up and faced him.

Est 8:5 “If such is the king’s good pleasure”, she said, “and if I have found favour before him, if my petition seems
proper to him and if I myself am pleasing to his eyes, may he be pleased to issue a written revocation of the
letters which Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, has had written, ordering the destruction of the Jews
throughout the royal provinces.

Est 8:6 For how can I look on, while my people suffer what is proposed for them? How can I bear to witness the
extermination of my relatives?”.

Est 8:7 King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, “I for my part have given Esther



Haman’s house, and have had him hanged on the gallows for planning to destroy the Jews.

Est 8:8 You, for your part, write what you please as regards the Jews, in the king’s name, and seal it with the
king’s signet; for any edict written in the king’s name and sealed with his signet is irrevocable”.

Est 8:9 The royal scribes were summoned at once — it was the third month, the month of Sivan, on the twenty-
third day — and at Mordecai’s dictation an order was written to the Jews, the satraps, governors and principal
officials of the provinces stretching from India to Ethiopia, a hundred and twenty-seven provinces, to each
province in its own script, and to each people in its own language, and to the Jews in their own script and
language.

Est 8:10 These letters, written in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed with the king’s signet, were carried by
couriers mounted on horses from the king’s own stud-farms.

Est 8:1 1 In them the king granted the Jews, in whatever city they lived, the right to assemble in self-defence,
with permission to destroy, slaughter and annihilate any armed force of any people or province that might attack
them, together with their women and children, and to plunder their possessions,

Est 8:12 with effect from the same day throughout the provinces of King Ahasuerus — the thirteenth day of the
twelfth month, which is Adar. (a) The text of the letter was as follows: (b) “The Great King, Ahasuerus, to the
satraps of the hundred and twenty-seven provinces which stretch from India to Ethiopia, to the provincial
governors and to all our loyal subjects, greeting: (c) “Many people, repeatedly honoured by the extreme bounty
of their benefactors, only grow the more arrogant. It is not enough for them to seek our subjects’ injury, but
unable as they are to support the weight of their own surfeit they turn to scheming against their benefactors
themselves, (d) Not content with banishing gratitude from the human heart, but elated by the plaudits of people
unacquainted with goodness, notwithstanding that all is for ever under the eye of God, they expect to escape his
justice, so hostile to the wicked, (e) Thus it has often happened to those placed in authority that, having
entrusted friends with the conduct of affairs and allowed themselves to be influenced by them, they find
themselves sharing with these the guilt of innocent blood and involved in irremediable misfortunes, (f) the upright
intentions of rulers having been misled by false arguments of the evilly disposed, (g) This may be seen without
recourse to the history of earlier times to which we have referred; you have only to look at what is before you, at
the crimes perpetrated by a plague of unworthy officials, (h) For the future, we shall exert our efforts to assure
the tranquillity and peace of the realm for all, (i) by adopting new policies and by always judging matters that are
brought to our notice in the most equitable spirit, (k) “Thus Haman son of Hammedatha, a Macedonian, without a
drop of Persian blood and far removed from our goodness, enjoyed our hospitality (I) and was treated by us with
the benevolence which we show to every nation, even to the extent of being proclaimed our “father” and being
accorded universally the prostration of respect as second in dignity to the royal throne, (m) But he, unable to
keep within his own high rank, schemed to deprive us of our realm and of our life, (n) Furthermore, by tortuous
wiles and arguments, he would have had us destroy Mordecai, our saviour and constant benefactor, with Esther
the blameless partner of our majesty, and their whole nation besides, (o) He thought by these means to leave us
without support and so to transfer the Persian empire to the Macedonians, (p) “But we find that the Jews, marked
out for annihilation by this arch-scoundrel, are not criminals: they are in fact governed by the most just of laws.

(q) They are children of the Most High, the great and living God to whom we and our ancestors owe the
continuing prosperity of our realm, (r) You will therefore do well not to act on the letters sent by Haman son of
Hammedatha, since their author has been hanged at the gates of Susa with his whole household: a fitting
punishment, which God, Master of the Universe, has speedily inflicted on him. (s) Put up copies of this letter
everywhere, allow the Jews to observe their own customs without fear, and come to their help against anyone
who attacks them on the day originally chosen for their maltreatment, that is, the thirteenth day of the twelfth
month, which is Adar. (t) For the all-powerful God has made this day a day of joy and not of ruin for the chosen
people, (u) You, for your part, among your solemn festivals celebrate this as a special day with every kind of
feasting, so that now and in the future, for you and for Persians of good will, it may commemorate your rescue,
and for your enemies may stand as a reminder of their ruin, (v) “Every city and, more generally, every country,
which does not follow these instructions, will be mercilessly devastated with fire and sword, and made not only
inaccessible to human beings but hateful to wild animals and even birds for ever”.

Est 8:13 Copies of this edict, to be promulgated as law in each province, were published to the various peoples,
so that the Jews could be ready on the day stated to avenge themselves on their enemies.

Est 8:14 The couriers, mounted on the king’s horses, set out in great haste and urgency at the king’s command.
The edict was also published in the citadel of Susa.

Est 8:15 Mordecai left the royal presence in a princely gown of violet and white, with a great golden crown and a
cloak of fine linen and purple. The city of Susa shouted for joy.

Est 8:16 For the Jews there was light and gladness, joy and honour.

Est 8:17 In every province and in every city, wherever the king’s command and decree arrived, there was joy
and gladness among the Jews, with feasting and holiday-making. Of the country’s population many became
Jews, since now the Jews were feared.



Est 9:1 The king’s command and decree came into force on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, Adar, and
the day on which the enemies of the Jews had hoped to crush them produced the very opposite effect: the Jews
it was who crushed their enemies.

Est 9:2 In their towns throughout the provinces of King Ahasuerus, the Jews assembled to strike at those who
had planned to injure them. No one resisted them, since the various peoples were now all afraid of them.

Est 9:3 Provincial officers-of-state, satraps, governors and royal officials, all supported the Jews for fear of
Mordecai.

Est 9:4 And indeed Mordecai was a power in the palace and his fame was spreading through all the provinces;
Mordecai was steadily growing more powerful.

Est 9:5 So the Jews struck down all their enemies with the sword, with resulting slaughter and destruction, and
worked their will on their opponents.

Est 9:6 In the citadel of Susa alone, the Jews put to death and slaughtered five hundred men,

Est 9:7 notably Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,

Est 9:8 Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,

Est 9:9 Parmashtha, Arisai, Aridai and Jezatha,

Est 9:10 the ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the persecutor of the Jews. But they took no plunder.

Est 9:11 The number of those killed in the citadel of Susa was reported to the king that same day.

Est 9:12 The king said to Queen Esther, “In the citadel of Susa the Jews have killed five hundred men and also
the ten sons of Haman. What must they have done in the other provinces of the realm? Tell me your request; I
grant it to you. Tell me what else you would like; it is yours for the asking”.

Est 9:13 “If such is the king’s pleasure”, Esther replied, “let the Jews of Susa be allowed to enforce today’s
decree tomorrow as well. And as for the ten sons of Haman, let their bodies be hanged on the gallows”.

Est 9:14 Whereüpon, the king having given the order, the edict was promulgated in Susa and the ten sons of
Haman were hanged.

Est 9:15 Thus the Jews of Susa reassembled on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and killed three
hundred men in the city. But they took no plunder.

Est 9:16 The other Jews who lived in the king’s provinces also assembled to defend their lives and rid
themselves of their enemies. They slaughtered seventy-five thousand of their opponents. But they took no
plunder.

Est 9:17 This was on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. On the fourteenth day they rested and made it a
day of feasting and gladness.

Est 9:18 But for the Jews of Susa, who had assembled on the thirteenth and fourteenth days, the fifteenth was
the day they rested, making that a day of feasting and gladness.

Est 9:19 This is why Jewish country people, those who live in undefended villages, keep the fourteenth day of
the month of Adar as a day of gladness, feasting and holiday-making, and the exchanging of presents with one
another, (a) whereäs for those who live in cities the day of rejoicing and exchanging presents with their
neighbours is the fifteenth day of Adar.

Est 9:20 Mordecai committed these events to writing. Then he sent letters to all the Jews living in the provinces
of King Ahasuerus, both near and far,

Est 9:21 enjoining them to celebrate the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar every year,

Est 9:22 as the days on which the Jews had rid themselves of their enemies, and the month in which their
sorrow had been turned into gladness, and mourning into a holiday. He therefore told them to keep these as
days of festivity and gladness when they were to exchange presents and make gifts to the poor.

Est 9:23 Once having begun, the Jews continued observing these practices, Mordecai having written them an
account

Est 9:24 of how Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the persecutor of all the Jews, had plotted their
destruction and had cast the pur, that is, the lot, for their overthrow and ruin;

Est 9:25 but how, when he went back to the king to ask him to order the hanging of Mordecai, the wicked
scheme which he had devised against the Jews recoiled on his own head, and both he and his sons were
hanged on the gallows;

Est 9:26 and that, hence, these days were called Purim, from the word pur. And so, because of what was
written in this letter, and because of what they had seen for themselves and of what had happened to them,

Est 9:27 the Jews willingly bound themselves, their descendants and all who should join them, to celebrate
these two days without fail, in the manner prescribed and at the time appointed, year after year.

Est 9:28 Thus commemorated and celebrated from generation to generation, in every family, in every province,
in every city, these days of Purim will never be abrogated among the Jews, nor will their memory perish from
their race.

Est 9:29 Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, wrote with full authority to ratify this second letter,

Est 9:30 and sent letters to all the Jews of the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the realm of Ahasuerus,



in terms of peace and loyalty

Est 9:31 enjoining them to observe these days of Purim at the appointed time, as Mordecai the Jew had
recommended, and in the manner prescribed for themselves and their descendants, with additional ordinances
for fasts and lamentations.

Est 9:32 The ordinance of Esther fixed the law of Purim, which was then recorded in a book.

Est 1 0:1 King Ahasuerus put not only the mainland under tribute but the Mediterranean islands as well.

Est 1 0:2 All his feats of power and valour, and the account of the high honour to which he raised Mordecai: all
this is recorded in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Media and Persia.

Est 10:3 And Mordecai the Jew was next in rank to King Ahasuerus. He was a man held in respect among the
Jews, esteemed by thousands of his brothers, a man who sought the good of his people and cared for the
welfare of his entire race, (a) And Mordecai said, All this is God’s doing, (b) I remember the dream I had about
these matters, nothing of which has failed to come true: (c) the little spring that became a river, the light that
shone, the sun, the flood of water. Esther is the river — she whom the king married and made queen, (d) The two
dragons are Haman and myself, (e) The nations are those that banded together to blot out the name of Jew. (f)
The single nation, mine, is Israel, those who cried out to God and were saved. Yes, the Lord has saved his
people, the Lord has delivered us from all these evils, God has worked such signs and great wonders as have
never occurred among the nations, (g) Two destinies he appointed, one for his own people, one for the nations
at large, (h) And these two destinies were worked out at the hour and time and day laid down by God, involving
all the nations, (i) In this way God has remembered his people and vindicated his heritage; (k) and for them
these days, the fourteenth and fifteenth of the month of Adar, are to be days of assembly, of joy and of gladness
before God, through all generations and for ever among his people Israel”. (I) In the fourth year of the reign of
Ptolemy and Cleopatra, Dositheus, who affirmed that he was a priest and Levite, and Ptolemy his son brought
the foregoing letter concerning Purim. They vouched for its authenticity, the translation having been made by
Lysimachus son of Ptolemy, a member of the Jerusalem community.

1 Ma 1:1 Alexander of Macedon son of Philip had come from the land of Kittim and defeated Darius king of the
Persians and Medes, whom he succeeded as ruler, at first of Hellas.

1 Ma 1:2 He undertook many campaigns, gained possession of many fortresses, and put the local kings to
death.

IMa 1:3 So he advanced to the ends of the earth, plundering nation after nation; the earth grew silent before
him, and his ambitious heart swelled with pride.

IMa 1:4 He assembled very powerful forces and subdued provinces, nations and princes, and they became his
tributaries.

IMa 1:5 But the time came when Alexander took to his bed, in the knowledge that he was dying.

IMa 1:6 He summoned his officers, noblemen who had been brought up with him from his youth, and divided
his kingdom among them while he was still alive.

IMa 1:7 Alexander had reigned twelve years when he died.

IMa 1:8 Each of his officers established himself in his own region.

IMa 1:9 All assumed crowns after his death, they and their heirs after them for many years, bringing increasing
evils on the world.

IMa 1:10 From these there grew a wicked offshoot, Antiochus Epiphanes son of King Antiochus; once a
hostage in Rome, he became king in the 107th year of the kingdom of the Greeks.

1 Ma 1 :1 1 It was then that there emerged from Israel a set of renegades who led many people astray. “Come”,
they said, “let us ally ourselves with the gentiles surrounding us, for since we separated ourselves from them
many misfortunes have overtaken us”.

IMa 1:12 This proposal proved acceptable,

IMa 1:13 and a number of the people eagerly approached the king, who authorised them to practise the
gentiles’ observances.

1 Ma 1 :14 So they built a gymnasium in Jerusalem, such as the gentiles have,

IMa 1:15 disguised their circumcision, and abandoned the holy covenant, submitting to gentile rule as willing
slaves of impiety.

IMa 1:16 Once Antiochus had seen his authority established, he determined to make himself king of Egypt and
the ruler of both kingdoms.

IMa 1:17 He invaded Egypt in massive strength, with chariots and elephants (and cavalry) and a large fleet.

IMa 1:18 He engaged Ptolemy king of Egypt in battle, and Ptolemy turned back and fled before his advance,
leaving many casualties.

IMa 1:19 The fortified cities of Egypt were captured, and Antiochus plundered the country.

IMa 1:20 After his conquest of Egypt, in the year 143, Antiochus turned about and advanced on Israel and
Jerusalem in massive strength.

1 Ma 1 :21 Insolently breaking into the sanctuary, he removed the golden altar and the lamp-stand for the light



with all its fittings,

1 Ma 1 :22 together with the table for the loaves of permanent offering, the libation vessels, the cups, the golden
censers, the veil, the crowns, and the golden decoration on the front of the Temple, which he stripped of
everything.

1 Ma 1 :23 He made off with the silver and gold and precious vessels; he discovered the secret treasures and
seized them

IMa 1:24 and, removing all these, he went back to his own country, having shed much blood and uttered words
of extreme arrogance.

1 Ma 1 :25 There was deep mourning for Israel throughout the country:

IMa 1:26 Rulers and elders groaned; girls and young men wasted away; the women’s beauty suffered a
change;

IMa 1:27 every bridegroom took up a dirge, the bride sat grief-stricken on her marriage-bed.

1 Ma 1 :28 The earth quaked because of its inhabitants and the whole House of Jacob was clothed with shame.

1 Ma 1 :29 Two years later the king sent the Mysarch through the cities of Judah. He came to Jerusalem with an
impressive force,

IMa 1:30 and addressing them with what appeared to be peaceful words, he gained their confidence; then
suddenly he fell on the city, dealing it a terrible blow, and destroying many of the people of Israel.

1 Ma 1 :31 He pillaged the city and set it on fire, tore down its houses and encircling wall,

IMa 1:32 took the women and children captive and commandeered the cattle.

1 Ma 1 :33 They then rebuilt the City of David with a great strong wall and strong towers and made this their
Citadel.

1 Ma 1 :34 There they installed a brood of sinners, of renegades, who fortified themselves inside it,

IMa 1:35 storing arms and provisions, and depositing there the loot they had collected from Jerusalem; they
were to prove a great trouble.

1 Ma 1 :36 It became an ambush for the sanctuary, an evil adversary for Israel at all times.

IMa 1:37 They shed innocent blood all round the sanctuary and defiled the sanctuary itself.

IMa 1:38 The citizens of Jerusalem fled because of them, she became a dwelling-place of strangers; estranged
from her own offspring, her children forsook her.

1 Ma 1 :39 Her sanctuary became as forsaken as a desert, her feasts were turned into mourning, her Sabbaths
into a mockery, her honour into reproach.

1 Ma 1 :40 Her dishonour now fully matched her former glory, her greatness was turned into grief.

1 Ma 1 :41 The king then issued a proclamation to his whole kingdom that all were to become a single people,
each nation renouncing its particular customs.

IMa 1:42 All the gentiles conformed to the king’s decree,

IMa 1:43 and many Israelites chose to accept his religion, sacrificing to idols and profaning the Sabbath.

1 Ma 1 :44 The king also sent edicts by messenger to Jerusalem and the towns of Judah, directing them to adopt
customs foreign to the country,

IMa 1:45 banning burnt offerings, sacrifices and libations from the sanctuary, profaning Sabbaths and feasts,
IMa 1:46 defiling the sanctuary and everything holy,

IMa 1:47 building altars, shrines and temples for idols, sacrificing pigs and unclean beasts,

1 Ma 1 :48 leaving their sons uncircumcised, and prostituting themselves to all kinds of impurity and abomination,
1 Ma 1 :49 so that they should forget the Law and revoke all observance of it.

1 Ma 1 :50 Anyone not obeying the king’s command was to be put to death.

1 Ma 1 :51 Writing in such terms to every part of his kingdom, the king appointed inspectors for the whole people
and directed all the towns of Judah to offer sacrifice city by city.

1 Ma 1 :52 Many of the people — that is, every apostate from the Law — rallied to them and so committed evil in
the country,

IMa 1:53 forcing Israel into hiding in any possible place of refuge.

1 Ma 1 :54 On the fifteenth day of Chislev in the year 145 the king built the appalling abomination on top of the
altar of burnt offering; and altars were built in the surrounding towns of Judah
1 Ma 1 :55 and incense offered at the doors of houses and in the streets.

1 Ma 1 :56 Any books of the Law that came to light were torn up and burned.

1 Ma 1 :57 Whenever anyone was discovered possessing a copy of the covenant or practising the Law, the
king’s decree sentenced him to death.

1 Ma 1 :58 Month after month they took harsh action against any offenders they discovered in the towns of Israel.

1 Ma 1 :59 On the twenty-fifth day of each month, sacrifice was offered on the altar erected on top of the altar of

burnt offering.

IMa 1:60 Women who had had their children circumcised were put to death according to the edict
1 Ma 1 :61 with their babies hung round their necks, and the members of their household and those who had



performed the circumcision were executed with them.

IMa 1:62 Yet there were many in Israel who stood firm and found the courage to refuse unclean food.

1 Ma 1 :63 They chose death rather than contamination by such fare or profanation of the holy covenant, and
they were executed.

1 Ma 1 :64 It was a truly dreadful retribution that visited Israel.

1 Ma 2:1 About then, Mattathias son of John, son of Simeon, a priest of the line of Joarib, left Jerusalem and
settled in Modein.

IMa 2:2 He had five sons, John known as Gaddi,

IMa 2:3 Simon called Thassi,

IMa 2:4 Judas called Maccabaeus,

IMa 2:5 Eleazar, called Avaran, and Jonathan called Apphus.

IMa 2:6 When he saw the blasphemies being committed in Judah and Jerusalem,

1 Ma 2:7 he said, “Alas that I should have been born to witness the ruin of my people and the ruin of the Holy
City, and to sit by while she is delivered over to her enemies, and the sanctuary into the hand of foreigners.

1 Ma 2:8 “Her Temple has become like someöne of no repute,

1 Ma 2:9 the vessels that were her glory have been carried off as booty, her babies have been slaughtered in
her streets, her young men by the enemy’s sword.

IMa 2:10 Is there a nation that has not claimed a share of her royal prerogatives, that has not taken some of her
spoils?

1 Ma 2:1 1 All her ornaments have been snatched from her, her former freedom has become slavery.

IMa 2:12 See how the Holy Place, our beauty, our glory, is now laid waste, see how the gentiles have profaned
it!

IMa 2:13 What have we left to live for?”.

1 Ma 2:14 Mattathias and his sons tore their garments, put on sackcloth, and observed deep mourning.

IMa 2:15 The king’s commissioners who were enforcing the apostasy came to the town of Modein for the
sacrifices.

IMa 2:16 Many Israelites gathered round them, but Mattathias and his sons drew apart.

IMa 2:17 The king’s commissioners then addressed Mattathias as follows, “You are a respected leader, a great
man in this town; you have sons and brothers to support you.

IMa 2:18 Be the first to step forward and conform to the king’s decree, as all the nations have done, and the
leaders of Judah and the survivors in Jerusalem; you and your sons shall be reckoned among the Friends of the
King, you and your sons will be honoured with gold and silver and many presents”.

IMa 2:19 Raising his voice, Mattathias retorted, “Even if every nation living in the king’s dominions obeys him,
each forsaking its ancestral religion to conform to his decrees,

1 Ma 2:20 I, my sons and my brothers will still follow the covenant of our ancestors.

1 Ma 2:21 May Heaven preserve us from forsaking the Law and its observances.

1 Ma 2:22 As for the king’s orders, we will not follow them: we shall not swerve from our own religion either to
right or to left”.

1 Ma 2:23 As he finished speaking, a Jew came forward in the sight of all to offer sacrifice on the altar in Modein
as the royal edict required.

1 Ma 2:24 When Mattathias saw this, he was fired with zeal; stirred to the depth of his being, he gave vent to his
legitimate anger, threw himself on the man and slaughtered him on the altar.

1 Ma 2:25 At the same time he killed the king’s commissioner who was there to enforce the sacrifice, and tore
down the altar.

1 Ma 2:26 In his zeal for the Law he acted as Phinehas had against Zimri son of Salu.

1 Ma 2:27 Then Mattathias went through the town, shouting at the top of his voice, “Let everyone who has any
zeal for the Law and takes his stand on the covenant come out and follow me”.

IMa 2:28 Then he fled with his sons into the hills, leaving all their possessions behind in the town.

1 Ma 2:29 Many people who were concerned for virtue and justice went down to the desert and stayed there,

1 Ma 2:30 taking with them their sons, their wives and their cattle, so oppressive had their sufferings become.

1 Ma 2:31 Word was brought to the royal officials and forces stationed in Jerusalem, in the City of David, that
those who had repudiated the king’s edict had gone down to the hiding places in the desert.

1 Ma 2:32 A strong detachment went after them, and when it came up with them ranged itself against them in
battle formation, preparing to attack them on the Sabbath day,

1 Ma 2:33 and said, “Enough of this! Come out and do as the king orders and you will be spared”.

IMa 2:34 The others, however, replied, “We refuse to come out, and we will not obey the king’s orders and
profane the Sabbath day”.

1 Ma 2:35 The royal forces at once went into action,

1 Ma 2:36 but the others offered no opposition; not a stone was thrown, there was no barricading of the hiding



places.

1 Ma 2:37 They only said, “Let us all die innocent; let heaven and earth bear witness that you are massacring us
with no pretence of justice”.

1 Ma 2:38 The attack was pressed home on the Sabbath itself, and they were slaughtered, with their wives and
children and cattle, to the number of one thousand persons.

IMa 2:39 When the news reached Mattathias and his friends, they mourned them bitterly
1 Ma 2:40 and said to one another, “If we all do as our brothers have done, and refuse to fight the gentiles for our
lives and institutions, they will only destroy us the sooner from the earth”.

1 Ma 2:41 So then and there they came to this decision, “If anyone attacks us on the Sabbath day, whoëver he
may be, we shall resist him; we must not all be killed, as our brothers were in the hiding places”.

1 Ma 2:42 Soon they were joined by the Hasidaean party, stout fighting men of Israel, each one a volunteer on
the side of the Law.

IMa 2:43 All the refugees from the persecution rallied to them, giving them added support.

IMa 2:44 They organised themselves into an armed force, striking down the sinners in their anger, and the
renegades in their fury, and those who escaped them fled to the gentiles for safety.

IMa 2:45 Mattathias and his friends made a tour, overthrowing the altars

IMa 2:46 and forcibly circumcising all the boys they found uncircumcised in the territories of Israel.

IMa 2:47 They hunted down the upstarts and managed their campaign to good effect.

1 Ma 2:48 They wrested the Law out of the control of the gentiles and the kings and reduced the sinners to
impotence.

1 Ma 2:49 As the days of Mattathias were drawing to a close, he said to his sons, “Arrogance and outrage are
now in the ascendant; it is a period of turmoil and bitter hatred.

1 Ma 2:50 This is the time, my children, for you to have a burning zeal for the Law and to give your lives for the
covenant of our ancestors.

IMa 2:51 Remember the deeds performed by our ancestors, each in his generation, and you will win great
honour and everlasting renown.

1 Ma 2:52 Was not Abraham tested and found faithful, was that not considered as justifying him?

IMa 2:53 Joseph in the time of his distress maintained the Law, and so became lord of Egypt.

1 Ma 2:54 Phinehas, our father, in return for his burning zeal, received the covenant of everlasting priesthood.

1 Ma 2:55 Joshua, for carrying out his task, became judge of Israel.

IMa 2:56 Caleb, for his testimony before the assembled people, received an inheritance in the land.

1 Ma 2:57 David for his generous heart inherited the throne of an everlasting kingdom.

1 Ma 2:58 Elijah for his consuming fervour for the Law was caught up to heaven itself.

1 Ma 2:59 Hananiah, Azariah and Mishael, for their fidelity, were saved from the flame.

1 Ma 2:60 Daniel for his singleness of heart was rescued from the lion’s jaws.

1 Ma 2:61 Know then that, generation after generation, no one who hopes in him will be overcome.

1 Ma 2:62 Do not fear the threats of the sinner, all his brave show must come to the dunghill and the worms.

1 Ma 2:63 Exalted today, tomorrow he is nowhere to be found, for he has returned to the dust he came from and

his scheming is brought to nothing.

1 Ma 2:64 My children, be resolute and courageous for the Law, for it will bring you glory.

1 Ma 2:65 “Here is your brother Simeon, I know he is a man of sound judgement. Listen to him all your lives; let
him take your father’s place.

1 Ma 2:66 Judas Maccabaeus, strong and brave from his youth, let him be your general and conduct the war
against the gentiles.

1 Ma 2:67 The rest of you are to enrol in your ranks all those who keep the Law, and to assure the vengeance of
your people.

1 Ma 2:68 Pay back the gentiles to the full, and hold fast to the ordinance of the Law”.

1 Ma 2:69 Then he blessed them and was joined to his ancestors.

IMa 2:70 He died in the year 146 and was buried in his ancestral tomb at Modein, and all Israel mourned him
deeply.

IMa 3:1 His son, Judas, known as Maccabaeus, then took his place.

1 Ma 3:2 All his brothers, and all who had attached themselves to his father, supported him, and they fought for
Israel with a will.

IMa 3:3 He extended the fame of his people. Like a giant, he put on the breastplate and buckled on his war
harness; he engaged in battle after battle, protecting the ranks with his sword.

IMa 3:4 He was like a lion in his exploits, like a young lion roaring over its prey.

IMa 3:5 He pursued and tracked down the renegades, he consigned those who troubled his people to the
flames.

IMa 3:6 The renegades quailed with the terror he inspired, all evil-doers were utterly confounded, and



deliverance went forward under his leadership.

IMa 3:7 He brought bitterness to many a king and rejoicing to Jacob by his deeds, his memory is blessed for
ever and ever.

1 Ma 3:8 He went through the towns of Judah eliminating the irreligious from them, and diverted the Retribution
from Israel.

1 Ma 3:9 His name resounded to the ends of the earth, he rallied those who were on the point of perishing.

IMa 3:10 Next, Apollonius mustered the gentiles and a large force from Samaria to make war on Israel.

1 Ma 3:1 1 When Judas learned of it, he went out to meet him and routed and killed him. Many fell wounded, and
the survivors took to flight.

IMa 3:12 Their spoils were seized and the sword of Apollonius was taken by Judas, who used it to fight with
throughout his life.

IMa 3:13 On hearing that Judas had raised a mixed force of believers and seasoned fighters,

1 Ma 3:14 Seron, commander of the Syrian troops, said, “I shall make a name for myself and gain honour in the
kingdom if I fight Judas and those supporters of his who are so contemptuous of the king’s orders”.

IMa 3:15 He therefore launched another expedition, with a strong army of unbelievers to support him in taking
revenge on the Israelites.

IMa 3:16 He had nearly reached the descent of Beth-Horon when Judas went out to confront him with a handful
of men.

IMa 3:17 But as soon as these saw the force advancing to meet them, they said to Judas, “How can we, few as
we are, engage such overwhelming numbers? We are exhausted as it is, not having had anything to eat today”.
IMa 3:18 “It is easy”, Judas answered, “for a great number to be defeated by a few; indeed, in the sight of
Heaven, deliverance, whether by many or by few, is all one;

IMa 3:19 for victory in war does not depend on the size of the fighting force: Heaven accords the strength.

IMa 3:20 They are coming against us in full-blown insolence and lawlessness to destroy us, our wives and our
children, and to plunder us;

1 Ma 3:21 but we are fighting for our lives and our laws,

1 Ma 3:22 and he will crush them before our eyes; do not be afraid of them”.

1 Ma 3:23 When he had finished speaking, he made a sudden sally against Seron and his force and
overwhelmed them.

1 Ma 3:24 Judas pursued them down from Beth-Horon as far as the plain. About eight hundred of their men fell,
and the rest took refuge in the country of the Philistines.

IMa 3:25 Judas and his brothers began to be feared, and alarm seized the surrounding peoples.

IMa 3:26 His name even reached the king’s ears, and among the nations there was talk of Judas and his
battles.

1 Ma 3:27 The news of these events infuriated Antiochus, and he ordered mobilisation of all the forces in his
kingdom, a very powerful army.

IMa 3:28 Opening his treasury, he distributed a year’s pay to his troops, telling them to be prepared for any
eventuality.

1 Ma 3:29 He then found that the money in his coffers had run short and that the tribute of the province had
decreased, as a result of the dissension and disaster brought on the country by his own abrogation of laws that
had been in force from antiquity.

1 Ma 3:30 He began to fear that, as had happened more than once, he would not have enough to cover the
expenses and the lavish bounties he had previously been accustomed to make on a larger scale than his
predecessors on the throne.

1 Ma 3:31 In this grave quandary he resolved to invade Persia, there to levy tribute on the provinces and so
accumulate substantial funds.

IMa 3:32 He therefore left Lysias, a nobleman and member of the royal family, to manage the royal affairs
between the River Euphrates and the Egyptian frontier,

1 Ma 3:33 making him responsible for the education of his son Antiochus, until he should come back.

1 Ma 3:34 To him Antiochus made over half his forces, with the elephants, giving him instructions about what he
wanted done, particularly with regard to the inhabitants of Judaea and Jerusalem,

1 Ma 3:35 against whom he was to send a force, to crush and destroy the power of Israel and the remnant of
Jerusalem, to wipe out their very memory from the place,

1 Ma 3:36 to settle foreigners in all parts of their territory and to distribute their land into lots.

1 Ma 3:37 The king took the remaining half of his troops with him and set out from Antioch, the capital of his
kingdom, in the year 147; he crossed the River Euphrates and made his way through the Upper Provinces.

IMa 3:38 Lysias chose Ptolemy son of Dorymenes, with Nicanor and Gorgias, influential men from among the
Friends of the King,

IMa 3:39 and, under their command, despatched forty thousand foot and seven thousand horse to invade the



land of Judah and devastate it, as the king had ordered.

IMa 3:40 The entire force set out and reached the neighbourhood of Emmaus in the lowlands, where they
pitched camp.

1 Ma 3:41 The local merchants, hearing the news of this, arrived at the camp, bringing with them a large amount
of gold and silver, and fetters as well, proposing to buy the Israelites as slaves; they were accompanied by a
company from Idumaea and the Philistine country.

1 Ma 3:42 Judas and his brothers saw that the situation was going from bad to worse and that armies were
camping in their territory; they were also well aware that the king had ordered the people’s total destruction.

1 Ma 3:43 So they said to each other, “Let us restore the ruins of our people and fight for our people and our
sanctuary”.

1 Ma 3:44 The Assembly was summoned, to prepare for war, to offer prayer and to implore compassion and
mercy.

1 Ma 3:45 Jerusalem was as empty as a desert, none of her children to go in and out. The sanctuary was
trodden underfoot, men of an alien race held the Citadel, which had become a lodging for gentiles. There was no
more rejoicing for Jacob, the flute and lyre were mute.

1 Ma 3:46 After mustering, they made their way to Mizpah, opposite Jerusalem, since Mizpah was traditionally a
place of prayer for Israel.

1 Ma 3:47 That day they fasted and put on sackcloth, covering their heads with ashes and tearing their
garments.

1 Ma 3:48 For the guidance that the gentiles would have sought from the images of their false gods, they opened
the Book of the Law.

1 Ma 3:49 They also brought out the priestly vestments, with first-fruits and tithes, and marshalled the Nazirites
who had completed the period of their vow.

IMa 3:50 Then, raising their voices to Heaven, they cried, “What shall we do with these people, and where are
we to take them?

IMa 3:51 Your holy place has been trampled underfoot and defiled, your priests mourn in their humiliation,

1 Ma 3:52 and now the gentiles are in alliance to destroy us: you know what they have in mind for us.

1 Ma 3:53 How can we stand up and face them if you do not come to our aid?”.

IMa 3:54 Then they sounded the trumpets and raised a great shout.

1 Ma 3:55 Next, Judas appointed leaders for the people, to command a thousand, a hundred, fifty or ten men.

1 Ma 3:56 Those who were in the middle of building a house, or were about to be married, or were planting a
vineyard, or were afraid, he told to go home again, as the Law allowed.

1 Ma 3:57 The column then marched off and took up a position south of Emmaus.

IMa 3:58 “Stand to your arms”, Judas told them, “acquit yourselves bravely, in the morning be ready to fight
these gentiles massed against us to destroy us and our sanctuary.

1 Ma 3:59 Better for us to die in battle than to watch the ruin of our nation and our Holy Place.

IMa 3:60 Whatever be the will of Heaven, he will perform it”.

1 Ma 4:1 Gorgias took with him five thousand foot and a thousand picked cavalry, and the force moved off by
night

1 Ma 4:2 with the object of attacking the Jewish position and dealing them an unexpected blow; the men from
the Citadel were there to guide him.

1 Ma 4:3 Judas got wind of it and himself moved off with his fighters to strike at the royal army at Emmaus,

IMa 4:4 while its fighting troops were still dispersed outside the camp.

1 Ma 4:5 Hence, when Gorgias reached Judas’ camp, he found no one and began looking for the Jews in the
mountains. “For”, he said, “we have got them on the run”.

1 Ma 4:6 First light found Judas in the plain with three thousand men, although these lacked the armour and
swords they would have wished.

1 Ma 4:7 They could now see the gentile encampment with its strong fortifications and cavalry surrounding it,
clearly people who understood warfare.

1 Ma 4:8 Judas said to his men, “Do not be afraid of their numbers, and do not flinch at their attack.

IMa 4:9 Remember how our ancestors were delivered at the Red Sea when Pharaoh was pursuing them in
force.

IMa 4:10 And now let us call on Heaven: if he cares for us, he will remember his covenant with our ancestors
and will destroy this army confronting us today;

1 Ma 4:1 1 then all the nations will know for certain that there is One who ransoms and saves Israel”.

IMa 4:12 The foreigners looked up and, seeing the Jews advancing against them,

IMa 4:13 came out of the camp to join battle. Judas’ men sounded the trumpet

IMa 4:14 and engaged them. The gentiles were defeated and fled towards the plain

IMa 4:15 and all the stragglers fell by the sword. The pursuit continued as far as Gezer and the plains of



Idumaea, Azotus and Jamnia, and the enemy lost about three thousand men.

IMa 4:16 Breaking off the pursuit, Judas returned with his men

IMa 4:17 and said to the people, “Never mind the booty, for we have another battle ahead of us.

IMa 4:18 Gorgias and his troops are still near us in the mountains. First stand up to our enemies and fight them,
and then you can safely collect the booty”.

IMa 4:19 The words were hardly out of Judas’ mouth, when a detachment came into view, peering down from
the mountain.

1 Ma 4:20 Observing that their own troops had been routed and that the camp had been fired — since the smoke,
which they could see, attested the fact-

1 Ma 4:21 they were panic-stricken at the sight; and when, furthermore, they saw Judas’ troops drawn up for
battle on the plain,

IMa 4:22 they all fled into Philistine territory.

1 Ma 4:23 Judas then turned back to plunder the camp, and a large sum in gold and silver, with violet and sea-
purple stuffs, and many other valuables were carried off.

IMa 4:24 On their return, the Jews chanted praises to Fleaven, singing, “Fie is kind and his love is everlasting!”.

1 Ma 4:25 That day had seen a remarkable deliverance in Israel.

IMa 4:26 Those of the foreigners who had escaped came and gave Lysias an account of all that had happened.
IMa 4:27 The news shocked and dismayed him, for affairs in Israel had not gone as he intended, and the result
was quite the opposite to what the king had ordered.

IMa 4:28 The next year he mobilised sixty thousand picked troops and five thousand cavalry with the intention
of finishing off the Jews.

IMa 4:29 They advanced into Idumaea and made their base at Beth-Zur, where Judas met them with ten
thousand men.

IMa 4:30 When he saw their military strength he offered this prayer, “Blessed are you, Saviour of Israel, who
shattered the mighty warrior’s attack at the hand of your servant David, and delivered the Philistine camp into the
hands of Jonathan son of Saul, and his armour-bearer.

1 Ma 4:31 Crush this expedition in the same way at the hands of your people Israel; let their troops and cavalry
bring them nothing but shame.

IMa 4:32 Sow panic in their ranks, confound the confidence they put in their numbers and send them reeling in
defeat.

1 Ma 4:33 Overthrow them by the sword of those who love you, and all who acknowledge your name will sing
your praises”.

1 Ma 4:34 The two forces engaged, and five thousand men of Lysias’ troops fell in hand-to-hand fighting.

1 Ma 4:35 Seeing the rout of his army and the courage of Judas’ troops and their readiness to live or die nobly,
Lysias withdrew to Antioch, where he recruited mercenaries for a further invasion of Judaea in even greater
strength.

IMa 4:36 Judas and his brothers then said, “Now that our enemies have been defeated, let us go up to purify
the sanctuary and dedicate it”.

1 Ma 4:37 So they marshalled the whole army, and went up to Mount Zion.

1 Ma 4:38 There they found the sanctuary deserted, the altar desecrated, the gates burnt down, and vegetation
growing in the courts as it might in a wood or on some mountain, while the storerooms were in ruins.

IMa 4:39 They tore their garments and mourned bitterly, putting dust on their heads.

IMa 4:40 They prostrated themselves on the ground, and when the trumpets gave the signal they cried aloud to
Fleaven.

IMa 4:41 Judas then ordered his men to keep the Citadel garrison engaged until he had purified the sanctuary.

1 Ma 4:42 Next, he selected priests who were blameless and zealous for the Law
1 Ma 4:43 to purify the sanctuary and remove the stones of the “Pollution” to some unclean place.

1 Ma 4:44 They discussed what should be done about the altar of burnt offering which had been profaned,

1 Ma 4:45 and very properly decided to pull it down, rather than later be embarrassed about it since it had been
defiled by the gentiles. They therefore demolished it

1 Ma 4:46 and deposited the stones in a suitable place on the hill of the Dwelling to await the appearance of a
prophet who should give a ruling about them.

1 Ma 4:47 They took unhewn stones, as the Law prescribed, and built a new altar on the lines of the old one.

IMa 4:48 They restored the Holy Place and the interior of the Dwelling, and purified the courts.

1 Ma 4:49 They made new sacred vessels, and brought the lamp-stand, the altar of incense, and the table into
the Temple.

1 Ma 4:50 They burned incense on the altar and lit the lamps on the lamp-stand, and these shone inside the
Temple.

1 Ma 4:51 They placed the loaves on the table and hung the curtains and completed all the tasks they had



undertaken.

IMa 4:52 On the twenty-fifth of the ninth month, Chislev, in the year 148 they rose at dawn
1 Ma 4:53 and offered a lawful sacrifice on the new altar of burnt offering which they had made.

1 Ma 4:54 The altar was dedicated, to the sound of hymns, zithers, lyres and cymbals, at the same time of year
and on the same day on which the gentiles had originally profaned it.

IMa 4:55 The whole people fell prostrate in adoration and then praised Heaven who had granted them success.
1 Ma 4:56 For eight days they celebrated the dedication of the altar, joyfully offering burnt offerings, communion
and thanksgiving sacrifices.

IMa 4:57 They ornamented the front of the Temple with crowns and bosses of gold, renovated the gates and
storerooms, providing the latter with doors.

IMa 4:58 There was no end to the rejoicing among the people, since the disgrace inflicted by the gentiles had
been effaced.

1 Ma 4:59 Judas, with his brothers and the whole assembly of Israel, made it a law that the days of the
dedication of the altar should be celebrated yearly at the proper season, for eight days beginning on the twenty-
fifth of the month of Chislev, with rejoicing and gladness.

1 Ma 4:60 They then proceeded to build high walls with strong towers round Mount Zion, to prevent the gentiles
from coming and riding roughshod over it as in the past.

1 Ma 4:61 Judas stationed a garrison there to guard it; he also fortified Beth-Zur, so that the people would have
a fortress confronting Idumaea.

IMa 5:1 When the surrounding nations heard that the altar had been rebuilt and the sanctuary restored to what
it had been before, they became very angry

1 Ma 5:2 and decided to destroy the descendants of Jacob living among them; they began to murder and evict
our people.

IMa 5:3 Judas made war on the sons of Esau in Idumaea, in the region of Acrabattene where they were
besieging the Israelites. He dealt them a serious blow, drove them off and despoiled them.

1 Ma 5:4 He also remembered the wickedness of the sons of Baean, who were a menace and a trap for the
people with their ambushes on the roads.

1 Ma 5:5 Having blockaded them in their town and besieged them, he put them under the curse of destruction;
he then set fire to their towers and burned them down with everyone inside.

1 Ma 5:6 Next, he crossed over to the Ammonites where he found a strong fighting force and a numerous
people, commanded by Timotheus.

IMa 5:7 He fought many battles with them, defeated them and cut them to pieces.

1 Ma 5:8 Having captured Jazer and its dependent villages, he retired to Judaea.

1 Ma 5:9 Next, the gentiles of Gilead banded together to destroy the Israelites living in their territory. The latter,
however, took refuge in the fortress of Dathema,

IMa 5:10 and sent the following letter to Judas and his brothers: The gentiles round us have banded
themselves together against us to destroy us,

1 Ma 5:1 1 and they are preparing to storm the fortress in which we have taken refuge; Timotheus is in command
of their forces.

IMa 5:12 Come at once and rescue us from their clutches, for we have already suffered great losses.

IMa 5:13 All our countrymen living in Tobias’ country have been killed, their women and children have been
taken into captivity, their property has been seized, and about a thousand men have been destroyed there”.

1 Ma 5:14 While the letter was being read, other messengers arrived from Galilee with their garments torn,
bearing similar news,

IMa 5:15 “The people of Ptolemais, Tyre and Sidon have joined forces with the whole of gentile Galilee to
destroy us!”.

IMa 5:16 When Judas and the people heard this, they held a great assembly to decide what should be done for
their oppressed countrymen who were under attack from their enemies.

IMa 5:17 Judas said to his brother Simon, “Pick your men and go and relieve your countrymen in Galilee, while
my brother Jonathan and I make our way into Gilead”.

IMa 5:18 He left Joseph son of Zechariah and the people’s leader Azariah with the remainder of the army in
Judaea to keep guard, and gave them these orders,

IMa 5:19 “You are to be responsible for our people. Do not engage the gentiles until we return”.

1 Ma 5:20 Simon was allotted three thousand men for the expedition into Galilee, Judas eight thousand for
Gilead.

IMa 5:21 Simon advanced into Galilee, engaged the gentiles in several battles and swept all before him;

1 Ma 5:22 he pursued them to the gate of Ptolemais, and they lost about three thousand men, whose spoils he
collected.

1 Ma 5:23 With him, he took away the Jews of Galilee and Arbatta, with their wives and children and all their



possessions, and brought them into Judaea with great rejoicing.

IMa 5:24 Meanwhile Judas Maccabaeus and his brother Jonathan crossed the Jordan and made a three-days’
march through the desert,

IMa 5:25 where they encountered the Nabataeans, who gave them a friendly reception and told them
everything that had been happening to their brothers in Gilead,

IMa 5:26 many of whom, they said, were shut up in Bozrah and Bosor, Alema, Chaspho, Maked and Carnaim,
all large fortified towns.

1 Ma 5:27 Others were blockaded in the other towns of Gilead, and the enemy planned to attack and capture
these strongholds the very next day, and destroy all the people inside them on one day.

1 Ma 5:28 Judas and his army at once turned off by the desert road to Bozrah. He took the town and, having put
all the males to the sword and collected the booty, burned it down.

IMa 5:29 When night came, he left the place, and they continued their march until they reached the fortress.

1 Ma 5:30 In the light of dawn they looked, and there was an innumerable horde, setting up ladders and engines
to capture the fortress; the assault was just beginning.

1 Ma 5:31 When Judas saw that the attack had begun and that the war cry was rising to heaven from the city,
mingled with trumpet calls and a great clamour,

1 Ma 5:32 he said to the men of his army, “Into battle today for your brothers!”.

IMa 5:33 Dividing them into three commands, he advanced on the enemy’s rear, with trumpets sounding and
prayers shouted aloud.

IMa 5:34 The troops of Timotheus, recognising that this was Maccabaeus, fled before his advance;

Maccabaeus dealt them a crushing defeat; about eight thousand of their men fell that day.

IMa 5:35 Then, wheeling on Alema, he attacked and captured it and, having killed all the males and collected
the booty, burned the place down.

1 Ma 5:36 From there he moved on and took Chaspho, Maked, Bosor and the remaining towns of Gilead.

1 Ma 5:37 After these events, Timotheus mustered another force and pitched camp opposite Raphon, on the far
side of the stream-bed.

IMa 5:38 Judas sent men to reconnoitre the camp, and these reported back as follows, “With him are massed
all the gentiles surrounding us, making a very numerous army,

IMa 5:39 with Arab mercenaries as auxiliaries; they are encamped on the far side of the stream-bed, and ready
to launch an attack on you”. Judas then advanced to engage them,

1 Ma 5:40 and was approaching the watercourse with his troops when Timotheus told the commanders of his
army, “If he crosses first we shall not be able to resist him, because he will have a great advantage over us;

1 Ma 5:41 but if he is afraid and camps on the other side of the stream, we shall cross over to him and the
advantage will then be ours”.

IMa 5:42 As soon as Judas reached the watercourse, he posted people’s scribes along it, giving them this
order: “Do not let anyone pitch his tent; all are to go into battle!”.

1 Ma 5:43 He was himself the first across to the enemy side, with all the people following. He defeated all the
opposing gentiles, who threw down their arms and ran for refuge in the sanctuary of Carnaim.

IMa 5:44 The Jews first captured the town and then burned down the temple with everyone inside. And so
Carnaim was overthrown, and the enemy could offer no further resistance to Judas.

IMa 5:45 Next, Judas assembled all the Israelites living in Gilead, from the least to the greatest, with their
wives, children and belongings, an enormous muster, to take them to Judaea.

1 Ma 5:46 They reached Ephron, a large town straddling the road and strongly fortified. As it was impossible to
by-pass it either to right or to left, there was nothing for it but to march straight through.

IMa 5:47 But the people of the town denied them passage and barricaded the gates with stones.

1 Ma 5:48 Judas sent them a conciliatory message in these terms, “We want to pass through your territory to
reach our own; no one will do you any harm, we only want to go through on foot”. But they would not open up for
him.

1 Ma 5:49 So Judas sent an order down the column for everyone to halt where he stood.

IMa 5:50 The fighting men took up their positions; Judas attacked the town all day and night, and the town fell
to him.

1 Ma 5:51 He put all the males to the sword, razed the town to the ground, plundered it and marched through the town square over the bodies of the dead.

IMa 5:52 They then crossed the Jordan into the Great Plain, opposite Beth-Shean,

IMa 5:53 Judas all the time rallying the stragglers and encouraging the people the whole way until they reached
Judaea.

1 Ma 5:54 They climbed Mount Zion in joy and gladness and presented burnt offerings because they had
returned safe and sound without having lost a single man.

IMa 5:55 While Judas and Jonathan were in Gilead and Simon his brother in Galilee outside Ptolemais,



1 Ma 5:56 Joseph son of Zechariah, and Azariah, who were in command of the army, heard of their valiant
deeds and of the battles they had been fighting,

1 Ma 5:57 and said, “Let us make a name for ourselves too and go and fight the nations around us”.

1 Ma 5:58 So they issued orders to the men under their command and marched on Jamnia.

IMa 5:59 Gorgias and his men came out of the town and gave battle.

1 Ma 5:60 Joseph and Azariah were routed and pursued as far as the frontiers of Judaea. That day about two
thousand Israelites lost their lives.

1 Ma 5:61 Our people thus met with a great reverse, because they had not listened to Judas and his brothers,
thinking that they would do something equally valiant.

1 Ma 5:62 They were not, however, of the same breed of men as those to whom the deliverance of Israel was
entrusted.

IMa 5:63 The noble Judas and his brothers, however, were held in high honour throughout Israel and among all
the nations wherever their name was heard,

IMa 5:64 and people thronged round to acclaim them.

1 Ma 5:65 Judas marched out with his brothers to fight the Edomites in the country towards the south; he
stormed Hebron and its dependent villages, threw down its fortifications and burned down its encircling towers.
IMa 5:66 Leaving there, he made for the country of the Philistines and passed through Marisa.

1 Ma 5:67 Among the fallen in that day’s fighting were some priests who sought to prove their courage there by
joining in the battle, a foolhardy venture.

IMa 5:68 Judas next turned on Azotus, which belonged to the Philistines; he overthrew their altars, burned the
statues of their gods and, having pillaged their towns, withdrew to Judaea.

1 Ma 6:1 King Antiochus, meanwhile, was making his way through the Upper Provinces; he had heard that in
Persia there was a city called Elymais, renowned for its riches, its silver and gold,

IMa 6:2 and its very wealthy temple containing golden armour, breastplates and weapons, left there by
Alexander son of Philip, the king of Macedon, the first to reign over the Greeks.

1 Ma 6:3 He therefore went and attempted to take the city and pillage it, but without success, the citizens having
been forewarned.

1 Ma 6:4 They resisted him by force of arms. He was routed, and began retreating, very gloomily, towards
Babylon.

1 Ma 6:5 But, while he was still in Persia, news reached him that the armies which had invaded Judaea had
been routed,

1 Ma 6:6 and that Lysias in particular had advanced in massive strength, only to be forced to turn and flee before
the Jews; that the latter were now stronger than ever, thanks to the arms, supplies and abundant spoils acquired
from the armies they had cut to pieces,

1 Ma 6:7 and that they had pulled down the abomination which he had erected on the altar in Jerusalem, had
encircled the sanctuary with high walls as in the past, and had fortified Beth-Zur, one of his cities.

IMa 6:8 When the king heard this news he was amazed and profoundly shaken; he threw himself on his bed
and fell sick with grief, since things had not turned out for him as he had planned.

IMa 6:9 And there he remained for many days, subject to deep and recurrent fits of melancholy, until he
realised that he was dying.

IMa 6:10 Then, summoning all his Friends, he said to them, “Sleep evades my eyes, and my heart is cowed by
anxiety.

1 Ma 6:1 1 I have been wondering how I could have come to such a pitch of distress, so great a flood as that
which now engulfs me — 1 who was so generous and well-loved in my heyday.

IMa 6:12 But now I recall how wrongly I acted in Jerusalem when I seized all the vessels of silver and gold
there and ordered the extermination of the inhabitants of Judah for no reason at all.

IMa 6:13 This, I am convinced, is why these misfortunes have overtaken me, and why I am dying of melancholy
in a foreign land”.

1 Ma 6:14 He summoned Philip, one of his Friends, and made him regent of the whole kingdom.

IMa 6:15 He entrusted him with his diadem, his robe and his signet, on the understanding that he was to
educate his son Antiochus and train him for the throne.

IMa 6:16 King Antiochus then died, in the year 149.

IMa 6:17 Lysias, learning that the king was dead, established on the throne in succession to him his son
Antiochus, whom he had brought up from childhood — and styled him Eupator.

IMa 6:18 The people in the Citadel at the time were blockading Israel round the sanctuary and were taking
every opportunity to harm them and to support the gentiles.

IMa 6:19 Judas decided that they must be destroyed, and he mobilised the whole people to besiege them.

IMa 6:20 They assembled and laid siege to the Citadel in the year 150, building batteries and siege-engines.

1 Ma 6:21 But some of the besieged broke through the blockade, and to these a number of renegades from



Israel attached themselves.

1 Ma 6:22 They made their way to the king and said, “How much longer are you going to wait before you see
justice done and avenge our fellows?

1 Ma 6:23 We were content to serve your father, to comply with his orders, and to obey his edicts.

IMa 6:24 As a result our own people will have nothing to do with us; what is more, they have killed all those of
us they could catch, and looted our family property.

1 Ma 6:25 Nor is it on us alone that their blows have fallen, but on all your territories.

IMa 6:26 At this moment, they are laying siege to the Citadel of Jerusalem, to capture it, and they have fortified
the sanctuary and Beth-Zur.

1 Ma 6:27 Unless you forestall them at once, they will go on to even bigger things, and then you will never be
able to control them”.

IMa 6:28 The king was furious when he heard this and summoned all his Friends, the generals of his forces
and the marshals of horse.

IMa 6:29 He recruited mercenaries from other kingdoms and the Mediterranean islands.

IMa 6:30 His forces numbered a hundred thousand foot soldiers, twenty thousand cavalry and thirty-two
elephants with experience of battle conditions.

1 Ma 6:31 They advanced through Idumaea and besieged Beth-Zur, pressing the attack for days on end; they
also constructed siege-engines, but the defenders made a sortie and set these on fire, putting up a brave
resistance.

1 Ma 6:32 At this, Judas left the Citadel and pitched camp at Beth-Zechariah opposite the royal encampment.
IMa 6:33 The king rose at daybreak and marched his army at top speed down the road to Beth-Zechariah,
where his forces took up their battle formations and sounded the trumpets.

1 Ma 6:34 The elephants were given a syrup of grapes and mulberries to prepare them for the battle.

IMa 6:35 These animals were distributed among the phalanxes, to each elephant being allocated a thousand
men dressed in coats of mail with bronze helmets on their heads; five hundred picked horsemen were also
assigned to each beast.

1 Ma 6:36 The horsemen anticipated every move their elephant made; wherever it went they went with it, never
quitting it.

IMa 6:37 On each elephant, to protect it, was a stout wooden tower, kept in position by girths, each with its
three combatants, as well as its mahout.

1 Ma 6:38 The remainder of the cavalry was stationed on one or other of the two flanks of the army, to harass
the enemy and cover the phalanxes.

1 Ma 6:39 When the sun glinted on the bronze and golden shields, the mountains caught the glint and gleamed
like fiery torches.

1 Ma 6:40 One part of the royal army was deployed on the upper slopes of the mountain and the other in the
valley below; they advanced in solid, well-disciplined formation.

1 Ma 6:41 Everyone trembled at the noise made by this vast multitude, the thunder of the troops on the march
and the clanking of their armour, for it was an immense and mighty army.

IMa 6:42 Judas and his army advanced to give battle, and six hundred of the king’s army were killed.

IMa 6:43 Eleazar, called Avaran, noticing that one of the elephants was royally caparisoned and was also taller
than all the others, and supposing that the king was mounted on it,

IMa 6:44 sacrificed himself to save his people and win an imperishable name.

1 Ma 6:45 Boldly charging towards the creature through the thick of the phalanx, dealing death to right and left,
so that the enemy scattered on either side at his onslaught,

1 Ma 6:46 he darted in under the elephant, thrust at it from underneath, and killed it. The beast collapsed on top
of him, and he died on the spot.

IMa 6:47 The Jews however realising how strong the king was and how ferocious his army, retreated ahead of
them.

1 Ma 6:48 The royal army moved up to encounter them outside Jerusalem, and the king began to blockade
Judaea and Mount Zion.

1 Ma 6:49 He granted peace terms to the people of Beth-Zur, who evacuated the town; it lacked store of
provisions to withstand a siege, since the land was enjoying a sabbatical year.

IMa 6:50 Having occupied Beth-Zur, the king stationed a garrison there to hold it.

1 Ma 6:51 He besieged the sanctuary for a long time, erecting batteries and siege-engines, flame-throwers and
ballistas, scorpions to discharge arrows, and catapults.

1 Ma 6:52 The defenders countered these by constructing their own engines and were thus able to prolong their
resistance.

1 Ma 6:53 But they had no food in their stores since it was the seventh year, and because those who had taken
refuge in Judaea from the gentiles had eaten up the last of their reserves.



1 Ma 6:54 Only a few men were left in the Holy Place, owing to the severity of the famine; the rest had dispersed
and gone home.

IMa 6:55 Meanwhile Philip, whom King Antiochus before his death had appointed to train his son Antiochus for
the throne,

IMa 6:56 had returned from Persia and Media with the forces that had accompanied the king, and was planning
to seize control of affairs.

1 Ma 6:57 On hearing this, Lysias at once decided to leave, and said to the king, the generals of the army and
the men, “We are growing weaker every day, we are short of food, and the place we are besieging is well
fortified; moreover the affairs of the kingdom demand our attention.

1 Ma 6:58 Let us offer the hand of friendship to these men and make peace with them and with their whole
nation.

1 Ma 6:59 Let us grant them permission to follow their own customs as before, since it is our abolition of these
customs that has provoked them into acting like this”.

IMa 6:60 The king and his commanders approved this argument, and he offered the Jews peace terms, which
they accepted.

1 Ma 6:61 The king and the generals ratified the treaty by oath, and the besieged accordingly left the fortress.
IMa 6:62 The king then entered Mount Zion, but on seeing how impregnable the place was, he broke the oath
he had sworn and gave orders for the encircling wall to be demolished.

1 Ma 6:63 He then hurriedly withdrew, making off for Antioch, where he found Philip already master of the city.
Antiochus gave battle and captured the city by force of arms.

IMa 7:1 In the year 151 , Demetrius son of Seleucus left Rome and arrived with a few men at a town on the
coast, where he inaugurated his reign.

IMa 7:2 It so happened that, as he was entering the royal residence of his ancestors, the army captured
Antiochus and Lysias, and intended to bring them to him.

1 Ma 7:3 On hearing this, he said, “Keep them out of my sight”.

1 Ma 7:4 The army put them to death, and Demetrius ascended his throne.

IMa 7:5 Next, all those Israelites without law or piety, led by Alcimus, whose ambition was to become high
priest,

IMa 7:6 approached the king and denounced our people to him. “Judas and his brothers”, they said, “have killed
all your friends, and he has driven us out of our country.

1 Ma 7:7 Send someöne now whom you can trust; let him go and see the wholesale ruin Judas has brought on
us and on the king’s dominions, and let him punish the wretches and all who assist them”.

IMa 7:8 The king chose Bacchides, one of the Friends of the King, governor of Transeuphrates, an important
personage in the kingdom and loyal to the king.

IMa 7:9 He sent him with the godless Alcimus, whom he confirmed in the high priesthood, with orders to exact
retribution from the Israelites.

IMa 7:10 So they set out with a large force and, on reaching Judaea, sent emissaries to Judas and his brothers
with proposals peaceable yet treacherous.

1 Ma 7:1 1 The latter, however, did not put any faith in their words, aware that they had come with a large force.
IMa 7:12 Nevertheless, a commission of scribes presented themselves before Alcimus and Bacchides, to sue
for just terms.

IMa 7:13 The first among the Israelites to ask them for peace terms were the Hasidaeans,

IMa 7:14 who reasoned thus, “This is a priest of Aaron’s line who has come with the armed forces; he will not
wrong us”.

IMa 7:15 He did in fact discuss peace terms with them and gave them his oath, “We shall not attempt to injure
you or your friends”.

IMa 7:16 They believed him, but he arrested sixty of them and put them to death on one day, fulfilling the words
of scripture:

IMa 7:17 They have scattered the bodies of your faithful, and shed their blood all round Jerusalem, leaving no
one to bury them!

IMa 7:18 At this, fear and dread gripped the whole people. “There is no truth or virtue in them”, they said, “they
have broken their agreement and their sworn oath”.

IMa 7:19 Bacchides then left Jerusalem and encamped at Beth-Zeth, and from there sent and arrested many of
the men who had deserted him and a few of our people too; he had them killed and thrown down the great well.

1 Ma 7:20 He then put Alcimus in charge of the province, leaving an army with him to support him; Bacchides
himself returned to the king.

IMa 7:21 Alcimus continued his struggle to become high priest,

IMa 7:22 and all who were disturbing the peace of their own people rallied to him, and, having won control of
Judaea, did much harm in Israel.



1 Ma 7:23 Seeing that all the wrongs done to the Israelites by Alcimus and his supporters exceeded what the
gentiles had done,

1 Ma 7:24 Judas went right round the whole territory of Judaea to take vengeance on those who had deserted
him and to prevent their free movement about the country.

IMa 7:25 When Alcimus saw how strong Judas and his supporters had grown and realised that he was
powerless to resist them, he went back to the king, to whom he made malicious accusations against them.

1 Ma 7:26 The king sent Nicanor, one of his generals ranking as Illustrious and a bitter enemy of Israel, with
orders to exterminate the people.

IMa 7:27 Reaching Jerusalem with a large force, Nicanor sent a friendly, yet treacherous, message to Judas
and his brothers, as follows:

IMa 7:28 “Let us have no fighting between you and me; I shall come with a small escort for a peaceful meeting
with you”.

IMa 7:29 He met Judas and they exchanged friendly greetings; the enemy, however, had made preparations to
abduct Judas.

IMa 7:30 When Judas became aware of Nicanor’s treacherous purpose in coming to see him, he took fright and
refused any further meeting.

1 Ma 7:31 Nicanor then realised that his plan had been discovered, and took the field against Judas, to give
battle near Caphar-Salama.

1 Ma 7:32 About five hundred of Nicanor’s men fell; the rest took refuge in the City of David.

1 Ma 7:33 After these events Nicanor went up to Mount Zion. Some of the priests came out of the Holy Place
with some elders, to give him a friendly welcome and show him the burnt offering being presented for the king.
IMa 7:34 But he ridiculed them, laughed at them, defiled them and used insolent language, swearing in his
rage,

1 Ma 7:35 “Unless Judas is handed over to me this time with his army, as soon as I am safely back, I promise
you, I shall burn this building down!”.

1 Ma 7:36 Then he went off in a fury. At this, the priests went in again, and stood weeping in front of the altar
and the Temple, saying,

1 Ma 7:37 “You have chosen this house to be called by your name, to be a house of prayer and petition for your
people.

1 Ma 7:38 Take vengeance on this man and on his army, and let them fall by the sword; remember their
blasphemies and give them no respite”.

1 Ma 7:39 Nicanor left Jerusalem and encamped at Beth-Horon, where he was joined by an army from Syria.
IMa 7:40 Judas, meanwhile, camped at Adasa with three thousand men, and offered this prayer,

1 Ma 7:41 “When the king’s envoys blasphemed, your angel went out and struck down one hundred and eighty-
five thousand of his men.

1 Ma 7:42 In the same way let us see you crush this army today, so that everyone else may know that this man
has spoken blasphemously against your sanctuary: pass judgement on him as his wickedness deserves!”.

IMa 7:43 The armies met in battle on the thirteenth of the month Adar, and Nicanor’s army was crushed, he
himself being the first to fall in the battle.

1 Ma 7:44 When Nicanor’s soldiers saw him fall, they threw down their arms and fled.

1 Ma 7:45 The Jews pursued them a day’s journey, from Adasa to the approaches of Gezer; they sounded their
trumpets in warning as they followed them,

1 Ma 7:46 and people came out of all the surrounding Judaean villages to encircle the fugitives, who then turned
back on their own men. All fell by the sword, not one being left alive.

IMa 7:47 Having collected the spoils and booty, they cut off Nicanor’s head and the right hand he had stretched
out in a display of insolence; these were taken and displayed within sight of Jerusalem.

1 Ma 7:48 The people were overjoyed and kept that day as a great holiday:

IMa 7:49 indeed they decided to celebrate it annually on the thirteenth of Adar.

1 Ma 7:50 For a short while Judaea enjoyed peace.

1 Ma 8:1 Now Judas had heard of the reputation of the Romans: how strong they were, and how well disposed
towards any who made common cause with them, making a treaty of friendship with anyone who approached
them.

1 Ma 8:2 (And, indeed, they were extremely powerful.) He had been told of their wars and of their prowess
among the Gauls, whom they had conquered and put under tribute;

1 Ma 8:3 and of all they had done in the province of Spain to gain possession of the silver and gold mines there,
IMa 8:4 making themselves masters of the whole country by their determination and perseverance, despite its
great distance from their own; of the kings who came from the ends of the earth to attack them, only to be
crushed by them and overwhelmed with disaster, and of others who paid them annual tribute;

1 Ma 8:5 Philip, Perseus king of the Kittim, and others who had dared to make war on them, had been defeated



and reduced to subjection,

IMa 8:6 while Antiochus the Great, king of Asia, who had advanced to attack them with a hundred and twenty
elephants, cavalry, chariots and a very large army, had also suffered defeat at their hands;

IMa 8:7 they had taken him alive and imposed on him and his successors, on agreed terms, the payment of an
enormous tribute, the surrender of hostages, and the cession

1 Ma 8:8 of the Indian territory, with Media, Lydia, and some of their best provinces, which they took from him
and gave to King Eumenes.

IMa 8:9 Judas had also heard how, when the Greeks planned an expedition to destroy the Romans,

IMa 8:10 the latter had got wind of it and, sending a single general against them, had fought a campaign in
which they inflicted heavy casualties, carried their women and children away into captivity, pillaged their goods,
subdued their country, tore down their fortresses and reduced them to a slavery lasting to the present day;

1 Ma 8:1 1 and how they had destroyed and subjugated all the other kingdoms and islands that resisted them.
IMa 8:12 But where their friends and those who relied on them were concerned, they had always stood by their
friendship. They had subdued kings far and near, and all who heard their name went in terror of them.

IMa 8:13 One man, if they determined to help him and advance him to a throne, would certainly occupy it, while
another, if they so determined, would find himself deposed; their influence was paramount.

1 Ma 8:14 In spite of all this, no single one of them had assumed a crown or put on the purple for his own
aggrandisement.

IMa 8:15 They had set up a senate, where three hundred and twenty councillors deliberated daily, constantly
debating how best to regulate public affairs.

IMa 8:16 They entrusted their government to one man for a year at a time, with absolute power over their whole
empire, and this man was obeyed by all without envy or jealousy.

IMa 8:17 Having chosen Eupolemus son of John, of the family of Accos, and Jason son of Eleazar, Judas sent
them to Rome to make a treaty of friendship and alliance with these people,

IMa 8:18 in the hope of being rid of the yoke, for they could see that Greek rule was reducing Israel to slavery.
IMa 8:19 The envoys made the lengthy journey to Rome and presented themselves before the Senate with
their formal proposal:

IMa 8:20 “Judas Maccabaeus and his brothers, with the Jewish people, have sent us to you to conclude a treaty
of alliance and peace with you, and to enrol ourselves as your allies and friends”.

1 Ma 8:21 The proposal met with the approval of the senators.

1 Ma 8:22 Here is a copy of the rescript which they engraved on bronze tablets and sent to Jerusalem to be kept
there by the Jews as a record of peace and alliance:

IMa 8:23 “Good fortune attend the Romans and the Jewish nation by sea and land for ever; may sword or
enemy be far from them!

1 Ma 8:24 “If war comes first to Rome or any of her allies throughout her dominions,

1 Ma 8:25 the Jewish nation will take action as her ally, as occasion may require, and do it wholeheartedly.

1 Ma 8:26 They will not give or supply to the enemy any grain, arms, money or ships: thus has Rome decided,
and they are to honour their obligations without guarantees.

1 Ma 8:27 In the same way, if war comes first to the Jewish nation, the Romans will support them energetically
as occasion may offer,

1 Ma 8:28 and the aggressor will not be furnished with grain, arms, money or ships: such is the Roman decision,
and they will honour these obligations without treachery.

1 Ma 8:29 Such are the articles under which the Romans have concluded their treaty with the Jewish people.

1 Ma 8:30 If, later, either party should decide to make any addition or deletion, they will be free to do so, and any
such addition or deletion will be binding.

1 Ma 8:31 “As regards the wrongs done to them by King Demetrius, we have written to him in these terms: Why
have you made your yoke lie heavy on our friends and allies the Jews?

1 Ma 8:32 If they appeal against you again, we shall uphold their rights and make war on you by sea and land”.

1 Ma 9:1 Demetrius, hearing that Nicanor and his army had fallen in battle, sent Bacchides and Alcimus a
second time into Judaea, and with them the right wing of his army.

IMa 9:2 They took the road to Galilee and besieged Mesaloth in Arbela, and captured it, putting many people to
death.

IMa 9:3 In the first month of the year 152, they encamped outside Jerusalem;

1 Ma 9:4 they then moved on, making their way to Beer-Zaith with twenty thousand foot and two thousand horse.
IMa 9:5 Judas lay in camp at Elasa, with three thousand picked men.

1 Ma 9:6 When they saw the huge size of the enemy forces they were terrified, and many slipped out of the
camp, until no more than eight hundred of the force were left.

IMa 9:7 With battle now inevitable, Judas realised that his army had melted away; he was aghast, for he had no
time to rally them.



1 Ma 9:8 Yet, dismayed as he was, he said to those who were left, “Up! Let us face the enemy; we may yet have
the strength to fight them”.

1 Ma 9:9 His men tried to dissuade him, declaring, “We have no strength for anything but to escape with our lives
this time; then we can come back with our brothers to fight them; by ourselves we are too few”.

IMa 9:10 Judas retorted, “That I should do such a thing as run away from them! If our time has come, at least
let us die like men for our countrymen, and leave nothing to tarnish our reputation”.

1 Ma 9:1 1 The army marched out of camp and drew up, facing the enemy. The cavalry was drawn up in two
squadrons; the slingers and archers marched in the van of the army, and all the best fighters were put in the
front rank;

IMa 9:12 Bacchides was on the right wing. The phalanx advanced from between the two squadrons, sounding
the trumpets; the men on Judas’ side also blew their trumpets,

IMa 9:13 and the earth shook with the noise of the armies. The engagement lasted from morning until evening.
IMa 9:14 Judas saw that Bacchides and the main strength of his army lay on the right; all the stout-hearted
rallied to him,

IMa 9:15 and they crushed the right wing, pursuing them as far as the Azara Hills.

IMa 9:16 But when the Syrians on the left wing saw that the right had been broken, they turned and followed
hot on the heels of Judas and his men to take them in the rear.

IMa 9:17 The fight became desperate, and there were many casualties on both sides.

IMa 9:18 Judas himself fell, and the remnant fled.

IMa 9:19 Jonathan and Simon took up their brother Judas and buried him in his ancestral tomb at Modein.

IMa 9:20 All Israel wept and mourned him deeply and for many days they repeated this dirge.

1 Ma 9:21 “What a downfall for the strong man, the man who kept Israel safe!”.

1 Ma 9:22 The other deeds of Judas, the battles he fought, the exploits he performed, and all his titles to
greatness have not been recorded; but they were very many.

1 Ma 9:23 After the death of Judas, the renegades came out of hiding throughout Israel and all the evil-doers
reappeared.

1 Ma 9:24 At that time there was a severe famine, and the country went over to their side.

1 Ma 9:25 Bacchides deliberately chose the enemies of religion to administer the country.

1 Ma 9:26 These traced and searched out the friends of Judas and brought them before Bacchides, who ill-
treated and mocked them.

1 Ma 9:27 A terrible oppression began in Israel; there had been nothing like it since the disappearance of
prophecy among them.

IMa 9:28 The friends of Judas then all united in saying to Jonathan,

1 Ma 9:29 “Since your brother Judas died, there has been no one like him to head the resistance against our
enemies, people like Bacchides and others who hate our nation.

1 Ma 9:30 Accordingly, we have today chosen you to take his place as our ruler and leader and to fight our
campaigns”.

1 Ma 9:31 Whereüpon, Jonathan took command, in succession to his brother Judas.

IMa 9:32 Bacchides, when he heard the news, made plans to kill Jonathan.

1 Ma 9:33 But this became known to Jonathan, his brother Simon and all his supporters, and they took refuge in
the desert of Tekoa, camping by the water-supply at Asphar storage-well.

1 Ma 9:34 (Bacchides came to know of this on the Sabbath day, and he too crossed the Jordan with his entire
army.)

IMa 9:35 Jonathan sent his brother, who was one of his commanders, to ask his friends the Nabataeans to
store their considerable baggage for them.

IMa 9:36 The sons of Amrai, however, those of Medeba, intercepted them, captured John and everything he
had and made off with their prize.

1 Ma 9:37 Later, Jonathan and his brother Simon were told that the sons of Amrai were celebrating an important
wedding, and were escorting the bride, a daughter of one of the great notables of Canaan, from Nabata with a
large retinue.

1 Ma 9:38 Remembering the bloody end of their brother John, they went up and hid under cover of the mountain.
1 Ma 9:39 As they were keeping watch, a noisy procession came into sight with a great deal of baggage, and the
bridegroom, with his groomsmen and his family, came out to meet it with tambourines and a band, and rich,
warlike display.

IMa 9:40 The Jews rushed down on them from their ambush and killed them, inflicting heavy casualties; the
survivors escaped to the mountain, leaving their entire baggage train to be captured.

1 Ma 9:41 Thus, the wedding was turned into mourning and the music of their band into lamentation.

1 Ma 9:42 Having in this way avenged in full the blood of their brother, they returned to the marshes of the
Jordan.



IMa 9:43 As soon as Bacchides heard this, he came on the Sabbath day with a considerable force to the steep
banks of the Jordan.

1 Ma 9:44 Jonathan said to his men, “Up! Let us fight for our lives, for today it is not as in the old days.

1 Ma 9:45 You can see, we shall have to fight on our front and to our rear; we have the waters of the Jordan on
one side, the marsh and scrub on the other, and we have no line of withdrawal.

1 Ma 9:46 This is the moment to call on Heaven, to deliver you from the clutches of your enemies”.

IMa 9:47 The engagement was begun by Jonathan, who aimed a blow at Bacchides, but the Syrian disengaged
himself and withdrew,

IMa 9:48 whereüpon Jonathan and his men leapt into the Jordan and swam to the other bank; the enemy did
not, however, cross the Jordan in pursuit.

1 Ma 9:49 That day, Bacchides lost about a thousand men.

1 Ma 9:50 Bacchides went back to Jerusalem and began fortifying some of the Judaean towns: the fortresses of
Jericho, Emmaus, Beth-Horon, Bethel, Timnath, Pharathon and Tephon, with high walls and barred gates,

1 Ma 9:51 and stationed a garrison in each of them to harass Israel.

1 Ma 9:52 He also fortified the town of Beth-Zur, Gezer and the Citadel, and placed troops in them with supplies
of provisions.

1 Ma 9:53 He took the sons of the leading men of the country as hostages, and had them placed under guard in
the Citadel of Jerusalem.

1 Ma 9:54 In the year 1 53, in the second month, Alcimus ordered the demolition of the wall of the inner court of
the sanctuary, destroying the work of the prophets. Alcimus had just begun the demolition
IMa 9:55 when he suffered a stroke, and his work was interrupted. His mouth became obstructed, and his
paralysis made him incapable of speaking at all or giving directions to his household;

1 Ma 9:56 it was not long before he died in great agony.

1 Ma 9:57 On the death of Alcimus, Bacchides went back to the king, and Judaea was left in peace for two
years.

IMa 9:58 The renegades then all agreed on a plan. “Now is the time”, they said, “while Jonathan and his
supporters are living in peace and are full of confidence, for us to bring back Bacchides, and he will arrest the lot
of them in one night”.

1 Ma 9:59 So they went to him and reached an understanding.

1 Ma 9:60 Bacchides at once set out with a large force, and sent secret instructions to all his allies in Judaea to
seize Jonathan and his supporters. But they were unable to do this because their plan became known,

1 Ma 9:61 and Jonathan and his men arrested some fifty of the men of the country who were ringleaders in the
plot, and put them to death.

1 Ma 9:62 Jonathan and Simon then retired with their partisans to Beth-Bassi in the desert; they rebuilt the
ruinous parts of the place and fortified it.

IMa 9:63 When Bacchides heard this, he mustered his whole force and notified his adherents in Judaea.

IMa 9:64 He then proceeded to lay siege to Beth-Bassi, the fighting was protracted, and he constructed siege-
engines.

IMa 9:65 Jonathan, however, leaving his brother Simon in the town, broke out into the countryside with a
handful of men.

1 Ma 9:66 He launched a blow at Odomera and his brothers, and at the sons of Phasiron in their encampment;
whereüpon, these too came into the struggle, joining forces with him.

1 Ma 9:67 Simon and his people, meanwhile, made a sortie from the town and set fire to the siege-engines.

IMa 9:68 Taking the offensive against Bacchides, they defeated him. He was greatly disconcerted to find that
his plan and his assault had come to nothing,

1 Ma 9:69 and vented his anger on those renegades who had induced him to enter the country, putting many of
them to death; he then decided to take his own troops home.

1 Ma 9:70 Discovering this, Jonathan sent envoys to negotiate peace terms and the release of prisoners with
him.

1 Ma 9:71 Bacchides agreed to this, accepting his proposals and swearing never to seek occasion to harm him
for the rest of his life.

1 Ma 9:72 Having surrendered to Jonathan those prisoners he had earlier taken in Judaea, he turned about and
withdrew to his own country, and never again came near their frontiers.

IMa 9:73 The sword no longer hung over Israel, and Jonathan settled in Michmash, where he began to judge
the people and to rid Israel of the godless.

IMa 10:1 In the year 160, Alexander, son of Antiochus Epiphanes, raised an army and occupied Ptolemais. He
was well received, and there inaugurated his reign.

IMa 10:2 On hearing this, King Demetrius assembled a very large army and marched off to do battle with him.
IMa 10:3 Demetrius furthermore sent Jonathan a most conciliatory letter, promising to promote him in rank,



IMa 10:4 for, as he said, “We had better move first to come to terms with these people before he makes
common cause with Alexander against us;

IMa 10:5 he will not have forgotten all the wrongs we inflicted on him and his brothers, and on his nation”.

IMa 10:6 He even authorised him to raise an army, to manufacture arms, and to describe himself as his ally,
and ordered the hostages in the Citadel to be surrendered to him.

1 Ma 1 0:7 Jonathan went straight to Jerusalem and read the letter in the hearing of the whole people and of the
men in the Citadel.

IMa 10:8 They were terrified when they heard that the king had given him authority to raise an army.

IMa 10:9 The men in the Citadel surrendered the hostages to Jonathan, who handed them back to their
parents.

IMa 10:10 Jonathan then took up residence in Jerusalem and began the rebuilding and restoration of the city.
IMa 10:1 1 He ordered those responsible for the work to build the walls and the defences round Mount Zion of
squared stone blocks to make them stronger, and this was done.

IMa 10:12 The foreigners in the fortresses built by Bacchides abandoned them,

IMa 10:13 one after another leaving his post to go back to his own country.

IMa 10:14 Only at Beth-Zur were a few left of those who had forsaken the Law and the precepts, since this was
their refuge.

IMa 10:15 King Alexander heard of all the promises Demetrius had sent to Jonathan, and he was also given an
account of the battles and exploits of this man and his brothers and of the hardships they had endured.

IMa 10:16 “Shall we ever find another man like him?”. he exclaimed. “We must make him our friend and ally!”.

IMa 10:17 He therefore wrote him a letter, addressing him in these terms:

IMa 10:18 “King Alexander to his brother Jonathan, greetings.

IMa 10:19 “You have been brought to our notice as a strong man of action and as someöne who deserves to be
our friend.

1 Ma 1 0:20 Accordingly, we have today appointed you high priest of your nation, with the title of ‘Friend of the
King’” — he also sent him a purple robe and a golden crown-'and you are to study our interests and maintain
friendly relations with us”.

IMa 10:21 Jonathan put on the sacred vestments in the seventh month of the year 160, on the feast of Shelters;
he then set about raising troops and manufacturing arms in quantity.

IMa 10:22 Demetrius was displeased when he heard what had happened.

1 Ma 1 0:23 “What have we been doing”, he said, “for Alexander to forestall us in winning the friendship of the
Jews and so improving his own position?

IMa 10:24 I too shall address an appeal to them, offering them advancement and riches as an inducement to
support me”.

IMa 10:25 And he wrote to them as follows: “King Demetrius to the Jewish nation, greetings.

1 Ma 1 0:26 “We have heard how you have kept your agreement with us and have maintained friendly relations
with us and have not gone over to our enemies, and it has given us great satisfaction.

1 Ma 1 0:27 If you now continue to keep faith with us, we shall make you a handsome return for what you do on
our behalf.

1 Ma 1 0:28 We shall accord you many exemptions and grant you privileges.

IMa 10:29 “Henceforth I release you and exempt all the Jews from the tribute, the salt dues and the crown
levies,

1 Ma 1 0:30 and whereäs I am entitled to one-third of the grain and one-half of the fruit of the trees, I release from
this levy, from today and for the future, Judaea and the three districts annexed to it from Samaria-Galilee, from
this day henceforth in perpetuity.

IMa 10:31 Jerusalem will be sacred and exempt, with its territory, from tithes and dues.

1 Ma 1 0:32 I relinquish control of the Citadel in Jerusalem and make it over to the high priest, so that he may
man it with a garrison of his own choosing.

1 Ma 1 0:33 Every Jewish person taken from Judaea into captivity in any part of my kingdom I set free without
ransom, and decree that all will be exempt from taxes, even on their livestock.

IMa 10:34 All festivals, Sabbaths, New Moons and days of special observance, and the three days before and
three days after a festival, will be days of exemption and quittance for all the Jews in my kingdom,

1 Ma 1 0:35 and no one will have the right to exact payment from, or to molest, any of them for any matter
whatsoëver.

1 Ma 1 0:36 “Jews will be enrolled in the king’s forces to the number of thirty thousand men and receive
maintenance on the same scale as the rest of the king’s forces.

IMa 10:37 Some of them will be stationed in the king’s major fortresses, and from among others appointments
will be made to positions of trust in the kingdom. Their officers and commanders will be appointed from their own
number and will live under their own laws, as the king has prescribed for Judaea.



IMa 10:38 “As regards the three districts annexed to Judaea from the province of Samaria, these will be
integrated into Judaea and considered as coming under one governor, obeying the high priest’s authority and no
other.

IMa 10:39 Ptolemais and the land thereto pertaining I present to the sanctuary in Jerusalem, to meet the
necessary expenses of public worship.

IMa 10:40 And I make a personal grant of fifteen thousand silver shekels annually chargeable to the royal
revenue from appropriate places.

IMa 10:41 And the entire surplus, which has not been paid in by the officials as in previous years, will
henceforth be paid over by them for work on the Temple.

1 Ma 1 0:42 In addition, the sum of five thousand silver shekels, levied annually on the profits of the sanctuary, as
shown in the annual accounts, is also relinquished as the perquisite of the priests who perform the liturgy.

IMa 10:43 Anyone who takes refuge in the Temple in Jerusalem or any of its precincts, when in debt to the
royal exchequer or otherwise, will be discharged in full possession of all the goods he owns in my kingdom.

1 Ma 1 0:44 As regards the building and restoration of the sanctuary, the expense of the work will be met from
the royal exchequer.

IMa 10:45 The reconstruction of the walls of Jerusalem and the fortification of the perimeter will also be a
charge on the royal exchequer, as also the reconstruction of other city walls in Judaea”.

IMa 10:46 When Jonathan and the people heard these proposals, they put no faith in them and refused to
accept them, remembering what great wrongs Demetrius had done to Israel and how cruelly he had oppressed
them.

IMa 10:47 They decided in favour of Alexander, since he seemed to offer the better inducements of the two,
and they became his constant allies.

IMa 10:48 King Alexander now mustered large forces and advanced against Demetrius.

IMa 10:49 The two kings met in battle. Alexander’s army was routed, and Demetrius pursued him and defeated
his troops.

IMa 10:50 He continued the battle with vigour until sunset. Demetrius himself, however, was killed the same
day.

IMa 10:51 Alexander sent ambassadors to Ptolemy king of Egypt, with this message:

IMa 10:52 “Since I have returned to my kingdom, have ascended the throne of my ancestors, have gained
control by crushing Demetrius, and so recovered our country-

IMa 10:53 for I fought him and we crushed both him and his army, and I now occupy his royal throne-

1 Ma 1 0:54 let us now make a treaty of friendship. Give me your daughter in marriage: as your son-in-law, I shall

give you, and her, presents which are worthy of you”.

IMa 10:55 King Ptolemy replied as follows: “Happy the day when you returned to the land of your ancestors and
ascended their royal throne!

1 Ma 1 0:56 I shall at once do for you what your letter proposes; but meet me at Ptolemais, so that we can see
one another, and I shall become your father-in-law, as you have asked”.

IMa 10:57 Ptolemy left Egypt with his daughter Cleopatra and reached Ptolemais in the year 162.

1 Ma 1 0:58 King Alexander went to meet him, and Ptolemy gave him the hand of his daughter Cleopatra and

celebrated her wedding in Ptolemais with great magnificence, as kings do.

1 Ma 1 0:59 King Alexander then wrote to Jonathan to come and meet him.

1 Ma 1 0:60 Jonathan made his way in state to Ptolemais and met the two kings; he gave them and their friends
silver and gold, and many gifts, and made a favourable impression on them.

1 Ma 1 0:61 A number of scoundrels, the pest of Israel, combined to denounce him, but the king paid no attention
to them.

IMa 10:62 In fact, the king commanded that Jonathan should be divested of his own garments and clothed in
the purple, which was done.

IMa 10:63 The king then seated him by his side and said to his officers, “Escort him into the centre of the city
and proclaim that no one is to bring charges against him on any count; no one is to molest him for any reason”.
IMa 10:64 And so, when his accusers saw the honour done him by this proclamation, and Jonathan himself
invested in the purple, they all fled.

1 Ma 1 0:65 The king did him the honour of enrolling him among the First Friends, and appointed him
commander-in-chief and governor-general.

IMa 10:66 Jonathan then returned to Jerusalem in peace and gladness.

IMa 10:67 In the year 165, Demetrius son of Demetrius came from Crete to the land of his ancestors.

1 Ma 1 0:68 When King Alexander heard of it he was plunged into gloom, and retired to Antioch.

1 Ma 1 0:69 Demetrius confirmed Apollonius as governor of Coele-Syria; the latter assembled a large force,
encamped at Jamnia and sent the following message to Jonathan the high priest:

1 Ma 1 0:70 “You are entirely alone in rising against us, and now I find myself ridiculed and reproached on your



account. Why do you use your authority to our disadvantage in the mountains?

IMa 10:71 If you are so confident in your forces, come down now to meet us on the plain and let us take each
other’s measure there; on my side I have the strength of the towns.

1 Ma 1 0:72 Ask and learn who I am and who the others supporting us are. You will hear that you cannot stand
up to us, since your ancestors were twice routed on their own ground,

1 Ma 1 0:73 nor will you now be able to withstand the cavalry or so great an army on the plain, where there is
neither rock, nor stone, nor refuge of any kind”.

IMa 10:74 On hearing Apollonius’ words, Jonathan’s spirit was roused; he picked ten thousand men and left
Jerusalem, and his brother Simon joined him with reinforcements.

IMa 10:75 He drew up his forces outside Joppa, the citizens having shut him out, since Apollonius had a
garrison in Joppa. When they began the attack,

1 Ma 1 0:76 the citizens took fright and opened the gates, and Jonathan occupied Joppa.

1 Ma 1 0:77 Hearing this, Apollonius marshalled three thousand cavalry and a large army and made his way to
Azotus as though intending to march through, while in fact pressing on into the plain, since he had a great
number of cavalry on which he was relying.

1 Ma 1 0:78 Jonathan pursued him as far as Azotus, where the armies joined battle.

1 Ma 1 0:79 Now, Apollonius had left a thousand horsemen in concealment behind them.

IMa 10:80 Jonathan knew of this enemy position behind him; the horsemen surrounded his army, firing their
arrows into his men from morning until evening.

IMa 10:81 But the troops stood firm, as Jonathan had ordered. Once the cavalry was exhausted,

1 Ma 1 0:82 Simon sent his own troops into attack against the phalanx, which he cut to pieces and routed.

IMa 10:83 The cavalry scattered over the plain and fled to Azotus, where they took sanctuary in Beth-Dagon,
the temple of their idol.

IMa 10:84 Jonathan, however, set fire to Azotus and the surrounding towns, plundered them, and burned down
the temple of Dagon, with all the fugitives who had crowded into it.

1 Ma 1 0:85 The enemy losses, counting those who fell by the sword and those burnt to death, totalled about
eight thousand men.

IMa 10:86 Jonathan then left and pitched camp outside Ascalon, where the citizens came out to meet him with
great ceremony.

IMa 10:87 Jonathan then returned to Jerusalem with his followers, laden with booty.

IMa 10:88 In the event, when King Alexander heard what had happened, he awarded Jonathan further
honours:

IMa 10:89 he sent him the golden brooch, of the kind customarily presented to the King’s Cousins, and gave
him proprietary rights over Ekron and the land adjoining it.

IMa 11:1 The king of Egypt then assembled an army as numerous as the sands of the seashore, with many
ships, and set out to take possession of Alexander’s kingdom by a ruse and add it to his own kingdom.

1 Ma 1 1 :2 He set off for Syria with protestations of peace, and the people of the towns opened their gates to him
and came out to meet him, since King Alexander’s orders were to welcome him, Ptolemy being his father-in-law.
1 Ma 1 1 :3 On entering the towns, however, Ptolemy quartered troops as a garrison in each one.

IMa 1 1 :4 When he reached Azotus he was shown the burnt-out temple of Dagon, with Azotus and its suburbs
in ruins, corpses scattered here and there, and the charred remains of those whom Jonathan had burnt to death
in the battle, piled into heaps along his route.

IMa 1 1 :5 They explained to the king what Jonathan had done, hoping for his disapproval; but the king said
nothing.

IMa 11:6 Jonathan went in state to meet the king at Joppa, where they greeted each other and spent the night.
IMa 1 1 :7 Jonathan accompanied the king as far as the river called Eleutherus, and then returned to Jerusalem.
IMa 11:8 King Ptolemy for his part occupied the coastal towns as far as Seleucia on the coast, all the while
maturing his wicked designs against Alexander.

1 Ma 1 1 :9 He sent envoys to King Demetrius to say, “Come and let us make a treaty; I shall give you my
daughter, whom Alexander now has, and you shall rule your father’s kingdom.

IMa 1 1:10 I regret having given my daughter to that man, since he has tried to kill me”.

1 Ma 11:11 He made this accusation because he coveted his kingdom.

IMa 11:12 Having carried off his daughter and bestowed her on Demetrius, he broke with Alexander, and their
enmity became open.

IMa 11:13 Ptolemy next entered Antioch and assumed the crown of Asia; he now wore on his head the two
crowns of Egypt and Asia.

IMa 11:14 King Alexander was in Cilicia at the time, since the people of those parts had risen in revolt,

IMa 11:15 but when he heard the news, he advanced on his rival to give battle, while Ptolemy for his part also
took the field, met him with a strong force and routed him.



IMa 11:16 Alexander fled to Arabia for refuge, and King Ptolemy reigned supreme.

IMa 11:17 Zabdiel the Arab cut off Alexander’s head and sent it to Ptolemy.

IMa 11:18 Three days later King Ptolemy died, and the Egyptian garrisons in the strongholds were killed by the
local inhabitants.

IMa 11:19 So Demetrius became king in the year 167.

1 Ma 1 1 :20 At the same time, Jonathan mustered the men of Judaea for an assault on the Citadel of Jerusalem,
and they set up numerous siege-engines against it.

IMa 1 1 :21 But some renegades who hated their nation made their way to the king and told him that Jonathan
was besieging the Citadel.

1 Ma 1 1 :22 The king was angered by the news. No sooner had he been informed than he set out and came to
Ptolemais. He wrote to Jonathan, telling him to raise the siege and to meet him for a conference in Ptolemais as
soon as possible.

1 Ma 1 1 :23 When Jonathan heard this, he gave orders for the siege to continue; he then selected a deputation
from the elders of Israel and the priests, and took the deliberate risk

1 Ma 1 1 :24 of himself taking silver and gold, clothing and numerous other presents, and going to Ptolemais to
face the king, whose favour he succeeded in winning;

1 Ma 1 1 :25 and although one or two renegades of his nation brought charges against him,

IMa 11:26 the king treated him as his predecessors had treated him, and promoted him in the presence of all
his friends.

1 Ma 1 1 :27 He confirmed him in the high-priesthood and whatever other distinctions he already held, and had
him ranked among the First Friends.

1 Ma 1 1 :28 Jonathan asked the king to exempt Judaea and the three Samaritan districts from taxation,
promising him three hundred talants in return.

1 Ma 1 1 :29 The king consented, and wrote Jonathan a rescript covering the whole matter, in these terms:

1 Ma 1 1 :30 “King Demetrius to Jonathan his brother, and to the Jewish nation, greetings.

1 Ma 1 1 :31 “We have written to Lasthenes our cousin concerning you, and now send you this copy of our
rescript for your own information:

1 Ma 1 1 :32 ‘King Demetrius to his father Lasthenes, greetings.

1 Ma 1 1 :33 ‘The nation of the Jews is our ally; they fulfil their obligations to us, and in view of their goodwill
towards us we have decided to show them our bounty.

1 Ma 1 1 :34 We confirm them in their possession of the territory of Judaea and the three districts of Aphairema,
Lydda and Ramathaim; these were annexed to Judaea from Samaritan territory, with all their dependencies, in
favour of all who offer sacrifice in Jerusalem, instead of the royal dues which the king formerly received from
them every year, from the yield of the soil and the fruit crops.

1 Ma 1 1 :35 As regards our other rights over the tithes and taxes due to us, over the salt marshes, and the crown
taxes due to us, as from today we release them from them all.

1 Ma 1 1 :36 None of these grants will be revoked henceforth or anywhere.

1 Ma 1 1 :37 You will make yourself responsible for having a copy of this made, to be given to Jonathan and
displayed on the holy mountain in a conspicuous place’”.

1 Ma 1 1 :38 When King Demetrius saw that the country was at peace under his rule and that no resistance was
offered him, he dismissed his forces, and sent all the men home, except for the foreign troops that he had
recruited in the foreign island, thus incurring the enmity of the veterans who had served his ancestors.

IMa 1 1 :39 Now Trypho, one of Alexander’s former supporters, noting that all the troops were muttering against
Demetrius, went to see lamleku, the Arab who was bringing up Antiochus, Alexander’s young son,

1 Ma 1 1 :40 and repeatedly urged him to let him have the boy, so that he might succeed his father as king; he
told him of Demetrius’ decision and of the resentment it had aroused among his troops. He spent a long time
there.

1 Ma 1 1 :41 Jonathan, meanwhile, sent to ask King Demetrius to withdraw the garrisons from the Citadel in
Jerusalem and from the other fortresses, since they were constantly fighting Israel.

1 Ma 1 1 :42 Demetrius sent word back to Jonathan, “Not only will I do this for you and for your nation, but I shall
heap honours on you and your nation if I find a favourable opportunity.

1 Ma 1 1 :43 For the present, you would do well to send me reinforcements, since all my troops have deserted”.

1 Ma 1 1 :44 Jonathan sent three thousand experienced soldiers to him in Antioch; when they reached the king,
he was delighted at their arrival.

1 Ma 1 1 :45 The citizens crowded together in the centre of the city, to the number of some hundred and twenty
thousand, intending to kill the king.

1 Ma 1 1 :46 The king took refuge in the palace, while the citizens occupied the thoroughfares of the city and
began to attack.

1 Ma 1 1 :47 The king then called on the Jews for help; and these all rallied round him, then fanned out through



the city, and that day killed about a hundred thousand of its inhabitants.

1 Ma 1 1 :48 They fired the city, seizing a great deal of plunder at the same time, and secured the king’s safety.

1 Ma 1 1 :49 When the citizens saw that the Jews had the city at their mercy, their courage failed them, and they
made an abject appeal to the king,

1 Ma 1 1 :50 “Give us the right hand of peace, and let the Jews stop their fight against us and the city”.

1 Ma 1 1 :51 They threw down their arms and made peace. The Jews were covered in glory, in the eyes of the
king and of everyone else in his kingdom. Having won renown in his kingdom, they returned to Jerusalem laden
with booty.

1 Ma 1 1 :52 Thus, King Demetrius sat all the more securely on his royal throne, and the country was quiet under
his government.

1 Ma 1 1 :53 But he gave the lie to all the promises he had made, and changed his attitude to Jonathan, giving
nothing in return for the services Jonathan had rendered him, but thwarting him at every turn.

IMa 11:54 After this, Trypho came back with the little boy Antiochus, who became king and was crowned.

1 Ma 1 1 :55 All the troops that Demetrius had summarily dismissed rallied to Antiochus, and made war on
Demetrius, who turned tail and fled.

1 Ma 1 1 :56 Trypho captured the elephants and seized Antioch.

1 Ma 1 1 :57 Young Antiochus then wrote as follows to Jonathan: “I confirm you in the high-priesthood and set you
over the four districts and appoint you one of the Friends of the King”.

1 Ma 1 1 :58 He sent him a service of gold plate, and granted him the right to drink from gold vessels, and to wear
the purple and the golden brooch.

1 Ma 1 1 :59 He appointed his brother Simon commander-in-chief of the region from the Ladder of Tyre to the
frontiers of Egypt.

1 Ma 1 1 :60 Jonathan then set out and made a progress through Transeuphrates and its towns, and the entire
Syrian army rallied to his support. He came to Ascalon and was received in state by the inhabitants.

1 Ma 1 1 :61 From there he proceeded to Gaza, but the people of Gaza shut him out, so he laid siege to it,
burning down its suburbs and plundering them.

1 Ma 1 1 :62 The people of Gaza then pleaded with Jonathan, and he made peace with them; but he took the
sons of their chief men as hostages and sent them away to Jerusalem. He then travelled through the country as
far as Damascus.

1 Ma 1 1 :63 Jonathan now learned that Demetrius’ generals had arrived at Kadesh in Galilee with a large army,
intending to remove him from office,

1 Ma 1 1 :64 and went to engage them, leaving his brother Simon inside the country.

1 Ma 1 1 :65 Simon laid siege to Beth-Zur, attacking it day after day, and blockading the inhabitants
1 Ma 1 1 :66 until they sued for peace, which he granted them, though he expelled them from the town and
occupied it, stationing a garrison there.

1 Ma 1 1 :67 Jonathan and his army, meanwhile, having pitched camp by the Lake of Gennesar, rose early, and
by morning were already in the plain of Hazor.

1 Ma 1 1 :68 The foreigners’ army advanced to fight them on the plain, having first positioned an ambush for him
in the mountains. While the main body was advancing directly towards the Jews,

1 Ma 1 1 :69 the troops in ambush broke cover and attacked first.

1 Ma 1 1 :70 All the men with Jonathan fled; no one was left, except Mattathias son of Absalom and Judas son of
Chalphi, the generals of his army.

IMa 1 1:71 At this, Jonathan tore his garments, put dust on his head, and prayed.

1 Ma 1 1 :72 Then he returned to the fight and routed the enemy, who fled.

1 Ma 1 1 :73 When the fugitives from his own forces saw this, they came back to him and joined in the pursuit as
far as Kadesh where the enemy encampment was, and there they themselves pitched camp.

1 Ma 1 1 :74 About three thousand of the foreign troops fell that day. Jonathan then returned to Jerusalem.

IMa 12:1 When Jonathan saw that circumstances were working in his favour, he sent a select mission to Rome
to confirm and renew his treaty of friendship with the Romans.

IMa 12:2 He also sent letters to the same effect to the Spartans and to other places.

IMa 12:3 The envoys made their way to Rome, entered the Senate and said, “Jonathan the high priest and the
Jewish nation have sent us to renew your treaty of friendship and alliance with them as before”.

IMa 12:4 The Senate gave them letters to the authorities of each place, to procure their safe conduct to
Judaea.

IMa 12:5 The following is the copy of the letter Jonathan wrote to the Spartans:

IMa 12:6 “Jonathan the high priest, the senate of the nation, the priests and the rest of the Jewish people to the
Spartans their brothers, greetings.

1 Ma 1 2:7 “In the past, a letter was sent to Onias, the high priest, from Areios, one of your kings, stating that you
are indeed our brothers, as the copy subjoined attests.



IMa 12:8 Onias received the envoy with honour, and accepted the letter, in which a clear declaration was made
of friendship and alliance.

IMa 12:9 For our part, though we have no need of these, having the consolation of the holy books in our
possession,

IMa 12:10 we venture to send to renew ourfraternal friendship with you, so that we may not become strangers
to you, a long time having elapsed since you last wrote to us.

IMa 12:11 We, for our part, on every occasion, at our festivals and on other appointed days, unfailingly
remember you in the sacrifices we offer and in our prayers, as it is right and fitting to remember brothers.

IMa 12:12 We rejoice in your renown.

IMa 12:13 “We ourselves, however, have had many trials and many wars, the neighbouring kings making war
on us.

IMa 12:14 We were unwilling to trouble you or our other allies and friends during these wars,

IMa 12:15 since we have the support of Heaven to help us, thanks to which we have been delivered from our
enemies, and they are the ones who have been brought low.

IMa 12:16 We have therefore chosen Numenius son of Antiochus, and Antipater son of Jason, and sent them
to the Romans to renew our former treaty of friendship and alliance,

IMa 12:17 and we have ordered them also to visit you, to greet you and deliver you this letter of ours
concerning the renewal of our brotherhood;

IMa 12:18 we shall be grateful for an answer to it”.

IMa 12:19 The following is the copy of the letter sent to Onias:

IMa 12:20 “Areios king of the Spartans, to Onias the high priest, greetings.

IMa 12:21 “It has been discovered in records regarding the Spartans and Jews that they are brothers, and of
the race of Abraham.

1 Ma 1 2:22 Now that this has come to our knowledge, we shall be obliged if you will send us news of your
welfare.

IMa 12:23 Our own message to you is this: your flocks and your possessions are ours, and ours are yours, and
we are instructing our envoys to give you a message to this effect”.

IMa 12:24 Jonathan learned that Demetrius’ generals had returned with a larger army than before to make war
on him.

IMa 12:25 He therefore left Jerusalem and went to engage them in the area of Hamath, not giving them the
time to invade his own territory.

1 Ma 12:26 He sent spies into their camp, who told him on their return that the enemy were taking up positions
for a night attack on the Jews.

1 Ma 12:27 At sunset, Jonathan ordered his men to keep watch with their weapons at hand, in readiness to fight
at any time during the night, and posted advance guards all round the camp.

IMa 12:28 On learning that Jonathan and his men were ready to fight, the enemy took fright and, with quaking
hearts, lit fires in their bivouac and decamped.

IMa 12:29 Jonathan and his men, watching the glow of the fires, were unaware of their withdrawal until
morning,

IMa 12:30 and although Jonathan pursued them, he failed to overtake them, for they had already crossed the
river Eleutherus.

IMa 12:31 So Jonathan wheeled round on the Arabs called Zabadaeans, beat them and plundered them;

IMa 12:32 then, breaking camp, he went to Damascus, thus crossing the whole province.

IMa 12:33 Simon, meanwhile, had also set out and had penetrated as far as Ascalon and the neighbouring
towns. He then turned on Joppa and moved quickly to occupy it,

IMa 1 2:34 for he had heard of their intention to hand over this strong point to the supporters of Demetrius; he
stationed a garrison there to hold it.

IMa 12:35 Jonathan, on his return, called a meeting of the elders of the people and decided with them to build
fortresses in Judaea

IMa 12:36 and to heighten the walls of Jerusalem and erect a high barrier between the Citadel and the city, to
cut the former off from the city and isolate it, to prevent the occupants from buying or selling.

IMa 12:37 Rebuilding the city was a co-operative effort: part of the wall over the eastern ravine had fallen down;
he restored the quarter called Chaphenatha.

IMa 12:38 Simon, meanwhile, rebuilt Adida in the lowlands, fortifying it, and erecting gates with bolts.

IMa 12:39 Trypho’s ambition was to become king of Asia, assume the crown, and overpower King Antiochus.

1 Ma 1 2:40 He was apprehensive that Jonathan might not allow him to do this, and might even make war on
him, so he set out and came to Beth-Shean, in the hopes of finding some pretext for having him arrested and put
to death.

IMa 12:41 Jonathan went out to intercept him, with forty thousand picked men in battle order, and arrived at



Beth-Shean.

IMa 12:42 When Trypho saw him there with a large force, he hesitated to make any move against him.

IMa 12:43 He even received him with honour, commended him to all his friends, gave him presents and
ordered his friends and his troops to obey him as they would himself.

IMa 12:44 He said to Jonathan, “Why have you given all these people so much trouble, when there is no threat
of war between us?

1 Ma 1 2:45 Send them back home; pick yourself a few men as your bodyguard, and come with me to Ptolemais,
which I am going to hand over to you, with the other fortresses and the remaining troops and all the officials;
after which, I shall take the road for home. This was my purpose in coming here”.

IMa 12:46 Jonathan trusted him and did as he said; he dismissed his forces, who went back to Judaea.

IMa 12:47 With him he retained three thousand men, of whom he left two thousand in Galilee, while a thousand
accompanied him.

IMa 12:48 But as soon as Jonathan had entered Ptolemais, the people of Ptolemais closed the gates, seized
him, and put all those who had entered with him to the sword.

IMa 12:49 Trypho sent troops and cavalry into Galilee and the Great Plain to destroy all Jonathan’s supporters.
IMa 12:50 These, concluding that he had been taken and had perished with his companions, encouraged one
another, marching with closed ranks and ready to give battle,

IMa 12:51 and when their pursuers saw that they would fight for their lives, they turned back.

IMa 12:52 All reached Judaea safe and sound, and there they lamented Jonathan and his companions, being
very frightened indeed; all Israel was plunged into mourning.

IMa 12:53 The surrounding nations were all now looking for ways of destroying them: “They have no leader”,
they said, “no ally; we have only to attack them now, and we shall blot out their very memory from all peoples”.
IMa 13:1 Simon heard that Trypho had collected a large army to invade and devastate Judaea,

1 Ma 1 3:2 and when he saw how the people were quaking with fear, he went up to Jerusalem, called the people

together,

1 Ma 1 3:3 and exhorted them thus, “You know yourselves how much I and my brothers and my father’s family
have done for the laws and the sanctuary; you know what wars and hardships we have experienced.

IMa 13:4 That is why my brothers are all dead, for Israel’s sake, and I am the only one left.

1 Ma 1 3:5 Far be it from me, then, to be sparing of my own life in any time of oppression, for I am not worth more

than my brothers.

1 Ma 1 3:6 Rather will I avenge my nation and the sanctuary and your wives and children, now that the foreigners
are all united in malice to destroy us”.

1 Ma 1 3:7 The people’s spirit rekindled as they listened to his words,

1 Ma 1 3:8 and they shouted back at him, “You are our leader in place of Judas and your brother Jonathan.

1 Ma 1 3:9 Fight our battles for us, and we will do whatever you tell us”.

IMa 13:10 So he assembled all the fighting men and hurried on with completing the walls of Jerusalem,
fortifying the whole perimeter.

IMa 13:1 1 He sent a considerable force to Joppa under Jonathan son of Absalom who drove out the inhabitants
and remained there in occupation.

IMa 13:12 Trypho now left Ptolemais with a large army to invade Judaea, taking Jonathan with him under
guard.

IMa 13:13 Simon pitched camp in Adida, facing the plain.

IMa 13:14 When Trypho learned that Simon had taken the place of his brother Jonathan and that he intended
to join battle with him, he sent envoys to him with this message,

IMa 13:15 “Your brother Jonathan was in debt to the royal exchequer for the offices he held; that is why we are
detaining him.

IMa 13:16 If you send a hundred talants of silver and two of his sons as hostages, to make sure that on his
release he does not revolt against us, we shall release him”.

IMa 13:17 Although Simon was aware that the message was a ruse, he sent for the money and the boys for
fear of incurring great hostility from the people,

IMa 13:18 who would have said that Jonathan had died because Simon would not send Trypho the money and
the children.

IMa 13:19 He therefore sent both the boys and the hundred talants, but Trypho broke his word and did not
release Jonathan.

1 Ma 1 3:20 Next, T rypho set about the invasion and devastation of the country; he made a detour along the
Adora road, but Simon and his army confronted him wherever he attempted to go.

IMa 13:21 The men in the Citadel kept sending messengers to Trypho, urging him to get through to them by
way of the desert and send them supplies.

IMa 13:22 Trypho organised his entire cavalry to go, but that night it snowed so heavily that he could not get



through for the snow, so he left there and moved off into Gilead.

IMa 13:23 As he approached Baskama he killed Jonathan, who was buried there.

IMa 13:24 Trypho turned back and regained his own country.

1 Ma 1 3:25 Simon sent and recovered the bones of his brother Jonathan, and buried him in Modein, the town of
his ancestors.

IMa 13:26 All Israel kept solemn mourning for him and long bewailed him.

1 Ma 1 3:27 Over the tomb of his father and brothers, Simon raised a monument high enough to catch the eye,
using dressed stone back and front.

IMa 13:28 He erected seven pyramids facing each other, for his father and mother and his four brothers,

IMa 13:29 surrounding them with a structure consisting of tall columns surmounted by trophies of arms to their
everlasting memory and, beside the trophies of arms, ships sculpted on a scale to be seen by all who sail the
sea.

IMa 13:30 Such was the monument he constructed at Modein, and it is still there today.

IMa 13:31 Now Trypho, betraying the trust of young King Antiochus, put him to death.

1 Ma 1 3:32 He usurped his throne, assuming the crown of Asia, and brought great havoc on the country.

1 Ma 1 3:33 Simon built up the fortresses of Judaea, surrounding them with high towers, great walls and gates
with bolts, and stocked these fortresses with food.

1 Ma 1 3:34 He also sent a delegation to King Demetrius, to get him to grant the province a remission, since all
Trypho did was to despoil.

IMa 13:35 King Demetrius replied to his request in a letter framed as follows:

1 Ma 1 3:36 “King Demetrius to Simon, high priest and Friend of Kings, and to the elders and nation of the Jews,
greetings.

IMa 13:37 “It has pleased us to accept the golden crown and the palm you have sent us, and we are disposed
to make a general peace with you, and to write to the officials to grant you remissions.

IMa 13:38 Everything that we have decreed concerning you remains in force, and the fortresses you have built
may remain in your hands.

IMa 13:39 We pardon all offences, unwitting or intentional, hitherto committed, and remit the crown tax you now
owe us; and whatever other taxes were levied in Jerusalem are no longer to be levied.

1 Ma 1 3:40 If any of you are suitable for enrolment in our bodyguard, let them be enrolled, and let there be
peace between us”.

IMa 13:41 The gentile yoke was thus lifted from Israel in the year 170,

1 Ma 1 3:42 when our people began engrossing their documents and contracts: “In the first year of Simon,
eminent high priest, commander-in-chief and ethnarch of the Jews”.

1 Ma 1 3:43 About that time Simon laid siege to Gezer, surrounding it with his troops. He constructed a mobile
tower, brought it up to the city, opened a breach in one of the bastions and took it.

IMa 13:44 The men in the mobile tower sprang out into the city, where great confusion ensued.

1 Ma 1 3:45 The citizens, accompanied by their wives and children, mounted the ramparts with their garments
torn and loudly implored Simon to make peace with them:

IMa 13:46 “Treat us”, they said, “not as our wickedness deserves, but as your mercy prompts you”.

IMa 13:47 Simon came to terms with them and stopped the fighting; but he expelled them from the city, purified
the houses which contained idols, and then made his entry with songs of praise.

IMa 13:48 He banished all impurity from it, settled in it people who observed the Law, and having fortified it,
built a residence there for himself.

IMa 13:49 The occupants of the Citadel in Jerusalem, prevented as they were from coming out and going into
the countryside to buy and sell, were in desperate need of food, and numbers of them were being carried off by
starvation.

IMa 13:50 They begged Simon to make peace with them, and he granted this, though he expelled them and
purified the Citadel from its pollutions.

IMa 13:51 The Jews made their entry on the twenty-third day of the second month in the year 171, with
acclamations and carrying palms, to the sound of lyres, cymbals and harps, chanting hymns and canticles, since
a great enemy had been crushed and thrown out of Israel. Simon made it a day of annual rejoicing.

IMa 13:52 He fortified the Temple hill on the Citadel side, and took up residence there with his men.

IMa 13:53 Since his son John had come to manhood, Simon appointed him general-in-chief, with his residence
in Gezer.

IMa 14:1 In the year 172, King Demetrius assembled his forces and marched into Media to raise help for the
fight against Trypho.

IMa 14:2 When Arsaces king of Persia and Media heard that Demetrius had entered his territory, he sent one of
his generals to capture him alive.

IMa 14:3 The general defeated the army of Demetrius, seized him and brought him to Arsaces, who imprisoned



him.

IMa 14:4 The country was at peace throughout the days of Simon. He sought the good of his nation and they
were well pleased with his authority, as with his magnificence, throughout his life.

IMa 14:5 To crown his titles to glory, he took Joppa and made it a harbour, gaining access to the Mediterranean
Isles.

IMa 14:6 He enlarged the frontiers of his nation, keeping his mastery over the homeland,

IMa 14:7 resettling a host of captives. He conquered Gezer, Beth-Zur and the Citadel, ridding them of every
impurity, and no one could resist him.

IMa 14:8 The people farmed their land in peace; the land gave its produce, the trees of the plain their fruit.

IMa 14:9 The elders sat at ease in the squares, all their talk was of their prosperity; the young men wore
splendid armour.

IMa 14:10 He kept the towns supplied with provisions and furnished with fortifications, until his fame resounded
to the ends of the earth.

IMa 14:1 1 He established peace in the land, and Israel knew great joy.

IMa 14:12 Each man sat under his own vine and his own fig tree, and there was no one to make them afraid.
IMa 14:13 No enemy was left in the land to fight them, the very kings of those times had been crushed.

IMa 14:14 He encouraged the afflicted members of his people, suppressing every wicked man and renegade.
He strove to observe the Law,

IMa 14:15 and gave new splendour to the Temple, enriching it with many sacred vessels.

IMa 14:16 When it became known in Rome and as far as Sparta that Jonathan was dead, people were deeply
grieved.

IMa 14:17 But as soon as they heard that his brother Simon had succeeded him as high priest and was master
of the country and the cities in it,

IMa 14:18 they wrote to him on bronze tablets to renew the treaty of friendship and alliance which they had
made with his brothers, Judas and Jonathan,

IMa 14:19 and the document was read out before the assembly in Jerusalem.

1 Ma 14:20 This is the copy of the letter sent by the Spartans: “The rulers and the city of Sparta, to Simon the
high priest and to the elders and priests and the rest of the people of the Jews, greetings.

IMa 14:21 “The ambassadors whom you sent to our people have informed us of your glory and prosperity, and
we are delighted with their visit.

IMa 14:22 We have recorded their declarations in the minutes of our public assemblies, as follows, ‘Numenius
son of Antiochus, and Antipater son of Jason, ambassadors of the Jews, came to us to renew their friendship
with us.

1 Ma 14:23 And it was the people’s pleasure to receive these personages with honour and to deposit a copy of
their statements in the public archives, so that the people of Sparta might preserve a record of them. A copy was
also made for Simon the high priest’”.

IMa 14:24 After this, Simon sent Numenius to Rome as the bearer of a large golden shield weighing a thousand
mina, to confirm the alliance with them.

IMa 14:25 When these events were reported to our people, they said, “What mark of appreciation shall we give
to Simon and his sons?

IMa 14:26 He stood firm, he and his brothers and his father’s house: he fought off the enemies of Israel and
secured its freedom”. So they recorded an inscription on bronze tablets and set it up on pillars on Mount Zion.

1 Ma 14:27 This is a copy of the text: “The eighteenth of Elul, in the year 1 72, being the third year of Simon,
eminent high priest:

IMa 14:28 “In Asaramel, in the Grand Assembly of priests and people, of princes of the nation and of elders of
the country: “We are acquainted with the matters following:

IMa 14:29 “When there was almost incessant fighting in the country Simon, son of Mattathias, a priest of the
line of Joarib, and his brothers courted danger and withstood their nation’s enemies to safeguard the integrity of
their sanctuary and of the Law, and so brought their nation great glory;

IMa 14:30 “For when, Jonathan having rallied his nation and become its high priest and having then been
gathered to his ancestors,

IMa 14:31 the enemy planned to invade the country, intending to devastate their territory and to lay hands on
their sanctuary,

IMa 14:32 Simon next came forward to fight for his nation: spending much of his personal wealth on arming his
nation’s fighting men and on providing their pay;

1 Ma 14:33 fortifying the towns of Judaea, as well as Beth-Zur on the Judaean frontier where the enemy arsenal
had formerly been, and stationing in it a garrison of Jewish soldiers;

1 Ma 14:34 fortifying Joppa on the coast, and Gezer on the borders of Azotus, a place formerly inhabited by the
enemy, founding a Jewish colony there, and providing the settlers with everything they needed to set them on



their feet;

IMa 14:35 “In consequence of which, the people, aware of Simon’s loyalty and of the glory which he was
determined to win for his nation, have made him their ethnarch and high priest, for all his services and for the
integrity and loyalty which he has shown towards his nation, and for having by every means sought to enhance
his people’s power;

1 Ma 1 4:36 “It has fallen to him in his time to expel the foreigners from his country, including those in the City of
David in Jerusalem, who had converted it into a citadel for their own use, from which they would sally out to
defile the surroundings of the sanctuary and to violate its sacred character;

IMa 14:37 to station Jewish soldiers there instead for the security of the country and the city; and to heighten
the walls of Jerusalem;

IMa 1 4:38 “And since King Demetrius has heard that the Romans call the Jews their friends, allies and brothers,
IMa 14:39 and that they have given an honourable reception to Simon’s ambassadors, and, furthermore,

1 Ma 14:40 that the Jews and priests are happy that Simon should, pending the advent of a genuine prophet, be
their ethnarch and high priest for life

IMa 14:41 therefore he has confirmed him in the high-priestly office, has raised him to the rank of Friend and
has showered great honours on him, also confirming him as their commander-in-chief,

1 Ma 1 4:42 with the right to appoint officials to oversee the fabric of the sanctuary and to administer the country,
munitions and fortresses;

IMa 14:43 he is to have personal charge of the sanctuary, and to be obeyed by all; all official documents in the
country must be drawn up in his name; and he may assume the purple and may wear golden ornaments;

1 Ma 1 4:44 “Furthermore, it is against the law for any member of the public or of the priesthood to contravene
any of these enactments or to contest his decisions, or to convene a meeting anywhere in the country without his
permission, or to assume the purple or wear the golden brooch;

IMa 14:45 and anyone acting contrary to, or rejecting any article of, these enactments is liable to punishment;
IMa 14:46 “And since the people have unanimously agreed to grant Simon the right to act as aforesaid, and
IMa 14:47 since Simon, for his part, has given his assent, and has consented to assume the high-priestly office
and to be commander-in-chief and ethnarch of the Jews and their priests, and to preside over all:

IMa 14:48 “So, be it now enacted: that this record be inscribed on bronze tablets and be erected at some
conspicuous place within the precincts of the Temple,

1 Ma 1 4:49 and that copies be deposited in the T reasury for Simon and his descendants”.

IMa 15:1 Antiochus son of King Demetrius addressed a letter from the Mediterranean Isles to Simon, priest and
ethnarch of the Jews, and to the whole nation;

IMa 15:2 this was how it read: “King Antiochus to Simon, high priest and ethnarch, and to the Jewish nation,
greetings.

IMa 15:3 “Whereas certain scoundrels have seized control of the kingdom of our fathers, and I propose to claim
back the kingdom so that I may re-establish it as it was before, and whereäs I have accordingly recruited very
large forces and fitted out warships,

IMa 15:4 intending to make a landing in the country and to hunt down the men who have ruined it and laid
waste many towns in my kingdom;

1 Ma 1 5:5 “I now, therefore, confirm in your favour all remissions of taxes granted to you by the kings my
predecessors, as well as the waiving of whatever presents they may have conceded.

1 Ma 1 5:6 I hereby authorise you to mint your own coinage as legal tender for your own country.

IMa 15:7 I declare Jerusalem and the sanctuary to be free; all the arms you have manufactured and the
fortresses you have built and now occupy may remain yours.

IMa 15:8 All debts to the royal treasury, present or future, are cancelled henceforth in perpetuity.

IMa 15:9 Furthermore, when we have won back our kingdom, we shall bestow such great honour on yourself,
your nation and the sanctuary as will make your glory known throughout the world”.

IMa 15:10 Antiochus invaded the land of his ancestors in the year 174 and, since the troops all rallied to him,
Trypho was left with few supporters.

IMa 15:1 1 Antiochus pursued the usurper, who took refuge in Dora on the coast,

IMa 15:12 knowing that misfortunes were piling up on him and that his troops had deserted him.

IMa 15:13 Antiochus pitched camp outside Dora with a hundred and twenty thousand fighting men and eight
thousand cavalry.

IMa 15:14 He laid siege to the city while the ships closed in from the sea, so that he had the city under attack
from land and sea, and allowed no one to go in or come out.

IMa 15:15 Numenius and his companions, meanwhile, arrived from Rome, bringing letters addressed to various
kings and states, in the following terms:

IMa 15:16 “Lucius, consul of the Romans, to King Ptolemy, greetings.

IMa 15:17 “The Jewish ambassadors have come to us as our friends and allies to renew our original friendship



and alliance in the name of the high priest Simon and the Jewish people.

IMa 15:18 They have brought a golden shield worth a thousand mina.

IMa 15:19 Accordingly, we have seen fit to write to various kings and states, warning them neither to molest the
Jewish people nor to attack either them or their towns or their country, nor to ally themselves with any such
aggressors.

1 Ma 1 5:20 We have seen fit to accept the shield from them.

IMa 15:21 If, therefore, any scoundrels have fled their country to take refuge with you, hand them over to Simon
the high priest, to be punished by him according to their law”.

IMa 15:22 The consul sent the same letter to King Demetrius, to Attalus, Ariarathes and Arsaces,

IMa 15:23 and to all states, including Sampsames, the Spartans, Delos, Myndos, Sicyon, Caria, Samos,
Pamphylia, Lycia, Halicarnassus, Rhodes, Phaselis, Cos, Side, Arados, Gortyn, Cyprus and Cyrene.

1 Ma 1 5:24 They also drew up a copy for Simon the high priest.

1 Ma 15:25 Antiochus, meanwhile, from his positions on the outskirts of Dora, was continually throwing
detachments against the town. He constructed siege-engines, and blockaded Trypho, preventing movement in
or out.

IMa 15:26 Simon sent him two thousand picked men to support him in the fight, with silver and gold and plenty
of equipment.

IMa 15:27 But Antiochus would not accept them; instead, he repudiated all his previous agreements with Simon
and completely changed his attitude to him.

1 Ma 1 5:28 He sent him Athenobius, one of his Friends, to confer with him and say, “You are now occupying
Joppa and Gezer and the Citadel in Jerusalem, which are towns in my kingdom.

1 Ma 1 5:29 You have laid waste their territory and done immense harm to the country; and you have seized
control of many places properly in my kingdom.

1 Ma 1 5:30 Either now surrender the towns you have taken and the taxes from the places you have seized
outside the frontiers of Judaea,

1 Ma 1 5:31 or else pay me five hundred talants of silver in compensation for them and for the destruction you
have done, and another five hundred talants for the taxes from the towns; otherwise we shall come and make
war on you”.

IMa 15:32 When the King’s Friend, Athenobius, reached Jerusalem and saw Simon’s magnificence, his cabinet
of gold and silver plate and the state he kept, he was dumbfounded. He delivered the king’s message,

IMa 15:33 but Simon gave him this answer, “We have not taken foreign territory or any alien property but have
occupied our ancestral heritage, for some time unjustly wrested from us by our enemies;

IMa 15:34 now that we have a favourable opportunity, we are merely recovering our ancestral heritage.

IMa 15:35 As regards Joppa and Gezer, which you claim, these were towns that did great harm to our people
and laid waste our country; we are prepared to give a hundred talants for them”. Without so much as a word in
answer,

IMa 15:36 the envoy went back to the king in a rage and reported on Simon’s answer and his magnificence,
and on everything he had seen, at which the king fell into a fury.

IMa 15:37 Trypho now boarded a ship and escaped to Orthosia.

1 Ma 1 5:38 The king appointed Cendebaeus military governor of the coastal region and allotted him a force of
infantry and cavalry.

IMa 15:39 He ordered him to deploy his men facing Judaea, and instructed him to rebuild Kedron and fortify its
gates, and to make war on our people, while the king himself went in pursuit of T rypho.

IMa 15:40 Cendebaeus arrived at Jamnia and began to provoke our people forthwith, invading Judaea, taking
prisoners, and massacring.

IMa 15:41 Having rebuilt Kedron, he stationed cavalry and troops there to make sorties and patrol the roads of
Judaea, as the king had ordered.

IMa 16:1 John then went up from Gezer and reported to his father Simon what Cendebaeus was busy doing.
IMa 16:2 At this, Simon summoned his two elder sons, Judas and John, and said to them, “My brothers and I,
and my father’s House, have fought the enemies of Israel from our youth until today, and many a time we have
been successful in rescuing Israel.

IMa 16:3 But now I am an old man, while you, by the mercy of Heaven, are the right age; take the place of my
brother and myself, go out and fight for our nation, and may Heaven’s aid be with you”.

IMa 16:4 He then selected twenty thousand of the country’s fighting men and cavalry, and these marched
against Cendebaeus, spending the night at Modein.

IMa 16:5 Making an early start, they marched into the plain, to find a large army opposing them, both infantry
and cavalry; there was, however, a stream-bed in between.

IMa 16:6 John drew up facing them, he and his army and, seeing that the men were afraid to cross the stream-
bed, crossed over first himself. When his men saw this, they too crossed after him.



1 Ma 1 6:7 He divided his army into two, with the cavalry in the centre and the infantry on either flank, as the
opposing cavalry was very numerous.

1 Ma 1 6:8 The trumpets rang out; Cendebaeus and his army were put to flight, many of them falling mortally
wounded and the rest of them fleeing to the fortress.

1 Ma 1 6:9 Then it was that Judas, John’s brother, was wounded, but John pursued them until Cendebaeus
reached Kedron, which he had rebuilt.

IMa 16:10 Their flight took them as far as the towers in the countryside of Azotus, and John burnt these down.
The enemy losses amounted to ten thousand men; John returned safely to Judaea.

IMa 16:1 1 Ptolemy son of Abubos had been appointed general in command of the Plain of Jericho; he owned a
great deal of silver and gold,

IMa 16:12 and was the high priest’s son-in-law.

IMa 16:13 His ambition was fired; he hoped to make himself master of the whole country and therefore
treacherously began to plot the destruction of Simon and his sons.

IMa 16:14 Simon, who was inspecting the towns up and down the country and attending to their administration,
had come down to Jericho with his sons Mattathias and Judas, in the year 172, in the eleventh month, the month
of Shebat.

IMa 16:15 The son of Abubos lured them into a small fortress called Dok, which he had built, where he offered
them a great banquet, having previously hidden men in the place.

IMa 16:16 When Simon and his sons were drunk, Ptolemy and his men reached for their weapons, rushed on
Simon in the banqueting hall and killed him with his two sons and some of his servants.

IMa 16:17 He thus committed a great act of treachery and rendered evil for good.

IMa 16:18 Ptolemy wrote a report of the affair and sent it to the king, in the expectation of being sent
reinforcements and of having the cities and the province made over to him.

IMa 16:19 He also sent people to Gezerto murder John, and sent written orders to the military commanders to
come to him so that he could give them silver, gold and presents;

IMa 16:20 and he also sent others to seize control of Jerusalem and the Temple mount.

IMa 16:21 But someöne had been too quick for him and had already informed John in Gezer that his father and
brothers had perished, adding, “He is sending someöne to kill you too!”.

IMa 16:22 Overcome as John was by the news, he arrested the men who had come to kill him and put them to
death, being forewarned of their murderous design.

IMa 16:23 The rest of John’s acts, the battles he fought and the exploits he performed, the city walls he built,
and all his other achievements,

IMa 16:24 from the day he succeeded his father as high priest, are recorded in the annals of his pontificate.
2Ma 1:1 “To their brothers, the Jews living in Egypt, from their brothers, the Jews in Jerusalem and Judaea,
greetings and untroubled peace.

2Ma 1 :2 “May God prosper you, remembering his covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, his faithful
servants.

2Ma 1 :3 May he give you all a heart to worship him and to do his will with a generous mind and a willing spirit.
2Ma 1:4 May he open your hearts to his Law and his precepts, and give you peace.

2Ma 1 :5 May he hear your prayers and be reconciled with you, and not abandon you in time of evil.

2Ma 1:6 Such is our prayer for you.

2Ma 1:7 “During the reign of Demetrius, in the year 169, we Jews wrote to you as follows, ‘In the extremity of
trouble that befell us in the years after Jason and his associates had betrayed the Holy Land and the kingdom,

2Ma 1:8 burning down the Temple gateway and shedding innocent blood, we prayed to the Lord and were then

heard. And we then offered a sacrifice, with wheat-flour, we lit the lamps and we set out the loaves’.

2Ma 1 :9 “And we now recommend you too to keep the feast of Shelters in the month of Chislev, in the year one
hundred and eighty-eight”.

2Ma 1:10 “The people of Jerusalem and of Judaea, the senate and Judas, to Aristobulus, tutor to King Ptolemy
and one of the family of the anointed priests, and to the Jews in Egypt, greetings and good health.

2Ma 1:11 “Since we have been rescued by God from great danger, we give him great thanks for championing
our cause against the king,

2Ma 1:12 for he it was who carried off those who had taken up arms against the Holy City.

2Ma 1:13 For when their leader reached Persia with his seemingly irresistible army, he was cut to pieces in the
temple of Nanaea, as the result of a ruse employed by the priests who served that goddess.

2Ma 1:14 On the pretext of marrying Nanaea, Antiochus came to the place with his friends, intending to take its
many treasures as a dowry.

2Ma 1:15 The priests of Nanaea had put these on display, and he for his part had entered the temple precincts
with only a small retinue. As soon as Antiochus had gone inside the temple, the priests shut him in,

2Ma 1:16 opened a trap-door hidden in the ceiling and struck the leader down by hurling stones like



thunderbolts. They then cut him into pieces and threw his head to those who were waiting outside.

2Ma 1:17 Blessed in all things be our God, who has delivered the sacrilegious over to death!

2Ma 1:18 “As we shall be celebrating the purification of the Temple on the twenty-fifth of Chislev, we consider it
proper to notify you, so that you too may celebrate it, as you do the feast of Shelters and the fire that appeared
when Nehemiah, the builder of the Temple and the altar, offered sacrifice.

2Ma 1:19 For when our ancestors were being deported to Persia, the devout priests of the time took some of
the fire from the altar and hid it secretly in a hole like a dry well, where they concealed it in such a way that the
place was unknown to anyone.

2Ma 1 :20 When some years had elapsed, in God’s good time, Nehemiah, commissioned by the king of Persia,
sent the descendants of the priests who had hidden the fire to look for it. When they reported that in fact they
had found not fire but a thick liquid, Nehemiah ordered them to draw some out and bring it back.

2Ma 1 :21 When they had done this, Nehemiah ordered the priests to pour this liquid over the sacrificial
materials, that is, the wood and what lay on it.

2Ma 1:22 When this had been done, and when in due course the sun, which had previously been clouded over,
shone out, a great fire flared up, to the astonishment of all.

2Ma 1:23 While the sacrifice was being burned, the priests offered prayer, Jonathan intoning with all the priests,
and the rest responding with Nehemiah.

2Ma 1 :24 The prayer took this form, ‘Lord, Lord God, Creator of all things, awesome, strong, just, merciful, the
only king and benefactor,

2Ma 1 :25 the only provider, who alone are just, almighty and everlasting, the deliverer of Israel from every evil,
who made our fathers your chosen ones and sanctified them,

2Ma 1 :26 accept this sacrifice on behalf of all your people Israel, and protect your heritage and consecrate it.
2Ma 1 .21 Bring together those of us who are dispersed, set free those in slavery among the heathen, look
favourably on those held in contempt or abhorrence, and let the heathen know that you are our God.

2Ma 1 :28 Punish those who oppress us and affront us by their insolence,

2Ma 1 :29 and plant your people firmly in your Holy Place, as Moses promised’.

2Ma 1:30 “The priests then chanted hymns accompanied by the harp.

2Ma 1:31 When the sacrifice had been burnt, Nehemiah ordered the remaining liquid to be poured over large
stones,

2Ma 1 :32 and when this was done a flame flared up, to be absorbed in a corresponding blaze of light from the
altar.

2Ma 1:33 When the matter became known and the king of the Persians heard that, in the place where the exiled
priests had hidden the fire, a liquid had appeared, with which Nehemiah and his people had purified the
sacrificial offerings,

2Ma 1:34 the king, after verifying the facts, had the place enclosed and pronounced sacred.

2Ma 1:35 To the people on whom the king bestowed it, he granted a part of the considerable revenue he
derived from it.

2Ma 1:36 Nehemiah and his people termed this stuff ‘nephtar’, which means ‘purification’, but it is commonly
called ‘naphta’.

2Ma 2:1 “It is on record that the prophet Jeremiah ordered the deportees to take the fire, as we have described,
2Ma 2:2 and how, having given them the Law, the prophet warned the deportees never to forget the Lord’s
precepts, nor to let their thoughts be tempted by the sight of gold and silver statues or the finery adorning them.
2Ma 2:3 Among other similar admonitions, he urged them not to let the Law depart from their hearts.

2Ma 2:4 “The same document also describes how the prophet, warned by an oracle, gave orders for the tent
and the ark to go with him, when he set out for the mountain which Moses had climbed to survey God’s heritage.
2Ma 2:5 On his arrival, Jeremiah found a cave-dwelling, into which he put the tent, the ark and the altar of
incense, afterwards blocking up the entrance.

2Ma 2:6 Some of his companions went back later to mark out the path but were unable to find it.

2Ma 2:7 When Jeremiah learned this, he reproached them, ‘The place is to remain unknown’, he said, ‘until
God gathers his people together again and shows them his mercy.

2Ma 2:8 Then the Lord will bring these things once more to light, and the glory of the Lord will be seen, and so
will the cloud, as it was revealed in the time of Moses and when Solomon prayed that the holy place might be
gloriously hallowed’.

2Ma 2:9 “It was also recorded how Solomon in his wisdom offered the sacrifice of the dedication and completion
of the sanctuary.

2Ma 2:10 As Moses had prayed to the Lord and fire had come down from heaven and burned up the sacrifice,
so Solomon also prayed, and the fire from above consumed the burnt offerings.

2Ma 2:1 1 Moses had said, ‘Because the sacrifice for sin had not been eaten, it was burnt instead’.

2Ma 2:12 Solomon similarly observed the eight-day festival.



2Ma 2:13 “In addition to the above, it was also recorded, both in these writings and in the Memoirs of Nehemiah,
how Nehemiah founded a library and made a collection of the books dealing with the kings and the prophets, the
writings of David and the letters of the kings on the subject of offerings.

2Ma 2:14 Similarly, Judas made a complete collection of the books dispersed in the late war, and these we still
have.

2Ma 2:15 If you need any of them, send someöne to fetch them.

2Ma 2:16 “Since we are about to celebrate the purification, we now write, requesting you to observe the same
days.

2Ma 2:17 God, who has saved his whole people, conferring heritage, kingdom, priesthood and sanctification on
all of us,

2Ma 2:18 as he has promised in the Law, will surely, as our hope is in him, be swift to show us mercy and
gather us together from everywhere under heaven to the holy place, since he has rescued us from great evils
and has purified it”.

2Ma 2:19 The story of Judas Maccabaeus and his brothers, the purification of the great Temple, the dedication
of the altar,

2Ma 2:20 together with the wars against Antiochus Epiphanes and his son Eupator,

2Ma 2:21 and the celestial manifestations that came to hearten the brave champions of Judaism, so that, few
though they were, they pillaged the whole country, routed the barbarian hordes,

2Ma 2:22 recovered the sanctuary renowned the whole world over, liberated the city and reëstablished the laws
by then all but abolished, the Lord showing his favour by all his gracious help to them-

2Ma 2:23 all this, already related in five books by Jason of Cyrene, we shall attempt to condense into a single
work.

2Ma 2:24 Considering the spate of figures and the difficulty encountered, because of the mass of material, by
those who wish to immerse themselves in historical records,

2Ma 2:25 we have aimed at providing diversion for those who merely want something to read, a saving of labour
for those who enjoy committing things to memory, and profit for each and all.

2Ma 2:26 For us who have undertaken the drudgery of this abridgement, it has been no easy task but a matter
of sweat and midnight oil,

2Ma 2:27 comparable to the exacting task of someöne organising a banquet, whose aim is to satisfy a variety of
tastes. Nevertheless, for the sake of rendering a general service, we remain glad to endure this drudgery,

2Ma 2:28 leaving accuracy of detail to the historian, and concentrating our effort on tracing the outlines in this
condensed version.

2Ma 2:29 Just as the architect of a new house is responsible for the construction as a whole, while the man
undertaking the ceramic painting has to take into consideration only the decorative requirements, so, I think, it is
with us.

2Ma 2:30 To make the subject his own, to explore its by-ways, to be meticulous about details, is the business of
the original historian,

2Ma 2:31 but the person making the adaptation must be allowed to aim at conciseness of expression and to
forgo any exhaustive treatment of his subject.

2Ma 2:32 So now let us begin our narrative, without adding any more to what has been said above; there would
be no sense in expanding the preface to the history and curtailing the history itself.

2Ma 3:1 While the holy city was inhabited in all peace and the laws were observed as perfectly as possible,
owing to the piety of Onias the high priest and his hatred of wickedness,

2Ma 3:2 it came about that the kings themselves honoured the holy place and enhanced the glory of the Temple
with the most splendid offerings,

2Ma 3:3 even to the extent that Seleucus king of Asia defrayed from his own revenues all the expenses arising
out of the sacrificial liturgy.

2Ma 3:4 But a certain Simon, of the tribe of Bilgah, on being appointed administrator of the Temple, came into
conflict with the high priest over the regulation of the city markets.

2Ma 3:5 Unable to get the better of Onias, he went off to Apollonius, son of Thraseos, who was at that time
commander-in-chief of Coele-Syria and Phoenicia,

2Ma 3:6 and made out to him that the Treasury in Jerusalem was groaning with untold wealth, that the amount
contributed was incalculable and out of all proportion to expenditure on the sacrifice, but that it could all be
brought under the control of the king.

2Ma 3:7 Apollonius met the king and told him about the wealth that had been disclosed to him; whereüpon the
king selected Heliodorus, his chancellor, and sent him with instructions to effect the removal of the reported
wealth.

2Ma 3:8 Heliodorus lost no time in setting out, ostensibly to inspect the towns of Coele-Syria and Phoenicia, but
in fact to accomplish the king’s purpose.



2Ma 3:9 On his arrival in Jerusalem, and after a hospitable reception from the high priest and the city, he
announced what had been disclosed, thus revealing the reason for his presence, and asked if this was indeed
the true situation.

2Ma 3:10 The high priest explained that there were funds set aside for widows and orphans,

2Ma 3:11 with some belonging to Hyrcanus son of Tobias, a man occupying a very exalted position, and that
the whole sum, in contrast to what the evil Simon had alleged, amounted to four hundred talants of silver and
two hundred of gold.

2Ma 3:12 He also added that it was entirely out of the question that an injustice should be done to those who
had put their trust in the sanctity of the place and in the inviolable majesty of a Temple venerated throughout the
entire world.

2Ma 3:13 But Heliodorus, because of his instructions from the king, peremptorily insisted that the funds must be
confiscated for the royal exchequer.

2Ma 3:14 Fixing a day for the purpose, he went in to draw up an inventory of the funds. There was no little
consternation throughout the city;

2Ma 3:15 the priests in their sacred vestments prostrated themselves before the altar and prayed to Heaven, to
the Author of the law governing deposits, to preserve these funds intact for the depositors.

2Ma 3:16 The appearance of the high priest was enough to pierce the heart of the beholder, his expression and
his altered colour betraying the anguish of his soul;

2Ma 3:17 the man was so overwhelmed by fear and bodily trembling that those who saw him could not possibly
mistake the distress he was suffering.

2Ma 3:18 People rushed headlong from the houses, intent on making public supplication because of the
indignity threatening the holy place.

2Ma 3:19 Women thronged the streets swathed in sackcloth below their breasts; girls secluded indoors came
running, some to the doorways, some to the city walls, while others leaned out of the windows,

2Ma 3:20 all stretching out their hands to Heaven in entreaty.

2Ma 3:21 It was pitiful to see the people crowding together to prostrate themselves, and the foreboding of the
high priest in his deep anguish.

2Ma 3:22 While they were calling on the all-powerful Lord to preserve the deposits intact for the depositors, in
full security,

2Ma 3:23 Heliodorus set about his appointed task.

2Ma 3:24 He had already arrived with his bodyguard near the Treasury, when the Sovereign of spirits and of
every power caused so great an apparition that all who had dared to accompany Heliodorus were dumbfounded
at the power of God and reduced to abject terror.

2Ma 3:25 Before their eyes appeared a horse richly caparisoned and carrying a fearsome rider. Rearing
violently, it struck at Heliodorus with its forefeet. The rider was seen to be accoutred entirely in gold.

2Ma 3:26 Two other young men of outstanding strength and radiant beauty, magnificently apparelled, appeared
to him at the same time and, taking their stand on each side of him, flogged him unremittingly, inflicting stroke
after stroke.

2Ma 3:27 Suddenly Heliodorus fell to the ground, enveloped in thick darkness. His men came to his rescue and
placed him in a litter,

2Ma 3:28 this man who but a moment before had made his way into the Treasury, as we said above, with a
great retinue and his whole bodyguard; and as they carried him away, powerless to help himself, they openly
acknowledged the sovereign power of God.

2Ma 3:29 While Heliodorus lay prostrate under the divine visitation, speechless and bereft of all hope of
deliverance,

2Ma 3:30 the Jews blessed the Lord who had miraculously glorified his own holy place. And the Temple, which
a little while before had been filled with terror and commotion, now overflowed with joy and gladness at the
manifestation of the almighty Lord.

2Ma 3:31 Some of Heliodorus’ companions quickly begged Onias to entreat the Most High to grant the man his
life, lying as he did at the very point of death.

2Ma 3:32 The high priest, afraid that the king might suspect the Jews of some foul play concerning Heliodorus,
did indeed offer a sacrifice for the man’s recovery.

2Ma 3:33 And while the high priest was performing the rite of expiation, the same young men again appeared to
Heliodorus, wearing the same apparel and, standing beside him, said, “Be very grateful to Onias the high priest,
since it is for his sake that the Lord has granted you your life.

2Ma 3:34 As for you, who have been scourged by Heaven, you must proclaim to everyone the grandeur of
God’s power”. So saying, they vanished.

2Ma 3:35 Heliodorus offered sacrifice to the Lord and made most solemn vows to the preserver of his life, and
then took courteous leave of Onias and marched his forces back to the king.



2Ma 3:36 He openly testified to everyone about the works of the supreme God which he had seen with his own
eyes.

2Ma 3:37 When the king asked Heliodorus what sort of man would be the right person to send to Jerusalem on
a second occasion, he replied,

2Ma 3:38 “If you have some enemy or anyone disloyal to the state, send him there, and you will get him back
well flogged, if he survives at all, since some peculiarly divine power attaches to the holy place.

2Ma 3:39 He who has his dwelling in heaven watches over the place and defends it, and he strikes down and
destroys those who come to harm it”.

2Ma 3:40 This was the outcome of the affair of Heliodorus and the preservation of the Treasury.

2Ma 4:1 The Simon mentioned above as the informer against the funds and against his country began
slandering Onias, insinuating that the latter had been responsible for the assault on Heliodorus and himself had
contrived this misfortune.

2Ma 4:2 Simon now had the effrontery to name this benefactor of the city, this protector of his compatriots, this
zealot for the laws, as an enemy of the public good.

2Ma 4:3 This hostility reached such proportions that murders were actually committed by some of Simon’s
agents,

2Ma 4:4 and at this point Onias, recognising how mischievous this rivalry was, and aware that Apollonius son of
Menestheus, the general commanding Coele-Syria and Phoenicia, was encouraging Simon in his malice,

2Ma 4:5 went to see the king, not to play the accuser of his fellow-citizens, but having the public and private
welfare of the entire people at heart.

2Ma 4:6 He saw that, without some intervention by the king, an orderly administration would no longer be
possible, nor would Simon put a stop to his folly.

2Ma 4:7 When Seleucus had departed this life and Antiochus styled Epiphanes had succeeded to the kingdom,
Jason, brother of Onias, usurped the high priesthood:

2Ma 4:8 he approached the king with a promise of three hundred and sixty talants of silver, with eighty talants to
come from some other source of revenue.

2Ma 4:9 He further committed himself to paying another hundred and fifty, if the king would empower him to set
up a gymnasium and youth centre, and to register the Antiochists of Jerusalem.

2Ma 4:10 When the king gave his assent, Jason, as soon as he had seized power, imposed the Greek way of
life on his fellow-countrymen.

2Ma 4:1 1 He suppressed the liberties which the kings had graciously granted to the Jews at the instance of
John, father of that Eupolemus who was later to be sent on an embassy to negotiate a treaty of friendship and
alliance with the Romans and, overthrowing the lawful institutions, introduced new usages contrary to the Law.
2Ma 4:12 He went so far as to found a gymnasium at the very foot of the Citadel, and to fit out the noblest of his
young men in the petasos.

2Ma 4:13 Godless wretch that he was and no true high priest, Jason set no bounds to his impiety; indeed the
hellenising process reached such a pitch

2Ma 4:14 that the priests ceased to show any interest in serving the altar; but, scorning the Temple and
neglecting the sacrifices, they would hurry, on the stroke of the gong, to take part in the distribution, forbidden by
the Law, of the oil on the exercise ground;

2Ma 4:15 setting no store by the honours of their fatherland, they esteemed hellenic glories best of all.

2Ma 4:16 But all this brought its own retribution; the very people whose way of life they envied, whom they
sought to resemble in everything, proved to be their enemies and executioners.

2Ma 4:17 It is no small thing to violate the divine laws, as the period that followed will demonstrate.

2Ma 4:18 On the occasion of the quadrennial games at Tyre in the presence of the king,

2Ma 4:19 the vile Jason sent an embassy of Antiochists from Jerusalem, taking with them three hundred silver
drachmas for the sacrifice to Hercules. But even those who brought the money did not think it would be right to
spend it on the sacrifice and decided to reserve it for some other item of expenditure;

2Ma 4:20 and so what the sender had intended for the sacrifice to Hercules was in fact applied, at the
suggestion of those who brought it, to the construction of triremes.

2Ma 4:21 Apollonius son of Menestheus had been sent to Egypt to attend the wedding of King Philometor.
Antiochus, having learnt that the latter had become hostile to his affairs, began thinking about his own safety:
that was why he had come to Joppa. He then moved to Jerusalem,

2Ma 4:22 where he was given a magnificent welcome by Jason and the city, and escorted in by torchlight with
acclamation. After which, he marched his army into Phoenicia.

2Ma 4:23 When three years had passed, Jason sent Menelaus, brother of the Simon mentioned above, to
convey the money to the king and to complete negotiations on various essential matters.

2Ma 4:24 But Menelaus, on being presented to the king, flattered him by his own appearance of authority, and
so secured the high priesthood for himself, outbidding Jason by three hundred talants of silver.



2Ma 4:25 He returned with the royal mandate, bringing nothing worthy of the high priesthood and supported
only by the fury of a cruel tyrant and the rage of a savage beast.

2Ma 4:26 Thus Jason, who had supplanted his own brother, was in turn supplanted by a third, and obliged to
take refuge in Ammanitis.

2Ma 4:27 As for Menelaus, he secured the office, but defaulted altogether on the sums promised to the king,
2Ma 4:28 although Sostratus, the commandant of the Citadel, whose business it was to collect the revenue,
kept demanding payment. The pair of them in consequence were summoned before the king,

2Ma 4:29 Menelaus leaving his brother Lysimachus as deputy high priest, while Sostratus left Crates, the
commander of the Cypriots, to act for him.

2Ma 4:30 While all this was going on, it happened that the people of Tarsus and Mallus revolted, because their
towns had been given as a present to Antiochis, the king’s concubine.

2Ma 4:31 The king therefore hurried off to settle the affair, leaving Andronicus, one of his dignitaries, to act as
his deputy.

2Ma 4:32 Thinking he had found a favourable opportunity, Menelaus abstracted a number of golden vessels
from the Temple and presented them to Andronicus, and managed to sell others to Tyre and the surrounding
cities.

2Ma 4:33 On receiving clear evidence to this effect, Onias retired to a place of sanctuary at Daphne near
Antioch and then taxed him with it.

2Ma 4:34 Menelaus then had a quiet word with Andronicus, urging him to get rid of Onias. Andronicus sought
out Onias and, resorting to the trick of offering him his right hand on oath, succeeded in persuading him, despite
the latter’s lingering suspicions, to leave sanctuary; whereüpon, in defiance of all justice, he immediately put him
to death.

2Ma 4:35 The result was that not only Jews but many people of other nationalities were appalled and outraged
by the unjust murder of this man.

2Ma 4:36 On the king’s return from the region of Cilicia, the Jews of the capital, and those Greeks who shared
their hatred of the crime, appealed to him about the unjustified murder of Onias.

2Ma 4:37 Antiochus was profoundly grieved and filled with pity, and he wept for the prudence and moderation of
the dead man.

2Ma 4:38 Burning with indignation, he immediately stripped Andronicus of the purple, tore his garments off him
and, parading him through the length of the city, rid the world of the assassin on the very spot where he had laid
impious hands on Onias, the Lord dealing out to him the punishment he deserved.

2Ma 4:39 Now Lysimachus with the connivance of Menelaus had committed many sacrilegious thefts in the city,
and when the facts became widely known, the populace rose against Lysimachus, who had already disposed of
many pieces of gold plate.

2Ma 4:40 The infuriated mob was becoming menacing, and Lysimachus armed nearly three thousand men and
took aggressive action; the troops were led by a certain Auranus, a man advanced in years and no less in folly.
2Ma 4:41 Recognising this act of aggression as the work of Lysimachus, some snatched up stones, others
cudgels, while others scooped up handfuls of ashes lying at hand, and all hurled everything indiscriminately at
Lysimachus’ men,

2Ma 4:42 to such effect that they wounded many of them, even killing a few, and routed them all; the
sacrilegious thief himself they killed near the Treasury.

2Ma 4:43 As a result of this, legal proceedings were taken against Menelaus.

2Ma 4:44 When the king came down to Tyre, three men deputed by the Senate pleaded their case before him.
2Ma 4:45 Menelaus, seeing the case had gone against him, promised a substantial sum to Ptolemy son of
Dorymenes if he would influence the king in his favour.

2Ma 4:46 Ptolemy then took the king aside into a colonnade, as though for a breath of fresh air, and persuaded
him to change his mind;

2Ma 4:47 the king then dismissed the charges against Menelaus, the cause of all this evil, while he condemned
to death the other poor wretches who, had they pleaded even before Scythians, would have been let off scot-
free.

2Ma 4:48 No time was lost in carrying out this unjust punishment on those who had championed the cause of
the city, the townships and the sacred vessels.

2Ma 4:49 Some Tyrians even were so outraged by the crime that they provided sumptuously for their funeral,
2Ma 4:50 while, as a result of the greed of the powerful, Menelaus remained in power, growing more wicked
than ever and establishing himself as the chief enemy of his fellow-citizens.

2Ma 5:1 At about this time, Antiochus was preparing for his second attack on Egypt.

2Ma 5:2 It then happened that all over the city for nearly forty days there were apparitions of horsemen
galloping through the air in cloth of gold, troops of lancers fully armed,

2Ma 5:3 squadrons of cavalry in order of battle, attacks and charges this way and that, a flourish of shields, a



forest of pikes, a brandishing of swords, a hurling of missiles, a glittering of golden accoutrements and armour of
all kinds.

2Ma 5:4 So everyone prayed that this manifestation might prove a good omen.

2Ma 5:5 Then, on the strength of a false report that Antiochus was dead, Jason took at least a thousand men
and launched an unexpected attack on the city. When the walls had been breached and the city was finally on
the point of being taken, Menelaus took refuge in the Citadel.

2Ma 5:6 Jason, however, made a pitiless slaughter of his fellow-citizens, oblivious of the fact that success
against his own countrymen was the greatest of disasters, but rather picturing himself as winning trophies from
some enemy, and not from his fellow- countrymen.

2Ma 5:7 Even so, he did not manage to seize power; and, in the end, his machinations brought him nothing but
shame, and he took refuge once more in Ammanitis.

2Ma 5:8 His career of wickedness was thus brought to a halt: imprisoned by Aretas, the Arab despot, escaping
from his town, hunted by everyone, detested for having overthrown the laws, abhorred as the butcher of his
country and his countrymen, he drifted to Egypt.

2Ma 5:9 He who had exiled so many from their fatherland, himself perished on foreign soil, having travelled to
Sparta, hoping that, for kinship’s sake, he might find harbour there.

2Ma 5:10 So many carcases he had thrust out to lie unburied; now he himself had none to mourn him, no
funeral rites, no place in the tomb of his ancestors.

2Ma 5:1 1 When the king came to hear of what had happened, he concluded that Judaea was in revolt. He
therefore marched from Egypt, raging like a wild beast, and began by storming the city.

2Ma 5:12 He then ordered his soldiers to cut down without mercy everyone they encountered, and to butcher all
who took refuge in their houses.

2Ma 5:13 It was a massacre of young and old, a slaughter of women and children, a butchery of young girls and
infants.

2Ma 5:14 There were eighty thousand victims in the course of those three days, forty thousand dying by
violence and as many again being sold into slavery.

2Ma 5:15 Not content with this, he had the audacity to enter the holiest Temple in the entire world, with
Menelaus, that traitor to the laws and to his country, as his guide;

2Ma 5:16 with impure hands he seized the sacred vessels; with impious hands he seized the offerings
presented by other kings for the aggrandisement, glory and dignity of the holy place.

2Ma 5:17 Holding so high an opinion of himself, Antiochus did not realise that the Lord was temporarily angry at
the sins of the inhabitants of the city, hence his unconcern for the holy place.

2Ma 5:18 Had they not been entangled in many sins, Antiochus too, like Heliodorus when King Seleucus sent
him to inspect the Treasury, would have been flogged the moment he arrived and checked in his presumption.
2Ma 5:19 The Lord, however, had not chosen the people for the sake of the holy place, but the holy place for
the sake of the people;

2Ma 5:20 and so the holy place itself, having shared the disasters that befell the people, in due course also
shared their good fortune; having been abandoned by the Almighty in his anger, once the great Sovereign was
placated it was reinstated in all its glory.

2Ma 5:21 Antiochus, having extracted eighteen hundred talants from the Temple, hurried back to Antioch; in his
pride he would have undertaken to make the dry land navigable and the sea passable on foot, so high his
arrogance soared.

2Ma 5:22 But he left officials behind to plague the nation: in Jerusalem, Philip, a Phrygian by race, and by
nature more barbarous than the man who appointed him;

2Ma 5:23 on Mount Gerizim, Andronicus; and, besides these, Menelaus, who lorded it over his countrymen
worse than all the others. In his rooted hostility to the Jews,

2Ma 5:24 the king also sent the Mysarch Apollonius at the head of an army twenty-two thousand strong, with
orders to put to death all men in their prime and to sell the women and children.

2Ma 5:25 Arriving in Jerusalem and posing as a man of peace, this man waited until the holy day of the Sabbath
and then, taking advantage of the Jews as they rested from work, ordered his men to parade fully armed;

2Ma 5:26 all those who came out to watch he put to the sword; then, rushing into the city with his armed troops,
he cut down an immense number of people.

2Ma 5:27 Judas, also known as Maccabaeus, however, with about nine others, withdrew into the desert. He
lived like the wild animals in the hills with his companions, eating nothing but wild plants to avoid contracting
defilement.

2Ma 6:1 Shortly afterwards, the king sent Gerontes the Athenian to force the Jews to violate their ancestral
customs and live no longer by the laws of God;

2Ma 6:2 and to profane the Temple in Jerusalem and dedicate it to Olympian Zeus, and the one on Mount
Gerizim to Zeus, Patron of Strangers, as the inhabitants of the latter place had requested.



2Ma 6:3 The advent of these evils was painfully hard for all the people to bear.

2Ma 6:4 The Temple was filled with revelling and debauchery by the gentiles, who took their pleasure with
prostitutes and had intercourse with women in the sacred precincts, introducing other indecencies besides.

2Ma 6:5 The altar of sacrifice was loaded with victims proscribed by the law as profane.

2Ma 6:6 No one might either keep the Sabbath or observe the traditional feasts, or so much as admit to being a
Jew.

2Ma 6:7 People were driven by harsh compulsion to take part in the monthly ritual meal commemorating the
king’s birthday; and when a feast of Dionysus occurred, they were forced to wear ivy wreaths and walk in the
Dionysiac procession.

2Ma 6:8 A decree was issued at the instance of the people of Ptolemais for the neighbouring Greek cities,
enforcing the same conduct on the Jews there, obliging them to share in the sacrificial meals,

2Ma 6:9 and ordering the execution of those who would not voluntarily conform to Greek customs. So it became
clear that disaster was imminent.

2Ma 6:10 For example, two women were charged with having circumcised their children. They were paraded
publicly round the town, with their babies hung at their breasts, and then hurled over the city wall.

2Ma 6:1 1 Other people, who had assembled in some near-by caves to keep the seventh day without attracting
attention, were denounced to Philip, and were then all burnt to death together, since their consciences would not
allow them to defend themselves, out of respect for the holiness of the day.

2Ma 6:12 Now, I urge anyone who may read this book not to be dismayed at these calamities, but to reflect that
such visitations are intended not to destroy our race but to discipline it.

2Ma 6:13 Indeed, when evil-doers are not left for long to their own devices but incur swift retribution, it is a sign
of great benevolence.

2Ma 6:14 In the case of other nations, the Master waits patiently for them to attain the full measure of their sins
before he punishes them, but with us he has decided to deal differently,

2Ma 6:15 rather than have to punish us later, when our sins come to full measure.

2Ma 6:16 And so he never entirely withdraws his mercy from us; he may discipline us by some disaster, but he
does not desert his own people.

2Ma 6:17 Let this be said simply by way of reminder; we must return to our story without more ado.

2Ma 6:18 Eleazar, one of the foremost teachers of the Law, a man already advanced in years and of most noble
appearance, had his mouth forced open, to make him eat a piece of pork.

2Ma 6:19 But he, resolving to die with honour rather than to live disgraced, walked of his own accord to the
torture of the wheel,

2Ma 6:20 having spat the stuff out, as befits those with the courage to reject what is not lawful to taste, rather
than live.

2Ma 6:21 The people supervising the ritual meal, forbidden by the Law, because of the length of time for which
they had known him, took him aside and privately urged him to have meat brought of a kind he could properly
use, prepared by himself, and only pretend to eat the portions of sacrificial meat as prescribed by the king;

2Ma 6:22 this action would enable him to escape death, by availing himself of an act of kindness prompted by
their long friendship.

2Ma 6:23 But having taken a noble decision worthy of his years and the dignity of his great age and the well-
earned distinction of his grey hairs, worthy too of his impeccable conduct from boyhood, and above all of the
holy legislation established by God himself, he answered accordingly, telling them to send him at once to Hades.
2Ma 6:24 “Pretence”, he said, “does not befit our time of life; many young people would suppose that Eleazar at
the age of ninety had conformed to the foreigners’ way of life

2Ma 6:25 and, because I had played this part for the sake of a paltry brief spell of life, might themselves be led
astray on my account; I should only bring defilement and disgrace on my old age.

2Ma 6:26 Even though for the moment I avoid execution by man, I can never, living or dead, elude the grasp of
the Almighty.

2Ma 6:27 Therefore if I am man enough to quit this life here and now, I shall prove myself worthy of my old age,
2Ma 6:28 and I shall have left the young a noble example of how to make a good death, eagerly and
generously, for the venerable and holy laws”. So saying, he walked straight to the wheel,

2Ma 6:29 while those who were escorting him, recently so well disposed towards him, turned against him after
this declaration, which they regarded as sheer madness.

2Ma 6:30 He for his part, just before he died under the blows, gave a sigh and said, “The Lord whose knowledge
is holy sees clearly that, though I might have escaped death, from awe of him I gladly endure these agonies of
body under the lash, and that in my soul I am glad to suffer”.

2Ma 6:31 This was how he died, leaving his death as an example of nobility and a record of virtue not only for
the young but for the greater part of the nation.

2Ma 7:1 It also happened that seven brothers were arrested with their mother. The king tried to force them to



taste some pork, which the Law forbids, by torturing them with whips and scourges.

2Ma 7:2 One of them, acting as spokesman for the others, said, “What are you trying to find out from us? We
are prepared to die rather than break the laws of our ancestors”.

2Ma 7:3 The king, in a fury, ordered pans and cauldrons to be heated over a fire.

2Ma 7:4 As soon as these were red-hot, he commanded that their spokesman should have his tongue cut out,
his head scalped and his extremities cut off, while the other brothers and his mother looked on.

2Ma 7:5 When he had been rendered completely helpless, the king gave orders for him to be brought, still
breathing, to the fire and fried alive in a pan. As the smoke from the pan drifted about, his mother and the rest
encouraged one another to die nobly, with such words as these,

2Ma 7:6 “The Lord God is watching and certainly feels sorry for us, as Moses declared in his song, which clearly
states that ‘he will take pity on his servants’”.

2Ma 7:7 When the first had left the world in this way, they brought the second forward to be tortured. After
stripping the skin from his head, hair and all, they asked him, “Will you eat some pork, before your body is
tortured limb by limb?”.

2Ma 7:8 Replying in his ancestral tongue, he said, “No!”. So he too was put to the torture in his turn.

2Ma 7:9 With his last breath he exclaimed, “Cruel brute, you may discharge us from this present life, but the
King of the world will raise us up, since we die for his laws, to live again for ever”.

2Ma 7:10 After him, they tortured the third, who on being asked for his tongue promptly thrust it out and boldly
held out his hands,

2Ma 7:1 1 courageously saying, “Heaven gave me these limbs; for the sake of his laws I have no concern for
them; from him I hope to receive them again”.

2Ma 7:12 The king and his attendants were astounded at the young man’s courage and his utter indifference to
suffering.

2Ma 7:13 When this one was dead they subjected the fourth to the same torments and tortures.

2Ma 7:14 When he neared his end he cried, “Ours is the better choice, to meet death at men’s hands, yet relying
on God’s promise that we shall be raised up by him; whereäs for you there can be no resurrection to new life”.
2Ma 7:15 Next they brought forward the fifth and began torturing him.

2Ma 7:16 But he looked at the king and said, “You have power over human beings, mortal as you are, and can
act as you please. But do not think that our race has been deserted by God.

2Ma 7:17 Only wait, and you will see in your turn how his mighty power will torment you and your descendants”.
2Ma 7:18 After him, they led out the sixth, and his dying words were these, “Do not delude yourself: we are
suffering like this through our own fault, having sinned against our own God; hence, appalling things have
befallen us-

2Ma 7:19 but do not think you yourself will go unpunished for attempting to make war on God”.

2Ma 7:20 But the mother was especially admirable and worthy of honourable remembrance, for she watched
the death of seven sons in the course of a single day, and bravely endured it because of her hopes in the Lord.
2Ma 7:21 Indeed she encouraged each of them in their ancestral tongue; filled with noble conviction, she
reïnforced her womanly argument with manly courage, saying to them,

2Ma 7:22 “I do not know how you appeared in my womb; it was not I who endowed you with breath and life, I
had not the shaping of your every part.

2Ma 7:23 And hence, the Creator of the world, who made everyone and ordained the origin of all things, will in
his mercy give you back breath and life, since for the sake of his laws you have no concern for yourselves”.

2Ma 7:24 Antiochus thought he was being ridiculed, suspecting insult in the tone of her voice; and as the
youngest was still alive he appealed to him not with mere words but with promises on oath to make him both rich
and happy if he would abandon the traditions of his ancestors; he would make him his Friend and entrust him
with public office.

2Ma 7:25 The young man took no notice at all, and so the king then appealed to the mother, urging her to
advise the youth to save his life.

2Ma 7:26 After a great deal of urging on his part she agreed to try persuasion on her son.

2Ma 7:27 Bending over him, she fooled the cruel tyrant with these words, uttered in their ancestral tongue, “My
son, have pity on me; I carried you nine months in my womb and suckled you three years, fed you and reared
you to the age you are now, and provided for you.

2Ma 7:28 I implore you, my child, look at the earth and sky and everything in them, and consider how God made
them out of what did not exist, and that human beings come into being in the same way.

2Ma 7:29 Do not fear this executioner, but prove yourself worthy of your brothers and accept death, so that I
may receive you back with them in the day of mercy”.

2Ma 7:30 She had hardly finished, when the young man said, “What are you all waiting for? I will not comply
with the king’s ordinance; I obey the ordinance of the Law given to our ancestors through Moses.

2Ma 7:31 As for you, who have contrived every kind of evil against the Hebrews, you will certainly not escape



the hands of God.

2Ma 7:32 We are suffering for our own sins;

2Ma 7:33 and if, to punish and discipline us, our living Lord is briefly angry with us, he will be reconciled with us
in due course.

2Ma 7:34 But you, unholy wretch and wickedest of villains, what cause have you for pride, nourishing vain
hopes and raising your hand against his servants? -

2Ma 7:35 for you have not yet escaped the judgement of God the almighty, the all-seeing.

2Ma 7:36 Our brothers, having endured brief pain, for the sake of ever-flowing life have died for the covenant of
God, while you, by God’s judgement, will have to pay the just penalty for your arrogance.

2Ma 7:37 I too, like my brothers, surrender my body and life for the laws of my ancestors, begging God quickly
to take pity on our nation, and by trials and afflictions to bring you to confess that he alone is God,

2Ma 7:38 so that with my brothers and myself there may be an end to the wrath of the Almighty, rightly let loose
on our whole nation”.

2Ma 7:39 The king fell into a rage and treated this one more cruelly than the others, for he was himself smarting
from the young man’s scorn.

2Ma 7:40 And so the last brother met his end undefiled and with perfect trust in the Lord.

2Ma 7:41 The mother was the last to die, after her sons.

2Ma 7:42 But let this be sufficient account of the ritual meals and monstrous tortures.

2Ma 8:1 Judas, otherwise known as Maccabaeus, and his companions made their way secretly among the
villages, rallying their fellow-countrymen; they recruited those who remained loyal to Judaism and assembled
about six thousand.

2Ma 8:2 They called on the Lord to have regard for the people oppressed on all sides, to take pity on the
Temple profaned by the godless,

2Ma 8:3 to have mercy on the city now being destroyed and levelled to the ground, to hear the blood of the
victims that cried aloud to him,

2Ma 8:4 to remember too the criminal slaughter of innocent babies and to avenge the blasphemies perpetrated
against his name.

2Ma 8:5 As soon as Maccabaeus had an organised force, he at once proved invincible to the foreigners, the
Lord’s anger having turned into compassion.

2Ma 8:6 Making surprise attacks on towns and villages, he fired them; he captured favourable positions and
inflicted very heavy losses on the enemy,

2Ma 8:7 generally availing himself of the cover of night for such enterprises. The fame of his valour spread far
and wide.

2Ma 8:8 When Philip saw Judas was making steady progress and winning more and more frequent successes,
he wrote to Ptolemy, the general officer commanding Coele-Syria and Phoenicia, asking for reinforcements in
the royal interest.

2Ma 8:9 Ptolemy chose Nicanor son of Patroclus, one of the king’s First Friends, and sent him without delay at
the head of an international force of at least twenty thousand men to exterminate the entire Jewish race. As his
associate he appointed Gorgias, a professional general of wide military experience.

2Ma 8:10 Nicanor for his part proposed, by the sale of Jewish prisoners of war, to raise the two thousand talants
of tribute money owed by the king to the Romans.

2Ma 8:1 1 He lost no time in sending the seaboard towns an invitation to come and buy Jewish manpower,
promising delivery of ninety head for one talant; but he did not reckon on the judgement from the Almighty that
was soon to overtake him.

2Ma 8:12 When news reached Judas of Nicanor’s advance, he warned his men of the enemy’s approach,

2Ma 8:13 whereüpon the cowardly ones and those who lacked confidence in the justice of God took to their
heels and ran away.

2Ma 8:14 The rest sold all their remaining possessions, at the same time praying the Lord to deliver them from
the godless Nicanor, who had sold them even in advance of any encounter-

2Ma 8:15 if not for their own sakes, then at least out of consideration for the covenants made with their
ancestors, and because they themselves bore his sacred and majestic name.

2Ma 8:16 Maccabaeus marshalled his men, who numbered about six thousand, and exhorted them not to be
dismayed at the enemy or discouraged at the vast horde of gentiles wickedly advancing against them, but to
fight bravely,

2Ma 8:17 keeping before their eyes the outrage committed by them against the holy place and the infamous and
scornful treatment inflicted on the city, not to mention the destruction of their traditional way of life.

2Ma 8:18 “They may put their trust in their weapons and their exploits”, he said, “but our confidence is in almighty
God, who is able with a single nod to overthrow both those marching on us and the whole world with them”.

2Ma 8:19 He reminded them of the occasions on which their ancestors had received help: that time when, under



Sennacherib, a hundred and eighty-five thousand men had perished;

2Ma 8:20 that time in Babylonia when in the battle with the Galatians the Jewish combatants numbered only
eight thousand, with four thousand Macedonians, yet when the Macedonians were hard pressed, the eight
thousand had destroyed a hundred and twenty thousand, thanks to the help they had received from Heaven, and
had taken great booty as a result.

2Ma 8:21 Having so roused their courage by these words that they were ready to die for the laws and their
country, he then divided his army into four,

2Ma 8:22 putting his brothers, Simon, Joseph and Jonathan in command of one division each, and assigning
them fifteen hundred men apiece.

2Ma 8:23 Next, he ordered Esdrias to read the Holy Book aloud and gave them their watchword ‘Help from
God’. Then, putting himself at the head of the first division, he attacked Nicanor.

2Ma 8:24 With the Almighty for their ally they slaughtered over nine thousand of the enemy, wounded and
crippled the greater part of Nicanor’s army and put them all to flight.

2Ma 8:25 The money of their prospective purchasers fell into their hands. After pursuing them for a good while,
they turned back, since time was pressing:

2Ma 8:26 it was the eve of the Sabbath, and for that reason they did not prolong their pursuit.

2Ma 8:27 They collected the enemy’s weapons and stripped them of their spoils, and because of the Sabbath
even more heartily blessed and praised the Lord, who had saved them and who had chosen that day for the first
manifestation of his compassion.

2Ma 8:28 When the Sabbath was over, they distributed some of the booty among the victims of the persecution
and the widows and orphans; the rest they divided among themselves and their children.

2Ma 8:29 They then joined in public supplication, imploring the merciful Lord to be fully reconciled with his
servants.

2Ma 8:30 They also challenged the forces of Timotheus and Bacchides and destroyed over twenty thousand of
them, gaining possession of several high fortresses. They divided their enormous booty into two equal shares,
one for themselves, the other for the victims of the persecution and the orphans and widows, not forgetting the
aged.

2Ma 8:31 They carefully collected the enemy’s weapons and stored them in suitable places. The rest of the
spoils they took to Jerusalem.

2Ma 8:32 They killed the tribal chieftain on Timotheus’ staff, an extremely wicked man who had done great harm
to the Jews.

2Ma 8:33 In the course of their victory celebrations in Jerusalem, they burned the men who had fired the Holy
Gates; with Callisthenes they had taken refuge in one small house; so these received a fitting reward for their
sacrilege.

2Ma 8:34 The triple-dyed scoundrel Nicanor, who had brought the thousand merchants to buy the Jews,

2Ma 8:35 finding himself with the Lord’s help humbled by men he had himself reckoned as of very little account,
stripped off his robes of state, and made his way across country unaccompanied, like a runaway slave, reaching
Antioch by a singular stroke of fortune, since his army had been destroyed.

2Ma 8:36 Thus the man who had promised the Romans to make good their tribute money by selling the
prisoners from Jerusalem, bore witness that the Jews had a defender and that they were in consequence
invulnerable, since they followed the laws which that defender had ordained.

2Ma 9:1 At about the same time, Antiochus was beating a disorderly retreat from Persia.

2Ma 9:2 He had entered the city called Persepolis, planning to rob the temple and occupy the city; but the
population at once sprang to arms to defend themselves, with the result that Antiochus was routed by the
inhabitants and forced to beat a humiliating retreat.

2Ma 9:3 On his arrival in Ecbatana he learned what had happened to Nicanor and to Timotheus’ forces.

2Ma 9:4 Flying into a passion, he resolved to make the Jews pay for the disgrace inflicted by those who had
routed him, and with this in mind he ordered his charioteer to drive without stopping and get the journey over.

But the sentence of Heaven was already hanging over him. In his pride, he had said, “When I reach Jerusalem, I
shall turn it into a mass grave for the Jews”.

2Ma 9:5 But the all-seeing Lord, the God of Israel, struck him with an incurable and unseen complaint. The
words were hardly out of his mouth when he was seized with an incurable pain in his bowels and with
excruciating internal torture;

2Ma 9:6 and this was only right, since he had inflicted many barbaric tortures on the bowels of others.

2Ma 9:7 Even so, he in no way diminished his arrogance; still bursting with pride, breathing fire in his wrath
against the Jews, he was in the act of ordering an even keener pace when the chariot gave a sudden lurch and
out he fell and, in this serious fall, was dragged along, every joint of his body wrenched out of place.

2Ma 9:8 He who only a little while before had thought in his superhuman boastfulness he could command the
waves of the sea, he who had imagined he could weigh mountain peaks in a balance, found himself flat on the



ground and then being carried in a litter, a visible demonstration to all of the power of God,

2Ma 9:9 in that the very eyes of this godless man teemed with worms and his flesh rotted away while he
lingered on in agonising pain, and the stench of his decay sickened the whole army.

2Ma 9:10 A short while before, he had thought to grasp the stars of heaven; now no one could bring himself to
act as his bearer, for the stench was intolerable.

2Ma 9:1 1 Then and there, as a consequence, in his shattered state, he began to shed his excessive pride and
come to his senses under the divine lash, spasms of pain overtaking him.

2Ma 9:12 His stench being unbearable even to himself, he exclaimed, “It is right to submit to God; no mortal
should aspire to equality with the Godhead”.

2Ma 9:13 The wretch began to pray to the Master, who would never take pity on him now, declaring

2Ma 9:14 that the holy city, towards which he had been speeding to rase it to the ground and turn it into a mass

grave, should be declared free;

2Ma 9:15 as for the Jews, whom he had considered as not even worth burying, so much carrion to be thrown
out with their children for birds and beasts to prey on, he would give them all equal rights with the Athenians;

2Ma 9:16 the holy Temple which he had once plundered he would now adorn with the finest offerings; he would
restore all the sacred vessels many times over; he would defray from his personal revenue the expenses
incurred for the sacrifices;

2Ma 9:17 and, to crown all, he would himself turn Jew and visit every inhabited place, proclaiming the power of
God.

2Ma 9:18 Finding no respite at all from his suffering, God’s just sentence having overtaken him, he abandoned
all hope for himself and wrote the Jews the letter transcribed below, which takes the form of an appeal in these
terms:

2Ma 9:19 “To the excellent Jews, to the citizens, Antiochus, king and commander-in-chief, sends hearty
greetings, wishing them all health and prosperity.

2Ma 9:20 “If you and your children are well and your affairs as you would wish, we are profoundly thankful.

2Ma 9:21 For my part, I cherish affectionate memories of you. “On my return from the country of Persia I fell
seriously ill, and thought it necessary to make provision for the common security of all.

2Ma 9:22 Not that I despair of my condition, for I have great hope of shaking off the malady,

2Ma 9:23 but considering how my father, whenever he was making an expedition into the uplands, would
designate his successor

2Ma 9:24 so that, in case of any unforeseen event or disquieting rumour, the people of the provinces might
know to whom he had left the conduct of affairs, and thus remain undisturbed;

2Ma 9:25 furthermore, being well aware that the sovereigns on our frontiers and the neighbours of our realm are
watching for opportunities and waiting to see what will happen, I have designated as king my son Antiochus,
whom I have more than once entrusted and commended to most of you when I was setting out for the upland
satrapies; a transcript of my letter to him is appended hereto.

2Ma 9:26 I therefore urge and require you, being mindful of the benefits both public and personal received from
me, that you each persist in those sentiments of goodwill that you harbour towards me.

2Ma 9:27 I am confident that he will pursue my own policy with benevolence and humanity, and will prove
accommodating to your interests”.

2Ma 9:28 And so this murderer and blasphemer, having endured sufferings as terrible as those which he had
made others endure, met his pitiable fate, and ended his life in the mountains far from his home.

2Ma 9:29 His comrade Philip brought back his body, and then, fearing Antiochus’ son, withdrew to Egypt, to the
court of Ptolemy Philometor.

2Ma 10:1 Maccabaeus and his companions, under the Lord’s guidance, restored the Temple and the city,

2Ma 10:2 and pulled down the altars erected by the foreigners in the market place, as well as the shrines.

2Ma 10:3 They purified the sanctuary and built another altar; then, striking fire from flints and using this fire, they
offered the first sacrifice for two years, burning incense, lighting the lamps and setting out the loaves.

2Ma 10:4 When they had done this, prostrating themselves on the ground, they implored the Lord never again
to let them fall into such adversity, but if they should ever sin, to correct them with moderation and not to deliver
them over to blasphemous and barbarous nations.

2Ma 10:5 This day of the purification of the Temple fell on the very day on which the Temple had been profaned
by the foreigners, the twenty-fifth of the same month, Chislev.

2Ma 1 0:6 They kept eight festal days with rejoicing, in the manner of the feast of Shelters, remembering how,
not long before at the time of the feast of Shelters, they had been living in the mountains and caverns like wild
beasts.

2Ma 10:7 Then, carrying thyrsuses, leafy boughs and palms, they offered hymns to him who had brought the
cleansing of his own holy place to a happy outcome.

2Ma 10:8 They also decreed by public edict, ratified by vote, that the whole Jewish nation should celebrate



those same days every year.

2Ma 10:9 Such were the circumstances attending the death of Antiochus styled Epiphanes.

2Ma 10:10 Our task now is to unfold the history of Antiochus Eupator, son of that godless man, and briefly to
relate the evil effects of the wars.

2Ma 10:1 1 On coming to the throne, this prince put at the head of affairs a certain Lysias, the general officer
commanding Coele-Syria and Phoenicia,

2Ma 10:12 whereäs Ptolemy, known as Macron, and the first person to govern the Jews justly, had done his
best to govern them peacefully to make up for the wrongs inflicted on them in the past.

2Ma 10:13 Denounced, in consequence, to Eupator by the Friends of the King, he heard himself called traitor at
every turn: for having abandoned Cyprus, which had been entrusted to him by Philometer, for having gone over
to Antiochus Epiphanes, and for having shed no lustre on his illustrious office: he committed suicide by poisoning
himself.

2Ma 10:14 Gorgias now became general of the area; he maintained a force of mercenaries and a continual
state of war with the Jews.

2Ma 10:15 At the same time, the Idumaeans, who controlled important fortresses, were harassing the Jews,
welcoming outlaws from Jerusalem and endeavouring to maintain a state of war.

2Ma 10:16 Maccabaeus and his men, after making public supplication to God, entreating him to support them,
began operations against the Idumaean fortresses.

2Ma 10:17 Vigorously pressing home their attack, they seized possession of these vantage points, beating off
all who fought on the ramparts; they slaughtered all who fell into their hands, accounting for no fewer than twenty
thousand.

2Ma 10:18 Nine thousand at least took refuge in two exceptionally strong towers with everything they needed to
withstand a siege,

2Ma 10:19 whereüpon, Maccabaeus left Simon and Joseph, with Zacchaeus and his forces, in sufficient
numbers to besiege them, and himself went off to other places requiring his attention.

2Ma 10:20 But Simon’s men were greedy for money and allowed themselves to be bribed by some of the men
in the towers; accepting seventy thousand drachmas, they let a number of them escape.

2Ma 10:21 When Maccabaeus was told what had happened, he summoned the people’s commanders and
accused the offenders of having sold their brothers for money by releasing their enemies to fight them.

2Ma 10:22 Having executed them as traitors, he at once proceeded to capture both towers.

2Ma 10:23 Successful in all that he undertook by force of arms, in these two fortresses he slaughtered more
than twenty thousand men.

2Ma 10:24 Timotheus, who had been beaten by the Jews once before, now assembled an enormous force of
mercenaries, mustering cavalry from Asia in considerable numbers, and soon appeared in Judaea, expecting to
conquer it by force of arms.

2Ma 10:25 At his approach, Maccabaeus and his men made their supplications to God, sprinkling earth on their
heads and putting sackcloth round their waists.

2Ma 10:26 Prostrating themselves on the terrace before the altar, they begged him to support them and to show
himself the enemy of their enemies, the adversary of their adversaries, as the Law clearly states.

2Ma 10:27 After these prayers, they armed themselves and advanced a fair distance from the city, halting when
they were close to the enemy.

2Ma 1 0:28 As the first light of dawn began to spread, the two sides joined battle, the one having as their pledge
of success and victory not only their own valour but their recourse to the Lord, the other making their own ardour
their mainstay in the fight.

2Ma 10:29 When the battle was at its height, the enemy saw five magnificent men appear from heaven on
horses with golden bridles and put themselves at the head of the Jews;

2Ma 10:30 surrounding Maccabaeus and screening him with their own armour, they kept him unscathed, while
they rained arrows and thunderbolts on the enemy until, blinded and confused, they scattered in complete
disorder.

2Ma 10:31 Twenty thousand five hundred infantry and six hundred cavalry were slaughtered.

2Ma 10:32 Timotheus himself fled to a strongly guarded citadel called Gezer, where Chaereas was in
command.

2Ma 1 0:33 For four days Maccabaeus and his men eagerly besieged the fortress,

2Ma 10:34 while the defenders, confident in the security of the place, hurled fearful blasphemies and godless
insults at them.

2Ma 10:35 At daybreak on the fifth day, twenty young men of Maccabaeus’ forces, fired with indignation at the
blasphemies, manfully assaulted the wall, with wild courage cutting down everyone they encountered.

2Ma 1 0:36 Others, in a similar scaling operation, took the defenders in the rear, and set fire to the towers,
lighting pyres on which they burned the blasphemers alive. The first, meanwhile, breaking open the gates, let the



rest of the army in and, at their head, captured the town.

2Ma 10:37 Timotheus had hidden in a storage-well, but they killed him, with his brother Chaereas, and
Apollophanes.

2Ma 10:38 When all this was over, with hymns and thanksgiving they blessed the Lord, who had shown such
great kindness to Israel and given them the victory.

2Ma 11:1 Almost immediately afterwards, Lysias, the king’s tutor and cousin, chief minister of the realm, much
disturbed at the turn of events,

2Ma 1 1 :2 mustered about eighty thousand foot soldiers and his entire cavalry and advanced against the Jews,
intending to make the city a place for Greeks to live in,

2Ma 1 1 :3 to levy a tax on the Temple as on other national shrines, and to put the office of high priest up for sale
every year;

2Ma 1 1 :4 he took no account at all of the power of God, being sublimely confident in his tens of thousands of
infantrymen, his thousands of cavalry, and his eighty elephants.

2Ma 1 1 :5 Invading Judaea, he approached Beth-Zur, a fortified position about twenty miles from Jerusalem, and
began to subject it to strong pressure.

2Ma 1 1 :6 When Maccabaeus and his men learned that Lysias was besieging the fortresses, they and the
populace with them begged the Lord with lamentation and tears to send a good angel to save Israel.

2Ma 1 1 :7 Maccabaeus himself was the first to take up his weapons, and he urged the rest to risk their lives with
him in support of their brothers; so they sallied out resolutely, as one man.

2Ma 1 1 :8 They were still near Jerusalem when a rider attired in white appeared at their head, brandishing
golden weapons.

2Ma 1 1 :9 With one accord they all blessed the God of mercy, and found themselves filled with such courage
that they were ready to lay low not men only but the fiercest beasts and walls of iron.

2Ma 11:10 They advanced in battle order with the aid of their celestial ally, the Lord having had mercy on them.
2Ma 11:11 Charging like lions on the enemy, they laid low eleven thousand of the infantry and sixteen hundred
horsemen, and routed all the rest.

2Ma 11:12 Of those, the majority got away, wounded and weaponless. Lysias himself escaped only by
ignominious flight.

2Ma 11:13 Now Lysias was not lacking in intelligence and, as he reflected on the reverse he had just suffered,
he realised that the Hebrews were invincible because the mighty God fought for them. He therefore sent them a
delegation

2Ma 11:14 to persuade them to accept reasonable terms all round, and promised to compel the king to become
their friend.

2Ma 11:15 Maccabaeus, thinking only of the common good, agreed to all that Lysias proposed, and whatever
Maccabaeus submitted to Lysias in writing concerning the Jews was granted by the king.

2Ma 11:16 Here is the text of the letter Lysias wrote to the Jews: “Lysias to the Jewish people, greetings.

2Ma 11:17 “John and Absalom, your envoys, have delivered to me the communication transcribed below,
requesting me to approve its provisions.

2Ma 11:18 Anything requiring the king’s attention I have put before him; whatever was possible, I have granted.
2Ma 11:19 Provided you maintain your goodwill towards the interests of the State, I shall do my best in the
future to promote your well-being.

2Ma 1 1 :20 As regards the details, I have given orders for your envoys and my own officials to discuss these
with you.

2Ma 1 1 :21 May you prosper. “The twenty-fourth day of Dioscorus, in the year one hundred and forty-eight”.

2Ma 1 1 :22 The king’s letter ran as follows: “King Antiochus to his brother Lysias, greetings.

2Ma 1 1 :23 “Now that our father has taken his place among the gods, our will is that the subjects of the realm be
left undisturbed to attend to their own affairs.

2Ma 1 1 :24 We understand that the Jews do not approve our father’s policy, the adoption of Greek customs, but
prefer their own way of life and ask to be allowed to observe their own laws.

2Ma 1 1 :25 Accordingly, since we intend this people to be free from vexation like any other, our ruling is that the
Temple be restored to them and that they conduct their affairs according to the customs of their ancestors.

2Ma 1 1 :26 “It will therefore be your concern to send them a mission of friendship, so that on learning our policy
they may have confidence and happily go about their business”.

2Ma 1 1 :27 The king’s letter to the Jewish nation was in these terms: “King Antiochus to the Jewish Senate and
the rest of the Jews, greetings.

2Ma 1 1 :28 “If you are well, that is as we would wish; we ourselves are in good health.

2Ma 1 1 :29 “Menelaus informs us that you wish to return home and attend to your own affairs.

2Ma 1 1 :30 Accordingly, all those who return before the thirtieth day of Xanthicus may rest assured that they
have nothing to fear.



2Ma 1 1 :31 The Jews may make use of their own kind of food and their own laws as formerly, and none of them
is to be molested in any way for any unwitting offences.

2Ma 1 1 :32 I am in fact sending Menelaus to set your minds at rest.

2Ma 1 1 :33 Farewell. The fifteenth day of Xanthicus in the year one hundred and forty-eight”.

2Ma 1 1 :34 The Romans also sent the Jews a letter, which read as follows: “Quintus Memmius, Titus Manilius,
Manius Sergius, legates of the Romans, to the people of the Jews, greetings.

2Ma 1 1 :35 “Whatever Lysias, the king’s Cousin, has granted you we also approve.

2Ma 1 1 :36 As for the matters he decided to refer to the king, consider them carefully and send someöne without
delay, if we are to interpret them to your advantage, because we are leaving for Antioch.

2Ma 1 1 :37 Lose no time, therefore, in sending us those who can tell us what your intentions are.

2Ma 1 1 :38 Farewell. “The fifteenth day of Dioscorus in the year one hundred and forty-eight”.

2Ma 12:1 These agreements once concluded, Lysias returned to the king and the Jews went back to their
farming.

2Ma 12:2 Among the local generals, Timotheus and Apollonius son of Gennaeus, as also Hieronymus and
Demophon, and Nicanor the Cypriarch as well, would not allow the Jews to live in peace and quiet.

2Ma 12:3 The people of Joppa committed a particularly wicked crime: they invited the Jews living among them
to go aboard some boats they had lying ready, taking their wives and children. There was no hint of any intention
to harm them;

2Ma 12:4 there had been a public vote by the citizens, and the Jews accepted, as well they might, being
peaceable people with no reason to suspect anything. But once out in the open sea they were all sent to the
bottom, a company of at least two hundred.

2Ma 12:5 When Judas heard of the cruel fate of his countrymen, he issued his orders to his men

2Ma 12:6 and after invoking God, the just judge, he attacked his brothers’ murderers. Under cover of dark he

set fire to the port, burned the boats and put to the sword everyone who had taken refuge there.

2Ma 12:7 As the town gates were closed, he withdrew, intending to come back and wipe out the whole
community of Joppa.

2Ma 12:8 But hearing that the people of Jamnia were planning to treat their resident Jews in the same way,

2Ma 1 2:9 he made a night attack on the Jamnites and fired the port with its fleet; the glow of the flames was
seen as far off as Jerusalem, thirty miles away.

2Ma 12:10 When they had left the town barely a mile behind them in their advance on Timotheus, Judas was
attacked by an Arab force of at least five thousand foot soldiers, with five hundred cavalry.

2Ma 12:1 1 A fierce engagement followed, and with God’s help Judas’ men won the day; the defeated nomads
begged Judas to offer them the right hand of friendship, and promised to surrender their herds and make
themselves generally useful to him.

2Ma 12:12 Realising that they might indeed prove valuable in many ways, Judas consented to make peace with
them and after an exchange of pledges the Arabs withdrew to their tents.

2Ma 12:13 Judas also attacked a certain fortified town, closed by ramparts and inhabited by a medley of races;
its name was Caspin.

2Ma 12:14 Confident in the strength of their walls and their stock of provisions, the besieged adopted an
insolent attitude to Judas and his men, reinforcing their insults with blasphemies and profanity.

2Ma 12:15 But Judas and his men invoked the great Sovereign of the world who without battering-ram or siege-
engine had overthrown Jericho in the days of Joshua; they then made a fierce assault on the wall.

2Ma 12:16 By God’s will, having captured the town, they made such indescribable slaughter that the nearby
lake, a quarter of a mile across, seemed filled to overflowing with blood.

2Ma 12:17 Ninety-five miles further on from there, they reached the Charax, in the country of Jews known as
Tubians.

2Ma 12:18 They did not find Timotheus himself in that neighbourhood; he had already left the district, having
achieved nothing apart from leaving a very strong garrison at one point.

2Ma 12:19 Dositheus and Sosipater, two of the Maccabaean generals, marched out and destroyed the force
Timotheus had left behind in the fortress, amounting to more than ten thousand men.

2Ma 12:20 Maccabaeus himself divided his army into cohorts to which he assigned commanders, and then
hurried in pursuit of Timotheus, whose troops numbered one hundred and twenty thousand infantry and two
thousand five hundred cavalry.

2Ma 12:21 Timotheus’ first move on learning of Judas’ advance was to send away the women and children and
the rest of the baggage train to the place called the Carnaim, since it was an impregnable position, difficult of
access owing to the narrowness of all the approaches.

2Ma 12:22 Judas’ cohort came into sight first. The enemy, seized with fright and panic-stricken by the
manifestation of the All-seeing, began to flee, one running this way, one running that, often wounding one
another in consequence and running on the points of one another’s swords.



2Ma 12:23 Judas pursued them with a will, cutting the sinners to pieces and killing something like thirty
thousand men.

2Ma 12:24 Timotheus himself, having fallen into the hands of Dositheus and Sosipater and their men, very
craftily pleaded with them to let him go with his life, on the grounds that he had the relatives and even the
brothers of many of them in his power, and that these could otherwise expect short shrift.

2Ma 12:25 When at long last he convinced them that he would honour his promise and return these people safe
and sound, they let him go for the sake of saving their brothers.

2Ma 12:26 Reaching the Carnaim and the Atargateion, Judas slaughtered twenty-five thousand men.

2Ma 12:27 Having defeated and destroyed them, he led his army against Ephron, a fortified town, where
Lysanias was living. Stalwart young men drawn up outside the walls offered vigorous resistance, while inside
there were quantities of war-engines and missiles in reserve.

2Ma 12:28 But the Jews, having invoked the Sovereign who by his power shatters enemies’ defences, gained
control of the town and cut down nearly twenty-five thousand of the people inside.

2Ma 12:29 Moving off from there, they pressed on to Scythopolis,

2Ma 12:30 seventy-five miles from Jerusalem. But as the Jews who had settled there assured Judas that the
people of Scythopolis had always treated them well and had been particularly kind to them when times were at
their worst,

2Ma 12:31 he and his men thanked them and urged them to extend the same friendship to his race in the future.
They reached Jerusalem shortly before the feast of Weeks.

2Ma 12:32 After Pentecost, as it is called, they marched against Gorgias, the general commanding Idumaea.
2Ma 12:33 He came out at the head of three thousand infantry and four hundred cavalry;

2Ma 12:34 in the course of the ensuing battle a few Jews lost their lives.

2Ma 12:35 A man called Dositheus, a horseman of the Tubian contingent, a valiant man, overpowered Gorgias
and, gripping him by the cloak, was forcibly dragging him along, intending to take the accursed man alive, but
one of the Thracian cavalry, hurling himself on Dositheus, slashed his shoulder, and Gorgias escaped to Marisa.
2Ma 12:36 Meanwhile, since Esdrias and his men had been fighting for a long time and were exhausted, Judas
called on the Lord to show himself their ally and leader in battle.

2Ma 12:37 Then, chanting the battle cry and hymns at the top of his voice in his ancestral tongue, by a surprise
attack he routed Gorgias’ troops.

2Ma 12:38 Judas then rallied his army and moved on to the town of Adullam where, as it was the seventh day of
the week, they purified themselves according to custom and kept the Sabbath.

2Ma 12:39 Next day, they came to find Judas (since the necessity was by now urgent) to have the bodies of the
fallen taken up and laid to rest among their relatives in their ancestral tombs.

2Ma 12:40 But when they found on each of the dead men, under their tunics, objects dedicated to the idols of
Jamnia, which the Law prohibits to Jews, it became clear to everyone that this was why these men had lost their
lives.

2Ma 12:41 All then blessed the ways of the Lord, the upright judge who brings hidden things to light,

2Ma 12:42 and gave themselves to prayer, begging that the sin committed might be completely forgiven. Next,
the valiant Judas urged the soldiers to keep themselves free from all sin, having seen with their own eyes the
effects of the sin of those who had fallen;

2Ma 12:43 after this he took a collection from them individually, amounting to nearly two thousand drachmas,
and sent it to Jerusalem to have a sacrifice for sin offered, an action altogether fine and noble, prompted by his
belief in the resurrection.

2Ma 12:44 For had he not expected the fallen to rise again, it would have been superfluous and foolish to pray
for the dead,

2Ma 12:45 whereäs if he had in view the splendid recompense reserved for those who make a pious end, the
thought was holy and devout. Hence, he had this expiatory sacrifice offered for the dead, so that they might be
released from their sin.

2Ma 13:1 In the year one hundred and forty-nine, Judas and his men discovered that Antiochus Eupatorwas
advancing in force against Judaea,

2Ma 1 3:2 and with him Lysias his tutor and chief minister; he had moreover a Greek force of one hundred and
ten thousand infantry, five thousand three hundred cavalry, twenty-two elephants, and three hundred chariots
fitted with scythes.

2Ma 1 3:3 Menelaus, too, joined them and very craftily kept urging Antiochus on, not for the welfare of his own
country but in the hope of being restored to office.

2Ma 13:4 But the King of kings stirred up the anger of Antiochus against the guilty wretch, and when Lysias
made it clear to the king that Menelaus was the cause of all the troubles, Antiochus gave orders for him to be
taken to Beroea and there put to death by the local method of execution.

2Ma 13:5 In that place there is a tower fifty cubits high, full of ash, with an internal lip all round overhanging the



ashes.

2Ma 1 3:6 If anyone is convicted of sacrilegious theft or of some other heinous crime, he is taken up to the top
and pushed over to perish.

2Ma 13:7 In such a manner was the renegade fated to die; Menelaus had not even the privilege of burial.

2Ma 13:8 Deserved justice, this; since he had committed many sins against the altar, the fire and ashes of
which were holy, it was in ashes that he met his death.

2Ma 13:9 The king, then, was advancing, his mind filled with barbarous designs, to give the Jews a
demonstration of far worse things than anything that had happened under his father.

2Ma 13:10 When Judas heard of this, he ordered the people day and night to call on the Lord as never before,
to come to the help of those who were in peril of being deprived of the Law, their fatherland and the holy Temple,
2Ma 13:1 1 and not to allow the people, just when they were beginning to breathe again, to fall into the power of
ill-famed foreigners.

2Ma 13:12 When they had all, with one voice, obeyed his instructions and had made their petitions to the
merciful Lord, weeping, fasting and prostrating themselves for three days continuously, Judas spoke words of
encouragement and told them to keep close to him.

2Ma 13:13 After separate consultation with the elders, he resolved not to wait for the king’s army to invade
Judaea and take possession of the city, but to march out and settle the whole matter with the Lord’s help.

2Ma 13:14 Having thus committed the outcome to the Creator of the world, and having exhorted his soldiers to
fight bravely to the death for the laws, the Temple, the city, their country and their way of life, he encamped his
army near Modein.

2Ma 13:15 Giving his men the password “Victory from God”, he made a night attack on the king’s pavilion with a
picked band of the bravest young men. Inside the camp he destroyed about two thousand, and his men cut
down the largest of the elephants with its mahout;

2Ma 13:16 having eventually filled the camp with terror and confusion, they successfully withdrew,

2Ma 13:17 just as dawn was breaking. This was achieved, thanks to the protection which the Lord granted
Judas.

2Ma 13:18 The king, having had a taste of Jewish daring, now tried to capture their positions by trickery.

2Ma 13:19 He advanced on Beth-Zur, a strong fortress of the Jews, but was checked, overcome and so
repulsed.

2Ma 13:20 Judas supplied the garrison with what they needed,

2Ma 13:21 but Rhodocus, of the Jewish army, supplied the enemy with secret information; the man was
identified, arrested, and dealt with.

2Ma 13:22 A second time, the king parleyed with the garrison of Beth-Zur; he offered and accepted pledges of
friendship, retired, then attacked Judas and his men, but lost the battle.

2Ma 1 3:23 He was then told that Philip, left in charge of affairs, had rebelled in Antioch. He was stunned by this,
opened negotiations with the Jews, came to an agreement, and swore to abide by all reasonable conditions.
Agreement reached, he offered a sacrifice, honoured the Temple, and made generous gifts to the holy place.
2Ma 13:24 He received Maccabaeus kindly and, leaving Hegemonides to exercise command from Ptolemais to
the territory of the Gerrenians,

2Ma 1 3:25 went to Ptolemais. The inhabitants of the place disapproved of the treaty; they complained furiously
and wanted to annul its provisions.

2Ma 13:26 Lysias mounted the rostrum and made a convincing defence of the provisions which convinced and
calmed them and won their goodwill. He then withdrew to Antioch. So much for the episode of the king’s
offensive and retreat.

2Ma 14:1 Three years after this, Judas and his men learned that Demetrius son of Seleucus had landed at the
port of Tripolis with a strong army and a fleet,

2Ma 14:2 and that he had occupied the country and had killed Antiochus and his tutor Lysias.

2Ma 14:3 A certain Alcimus, a former high priest, had wilfully incurred defilement at the time of the insurrection;
realising that whichever way he turned there was no security for him, nor any further access to the holy altar,

2Ma 14:4 he went to King Demetrius in about the year one hundred and fifty-one and presented him with a
golden crown and a palm, together with the traditional olive branches from the Temple; there, for that day, he let
the matter rest.

2Ma 14:5 Presently he found an opportunity to further his mad plan. When Demetrius called him into his council
and questioned him about the dispositions and intentions of the Jews, he replied,

2Ma 14:6 “Those Jews called Hasidaeans, who are led by Judas Maccabaeus, are war-mongers and rebels who
are preventing the kingdom from finding stability.

2Ma 14:7 That is why, after being deprived of my hereditary dignity — 1 mean the high priesthood — 1 have come
here now,

2Ma 14:8 first out of genuine concern for the king’s interests, and secondly, out of a regard for our own fellow-



citizens, because the irresponsible behaviour of those I have mentioned has brought no slight misery on our
entire race.

2Ma 14:9 When your majesty has taken note of all these points, may it please you to make provision for the
welfare of our country and our oppressed nation, as befits the gracious benevolence you extend to all;

2Ma 14:10 for, as long as Judas remains alive, the State will never enjoy peace”.

2Ma 14:11 No sooner had he spoken thus than the rest of the King’s Friends, who were hostile to Judas’
activities, stoked Demetrius’ anger.

2Ma 14:12 The latter at once selected Nicanor, then commander of the elephants, promoted him to the
command of Judaea and despatched him

2Ma 14:13 with instructions to dispose of Judas, disperse his followers and instal Alcimus as high priest of the
greatest of temples.

2Ma 14:14 The foreigners in Judaea, who had fled before Judas, flocked to join Nicanor, thinking that the
misfortunes and troubles of the Jews would be to their own advantage.

2Ma 14:15 When the Jews heard that Nicanor was coming and that the foreigners were about to attack, they
sprinkled dust over themselves and made supplication to him who had established his people for ever and who
never failed to support his own heritage by direct manifestations.

2Ma 14:16 On their leader’s orders, they at once left the place where they were and confronted the enemy at
the village of Dessau.

2Ma 14:17 Simon, brother of Judas, engaged Nicanor but, owing to the sudden arrival of the enemy, suffered a
slight reverse.

2Ma 14:18 Nicanor, however, had heard how brave Judas and his men were and how resolutely they always
fought for their country, and he did not dare allow bloodshed to decide the issue.

2Ma 14:19 And so he sent Posidonius, Theodotus and Mattathias to offer the Jews pledges of friendship and to
accept theirs.

2Ma 14:20 After careful consideration of his terms, the leader communicated them to his troops, and since they
were all clearly of one mind they agreed to the treaty.

2Ma 14:21 A day was fixed on which the respective leaders were to meet as individuals. A litter came out from
either side and seats were set up.

2Ma 14:22 Judas had posted armed men in strategic positions, in case of a sudden treacherous move by the
enemy. The leaders held their conference and reached agreement.

2Ma 14:23 Nicanor took up residence in Jerusalem and did nothing out of place there; indeed, he sent away the
crowds that had flocked to join him.

2Ma 14:24 He kept Judas constantly with him, becoming deeply attached to him

2Ma 14:25 and encouraged him to marry and have children. Judas married, settled down and led a normal life.
2Ma 14:26 When Alcimus saw how friendly the two men had become, he went to Demetrius with a copy of the
treaty they had signed and told him that Nicanor was harbouring thoughts against the interests of the State, and
was planning that Judas, an enemy of the realm, should fill the next vacancy among the Friends of the King.

2Ma 14:27 The king flew into a rage; roused by the slanders of this villain, he wrote to Nicanor, telling him of his
strong displeasure at these agreements and ordering him immediately to send Maccabaeus to Antioch in chains.
2Ma 14:28 When the letter reached Nicanor, he was very much upset, for he disliked the prospect of breaking
an agreement with a man who had done nothing wrong.

2Ma 14:29 Since, however, there was no way of opposing the king, he waited for an opportunity to carry out the
order by a stratagem.

2Ma 14:30 Maccabaeus began to notice that Nicanor was treating him more sharply and that his manner of
speaking to him was more abrupt than it had been, and he concluded that such sharpness could have no very
good motive. He therefore collected a considerable number of his followers and got away from Nicanor.

2Ma 14:31 The latter, realising that the man had well and truly outmanoeuvred him, went to the greatest and
holiest of Temples when the priests were offering the customary sacrifices, and ordered them to surrender
Judas.

2Ma 14:32 When they protested on oath that they did not know where the wanted man could be,

2Ma 14:33 he stretched out his right hand towards the Temple and swore this oath, “If you do not hand Judas
over to me as prisoner, I shall rase this dwelling of God to the ground, I shall demolish the altar, and on this very
spot I shall erect a splendid temple to Dionysus”.

2Ma 14:34 With these words he left them. The priests stretched out their hands to heaven, calling on him who
has at all times done battle for our nation; this was their prayer:

2Ma 14:35 “O Lord in need of nothing, it has pleased you that the Temple where you dwell should be here with
us.

2Ma 14:36 Now, therefore, holy Lord of all holiness, preserve for ever from all profanation this House, so newly
purified”.



2Ma 14:37 Now, a man called Razis, one of the elders of Jerusalem, was denounced to Nicanor. He was a man
who loved his countrymen and stood high in their esteem, and he was known as the father of the Jews because
of his kindness.

2Ma 14:38 In the earlier days of the insurrection he had been convicted of Judaism, and he had risked both life
and limb for Judaism with the utmost zeal.

2Ma 1 4:39 Nicanor, by way of demonstrating the enmity he had for the Jews, sent over five hundred soldiers to
arrest him,

2Ma 14:40 reckoning that if he eliminated this man he would be dealing them a severe blow.

2Ma 14:41 When the troops were on the point of capturing the tower and were forcing the outer door and calling
for fire to set the doors alight, Razis, finding himself completely surrounded, fell on his own sword,

2Ma 14:42 nobly resolving to die rather than fall into the clutches of these villains and suffer outrages unworthy
of his noble birth.

2Ma 14:43 But in the heat of conflict he missed his thrust, and while the troops swarmed in through the
doorways, he ran nimbly upstairs to the parapet and manfully threw himself down among the troops.

2Ma 14:44 But, as they immediately drew back, he fell into the middle of the empty space.

2Ma 14:45 Still breathing, and blazing with anger, he struggled to his feet, blood spurting in all directions, and
despite his terrible wounds ran right through the crowd; then, taking his stand on a steep rock,

2Ma 14:46 although he had now lost every drop of blood, he tore out his entrails and taking them in both hands
flung them down on the crowd, calling on the Master of his life and spirit to give them back to him one day. Thus
he died.

2Ma 15:1 Nicanor heard that Judas and his men were in the neighbourhood of Samaria, so he decided to attack
them, at no risk to himself, on the day of rest.

2Ma 15:2 Those Jews who had been compelled to follow him, said, “Do not massacre them in such a savage,
barbarous way. Respect the day on which the All-seeing has conferred a special holiness”.

2Ma 15:3 At this the triple-dyed scoundrel asked if there were in heaven a sovereign who had ordered the
keeping of the Sabbath day.

2Ma 15:4 When they answered, “The living Lord himself, the Heavenly Sovereign, has ordered the observance
of the seventh day”,

2Ma 15:5 he retorted, “And I, as sovereign on earth, order you to take up arms and do the king’s business”. For
all that, he did not manage to carry out his wicked plan.

2Ma 15:6 While Nicanor, in his unlimited boastfulness and pride, was planning to erect a general trophy with the
spoils taken from Judas and his men,

2Ma 15:7 Maccabaeus remained firm in his confident conviction that the Lord would stand by him.

2Ma 15:8 He urged his men not to be dismayed by the foreigners’ attacks but, keeping in mind the help that had
come to them from Heaven in the past, to be confident that this time too victory would be theirs with the help of
the Almighty.

2Ma 15:9 He put fresh heart into them by citing the Law and the Prophets and, by stirring up memories of the
battles they had already won, he filled them with new enthusiasm.

2Ma 15:10 Having thus aroused their courage, he ended his exhortation by demonstrating the treachery of the
foreigners and how they had violated their oaths.

2Ma 15:1 1 Having armed each one of them not so much with the safety given by shield and lance as with that
confidence which springs from noble language, he encouraged them all by describing to them a convincing
dream — a vision, as it were.

2Ma 15:12 What he had seen was this: Onias, the former high priest, that paragon of men, modest of bearing
and gentle of manners, suitably eloquent and trained from boyhood in the practice of every virtue — Onias was
stretching out his hands and praying for the whole Jewish community.

2Ma 15:13 Next, there appeared a man equally remarkable for his great age and dignity and invested with a
marvellous and impressive air of majesty.

2Ma 15:14 Onias began to speak: “This is a man”, he said, “who loves his brothers and prays much for the
people and the holy city-Jeremiah, the prophet of God”.

2Ma 15:15 Jeremiah then stretched out his right hand and presented Judas with a golden sword, saying as he
gave it,

2Ma 15:16 “Take this holy sword as a gift from God; with it you will shatter the enemy”.

2Ma 15:17 Encouraged by the noble words of Judas, which had the power to inspire valour and give the young
the spirit of mature men, they decided not to entrench themselves in a camp, but bravely to take the offensive
and, in hand-to-hand fighting, to commit the result to the fortune of war, since the city, their holy religion and the
Temple were in danger.

2Ma 15:18 Their concern for their wives and children, their brothers and relatives, had shrunk to minute
importance; their chief and greatest fear was for the consecrated Temple.



2Ma 15:19 Those left behind in the city felt a similar anxiety, alarmed as they were about the forthcoming
encounter in the open country.

2Ma 15:20 Everyone now awaited the coming issue. The enemy had already concentrated their forces and
stood formed up in order of battle, with the elephants drawn up in a strategic position and the cavalry disposed
on the wings.

2Ma 15:21 Maccabaeus took note of these masses confronting him, the glittering array of armour and the fierce
aspect of the elephants; then, raising his hands to heaven, he called on the Lord who works miracles, in the
knowledge that it is not by force of arms but as he sees fit to decide, that victory is granted by him to such as
deserve it.

2Ma 15:22 His prayer was worded thus: “You, Master, sent your angel in the days of Hezekiah king of Judaea,
and he destroyed no less than one hundred and eighty-five thousand of Sennacherib’s army;

2Ma 15:23 now, once again, Sovereign of heaven, send a good angel before us to spread terror and dismay.
2Ma 15:24 May these men be struck down by the might of your arm, since they have come with blasphemy on
their lips to attack your holy people”. And on these words he finished.

2Ma 15:25 Nicanor and his men advanced to the sound of trumpets and war songs,

2Ma 15:26 but the men of Judas closed with the enemy uttering invocations and prayers.

2Ma 15:27 Fighting with their hands and praying to God in their hearts, they cut down at least thirty-five
thousand men and were greatly cheered by this manifestation of God.

2Ma 15:28 When the engagement was over and they were withdrawing in triumph, they recognised Nicanor,
lying dead in full armour.

2Ma 15:29 With shouting and confusion all around, they blessed the sovereign Master in their ancestral tongue.
2Ma 15:30 He who, as protagonist, had devoted himself, body and soul, to his fellow-citizens, and had
preserved the love he felt even in youth for those of his own race, gave orders for Nicanor’s head to be cut off,
with his arm up to the shoulder, and taken to Jerusalem.

2Ma 15:31 When he arrived there himself, he called his countrymen together, stationed the priests in front of the
altar and then sent for the people from the Citadel.

2Ma 15:32 He showed them the head of the abominable Nicanor, and the hand which this infamous man had
stretched out so insolently against the holy House of the Almighty.

2Ma 1 5:33 Then, cutting out godless Nicanor’s tongue, he gave orders for it to be fed piecemeal to the birds,
and for the salary of his folly to be hung up in front of the Temple.

2Ma 15:34 At this, everyone sent blessings heavenwards to the glorious Lord, saying, “Blessed be he who has
preserved his holy place from pollution!”.

2Ma 15:35 He hung Nicanor’s head from the Citadel, a clear and evident sign to all of the help of the Lord.

2Ma 15:36 They all decreed by public vote never to let that day go by unobserved, but to celebrate the
thirteenth day of the twelfth month, called Adar in Aramaic, the eve of what is called the Day of Mordecai.

2Ma 15:37 So ends the episode of Nicanor, and as, since then, the city has remained in the possession of the
Hebrews, I shall bring my own work to an end here too.

2Ma 15:38 If it is well composed and to the point, that is just what I wanted. If it is worthless and mediocre, that
is all I could manage.

2Ma 15:39 Just as it is injurious to drink wine by itself, or again water alone, whereäs wine mixed with water is
pleasant and produces a delightful sense of well-being, so skill in presenting the incidents is what delights the
understanding of those who read the book. And here I close.






Sir 1:1 [The Law, the Prophets, and the other writers succeeding them have passed on to us great lessons, in
consequence of which Israel must be commended for learning and wisdom. Furthermore, it is a duty, not only to
acquire learning by reading, but also, once having acquired it, to make oneself of use to people outsideby what
one can say or write. My grandfather Jesus, having long devoted himself to the readingof the Law, the
Prophets and other books of the Fathersand having become very learned in them, himself decided to write
something on the subjects of learning and wisdom, so that people who wanted to learn might, by themselves
accepting these disciplines, learn how better to live according to the Law.You are therefore askedto read this
bookwith good will and attentionand to show indulgencein those places where, notwithstanding our efforts at
interpretation, we may seemto have failed to give an adequate rendering of this or that expression;the fact is that
there is no equivalentfor things originally written in Hebrew when it is a question of translating them into another
language;what is more, the Law itself, the Prophets and the other booksdiffer considerably in translation from
what appears in the original text. It was in the thirty-eighth year of the late King Euergetesthat, coming to Egypt
and spending some time here, and finding life here consistent with a high degree of wisdom, I became convinced
of an immediate duty to apply myself in my turn with pains and diligence to the translation of the book that
follows;and I spent much time and learning on itin the course of this period, to complete the work and to publish
the bookfor the benefit of those too who, domiciled abroad, wish to study, to reform their behaviour, and to live as
the Law requires.] All wisdom comes from the Lord, she is with him for ever.

Sir 1 :2 The sands of the sea, the drops of rain, the days of eternity — who can count them?

Sir 1 :3 The height of the sky, the breadth of the earth, the depth of the abyss — who can explore them?

Sir 1 :4 Wisdom was created before everything, prudent understanding subsists from remotest ages.

Sir 1:5

Sir 1 :6 For whom has the root of wisdom ever been uncovered? Her resourceful ways, who knows them?

Sir 1:7

Sir 1 :8 One only is wise, terrible indeed,

Sir 1 :9 seated on his throne, the Lord. It was he who created, inspected and weighed her up, and then poured
her out on all his works-

Sir 1:10 as much to each living creature as he chose — bestowing her on those who love him.

Sir 1:11 The fear of the Lord is glory and pride, happiness and a crown of joyfulness.

Sir 1:12 The fear of the Lord gladdens the heart, giving happiness, joy and long life.

Sir 1:13 For those who fear the Lord, all will end well: on their dying day they will be blessed.

Sir 1:14 The basis of wisdom is to fear the Lord; she was created with the faithful in their mothers’ womb;

Sir 1:15 she has made a home in the human race, an age - old foundation, and to their descendants will she
faithfully cling.

Sir 1:16 The fullness of wisdom is to fear the Lord; she intoxicates them with her fruits;

Sir 1:17 she fills their entire house with treasures and their storerooms with her produce.

Sir 1:18 The crown of wisdom is to fear the Lord: she makes peace and health flourish.

Sir 1:19 The Lord has seen and assessed her, he has showered down knowledge and intelligence, he has
exalted the renown of those who possess her.

Sir 1 :20 The root of wisdom is to fear the Lord, and her branches are long life.

Sir 1:21

Sir 1 :22 The rage of the wicked cannot put him in the right, for the weight of his rage is his downfall.

Sir 1 :23 A patient person puts up with things until the right time comes: but his joy will break out in the end.

Sir 1 :24 until the time comes he keeps his thoughts to himself, and many a lip will affirm how wise he is.

Sir 1 :25 Wisdom’s treasuries contain the maxims of knowledge, the sinner, however, holds piety in abhorrence.



Sir 1 :26 If you desire wisdom, keep the commandments, and the Lord will bestow it on you.

Sir 1 :27 For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and instruction, and what pleases him is faithfulness and gentleness.
Sir 1 :28 Do not stand out against fear of the Lord, do not practise it with a double heart.

Sir 1 :29 Do not act a part in public, keep watch over your lips.

Sir 1 :30 Do not grow too high and mighty, for fear you fall and cover yourself in disgrace; for the Lord would
then reveal your secrets and overthrow you before the whole community for not having practised fear of the Lord
and for having a heart full of deceit.

Sir 2:1 My child, if you aspire to serve the Lord, prepare yourself for an ordeal.

Sir 2:2 Be sincere of heart, be steadfast, and do not be alarmed when disaster comes.

Sir 2:3 Cling to him and do not leave him, so that you may be honoured at the end of your days.

Sir 2:4 Whatever happens to you, accept it, and in the uncertainties of your humble state, be patient,

Sir 2:5 since gold is tested in the fire, and the chosen in the furnace of humiliation.

Sir 2:6 Trust him and he will uphold you, follow a straight path and hope in him.

Sir 2:7 You who fear the Lord, wait for his mercy; do not turn aside, for fear you fall.

Sir 2:8 You who fear the Lord, trust him, and you will not be robbed of your reward.

Sir 2:9 You who fear the Lord, hope for those good gifts of his, everlasting joy and mercy.

Sir 2:10 Look at the generations of old and see: whoëver trusted in the Lord and was put to shame? Or
whoëver, steadfastly fearing him, was forsaken? Or whoëver called to him and was ignored?

Sir 2:1 1 For the Lord is compassionate and merciful, he forgives sins and saves in the time of distress.

Sir 2:12 Woe to faint hearts and listless hands, and to the sinner who treads two paths.

Sir 2:13 Woe to the listless heart that has no faith, for such will have no protection.

Sir 2:14 Woe to you who have lost the strength to endure; what will you do at the Lord’s visitation?

Sir 2:15 Those who fear the Lord do not disdain his words, and those who love him keep his ways.

Sir 2:16 Those who fear the Lord do their best to please him, and those who love him will find satisfaction in the
Law.

Sir 2:17 Those who fear the Lord keep their hearts prepared and humble themselves in his presence.

Sir 2:18 Let us fall into the hands of the Lord, not into any human clutches; for as his majesty is, so too is his
mercy.

Sir 3:1 Children, listen to me for I am your father: do what I tell you, and so be safe;

Sir 3:2 for the Lord honours the father above his children and upholds the rights of a mother over her sons.

Sir 3:3 Whoëver respects a father expiates sins,

Sir 3:4 whoëver honours a mother is like someöne amassing a fortune.

Sir 3:5 Whoëver respects a father will in turn be happy with children, the day he prays for help, he will be heard.
Sir 3:6 Long life comes to anyone who honours a father, whoëver obeys the Lord makes a mother happy.

Sir 3:7 Such a one serves parents as well as the Lord.

Sir 3:8 Respect your father in deed as well as word, so that blessing may come on you from him;

Sir 3:9 since a father’s blessing makes his children’s house firm, while a mother’s curse tears up its foundations.
Sir 3:10 Do not make a boast of disgrace overtaking your father, your father’s disgrace reflects no honour on
you;

Sir 3:1 1 for a person’s own honour derives from the respect shown to his father, and a mother held in dishonour
is a reproach to her children.

Sir 3:12 My child, support your father in his old age, do not grieve him during his life.

Sir 3:13 Even if his mind should fail, show him sympathy, do not despise him in your health and strength;

Sir 3:14 for kindness to a father will not be forgotten but will serve as reparation for your sins.

Sir 3:15 On your own day of ordeal God will remember you: like frost in sunshine, your sins will melt away.

Sir 3:16 Whoëver deserts a father is no better than a blasphemer, and whoëver distresses a mother is accursed
of the Lord.

Sir 3:17 My child, be gentle in carrying out your business, and you will be better loved than a lavish giver.

Sir 3:18 The greater you are, the more humbly you should behave, and then you will find favour with the Lord;
Sir 3:19

Sir 3:20 for great though the power of the Lord is, he accepts the homage of the humble.

Sir 3:21 Do not try to understand things that are too difficult for you, or try to discover what is beyond your
powers.

Sir 3:22 Concentrate on what has been assigned you, you have no need to worry over mysteries.

Sir 3:23 Do not meddle with matters that are beyond you; what you have been taught already exceeds the
scope of the human mind.

Sir 3:24 For many have been misled by their own notions, wicked presumption having warped their judgement.
Sir 3:25

Sir 3:26 A stubborn heart will come to a bad end, and whoëver dallies with danger will perish in it.



Sir 3:27 A stubborn heart is weighed down with troubles, the sinner heaps sin on sin.

Sir 3:28 For the disease of the proud there is no cure, since an evil growth has taken root there.

Sir 3:29 The heart of the sensible will reflect on parables, an attentive ear is the sage’s dream.

Sir 3:30 Water puts out a blazing fire, almsgiving expiates sins.

Sir 3:31 Whoëver gives favours in return is mindful of the future; at the moment of falling, such a person will find
support.

Sir 4:1 My child, do not refuse the poor a livelihood, do not tantalise the needy.

Sir 4:2 Do not add to the sufferings of the hungry, do not bait anyone in distress.

Sir 4:3 Do not aggravate a heart already angry, nor keep the destitute waiting for your alms.

Sir 4:4 Do not repulse a hard-pressed beggar, nor turn your face from the poor.

Sir 4:5 Do not avert your eyes from the needy, give no one occasion to curse you;

Sir 4:6 for if someöne curses you in distress, his Maker will give ear to the imprecation.

Sir 4:7 Gain the love of the community, in the presence of the great bow your head.

Sir 4:8 To the poor lend an ear, and courteously return the greeting.

Sir 4:9 Save the oppressed from the hand of the oppressor, and do not be mean-spirited in your judgements.

Sir 4:10 Be like a father to the fatherless and as good as a husband to their mothers. And you will be like a child
to the Most High, who will love you more than your own mother does.

Sir 4:1 1 Wisdom brings up her own children and cares for those who seek her.

Sir 4:12 Whoëver loves her loves life, those who seek her early will be filled with joy.

Sir 4:13 Whoëver possesses her will inherit honour, and wherever he walks the Lord will bless him.

Sir 4:14 Those who serve her minister to the Holy One, and the Lord loves those who love her.

Sir 4:15 Whoëver obeys her rules the nations, whoëver pays attention to her dwells secure.

Sir 4:16 If he trusts himself to her he will inherit her, and his descendants will remain in possession of her;

Sir 4:17 for though she takes him at first through winding ways, bringing fear and faintness on him, trying him
out with her discipline until she can trust him, and testing him with her ordeals,

Sir 4:18 she then comes back to him on the straight road, makes him happy and reveals her secrets to him.

Sir 4:19 If he goes astray, however, she abandons him and leaves him to his own destruction.

Sir 4:20 Take circumstances into account and beware of evil, and have no cause to be ashamed of yourself;

Sir 4:21 for there is a shame that leads to sin and a shame that is honourable and gracious.

Sir 4:22 Do not be too severe on yourself, do not let shame lead you to ruin.

Sir 4:23 Do not refrain from speaking when it will do good, and do not hide your wisdom;

Sir 4:24 for your wisdom is made known by what you say, your erudition by the words you utter.

Sir 4:25 Do not contradict the truth, rather blush for your own ignorance.

Sir 4:26 Do not be ashamed to confess your sins, do not struggle against the current of the river.

Sir 4:27 Do not grovel to the foolish, do not show partiality to the influential.

Sir 4:28 Fight to the death for truth, and the Lord God will war on your side.

Sir 4:29 Do not be bold of tongue, yet idle and slack in deed;

Sir 4:30 do not be like a lion at home, or cowardly towards your servants.

Sir 4:31 Do not let your hands be outstretched to receive, yet tight-fisted when the time comes to give back.

Sir 5:1 Do not put your confidence in your money or say, “With this I am self-sufficient”.

Sir 5:2 Do not be led by your appetites and energy to follow the passions of your heart.

Sir 5:3 And do not say, “Who has authority over me?”. for the Lord will certainly give you your deserts.

Sir 5:4 Do not say, “I have sinned, but what harm has befallen me?”. for the Lord’s forbearance is long.

Sir 5:5 Do not be so sure of forgiveness that you add sin to sin.

Sir 5:6 And do not say, “His compassion is great, he will forgive me my many sins”; for with him are both mercy
and retribution, and his anger does not pass from sinners.

Sir 5:7 Do not delay your return to the Lord, do not put it off day after day; for suddenly the Lord’s wrath will
blaze out, and on the day of punishment you will be utterly destroyed.

Sir 5:8 Do not set your heart on ill-gotten gains, they will be of no use to you on the day of disaster.

Sir 5:9 Do not winnow in every wind, or walk along every by-way (as the double-talking sinner does).

Sir 5:10 Be steady in your convictions, and be a person of your word.

Sir 5:1 1 Be quick to listen, and deliberate in giving an answer.

Sir 5:12 If you understand the matter, give your neighbour an answer, if not, keep your hand over your mouth.
Sir 5:13 Both honour and disgrace come from talking, the tongue is its owner’s downfall.

Sir 5:14 Do not get a name for scandal-mongering, do not set traps with your tongue; for as shame lies in store
for the thief, so harsh condemnation awaits the deceitful.

Sir 5:15 Avoid offences in great as in small matters, and do not exchange friendship for enmity,

Sir 6:1 for a bad name will earn you shame and reproach, as happens to the double-talking sinner.

Sir 6:2 Do not get carried aloft on the wings of passion, for fear your strength tear itself apart like a bull,



Sir 6:3 and you devour your own foliage and destroy your own fruit and end by making yourself like a piece of
dried-up wood.

Sir 6:4 An evil temper destroys the person who has it and makes him the laughing-stock of his enemies.

Sir 6:5 A kindly turn of speech attracts new friends, a courteous tongue invites many a friendly response.

Sir 6:6 Let your acquaintances be many, but for advisers choose one out of a thousand.

Sir 6:7 If you want to make a friend, take him on trial, and do not be in a hurry to trust him;

Sir 6:8 for one kind of friend is so only when it suits him but will not stand by you in your day of trouble.

Sir 6:9 Another kind of friend will fall out with you and to your dismay make your quarrel public,

Sir 6:10 and a third kind of friend will share your table, but not stand by you in your day of trouble:

Sir 6:1 1 when you are doing well he will be your second self, ordering your servants about;

Sir 6:12 but, if disaster befalls you, he will recoil from you and keep out of your way.

Sir 6:13 Keep well clear of your enemies, and be wary of your friends.

Sir 6:14 A loyal friend is a powerful defence: whoëver finds one has indeed found a treasure.

Sir 6:15 A loyal friend is something beyond price, there is no measuring his worth.

Sir 6:16 A loyal friend is the elixir of life, and those who fear the Lord will find one.

Sir 6:17 Whoëver fears the Lord makes true friends, for as a person is, so is his friend too.

Sir 6:18 My child, from your earliest youth choose instruction, and until your hair is white you will keep finding
wisdom.

Sir 6:19 Like ploughman and sower, cultivate her and wait for her fine harvest, for in tilling her you will toil a little
while, but very soon you will be eating her crops.

Sir 6:20 How very harsh she is to the undisciplined! The senseless does not stay with her for long:

Sir 6:21 she will weigh as heavily on the senseless as a touchstone and such a person will lose no time in
throwing her off;

Sir 6:22 for Wisdom is true to her name, she is not accessible to many.

Sir 6:23 Listen, my child, and take my advice, do not reject my counsel:

Sir 6:24 put your feet into her fetters, and your neck into her collar;

Sir 6:25 offer your shoulder to her burden, do not be impatient of her bonds;

Sir 6:26 court her with all your soul, and with all your might keep in her ways;

Sir 6:27 search for her, track her down: she will reveal herself; once you hold her, do not let her go.

Sir 6:28 For in the end you will find rest in her and she will take the form of joy for you:

Sir 6:29 her fetters you will find a mighty defence, her collars, a precious necklace.

Sir 6:30 Her yoke will be a golden ornament, and her bonds be purple ribbons;

Sir 6:31 you will wear her like a robe of honour, you will put her on like a crown of joy.

Sir 6:32 If you wish it, my child, you can be taught; apply yourself, and you will become intelligent.

Sir 6:33 If you love listening, you will learn, if you pay attention, you will become wise.

Sir 6:34 Attend the gathering of elders; if there is a wise man there, attach yourself to him.

Sir 6:35 Listen willingly to any discourse coming from God, do not let wise proverbs escape you.

Sir 6:36 If you see a man of understanding, visit him early, let your feet wear out his doorstep.

Sir 6:37 Reflect on the injunctions of the Lord, busy yourself at all times with his commandments. He will
strengthen your mind, and the wisdom you desire will be granted you.

Sir 7:1 Do no evil, and evil will not befall you;

Sir 7:2 shun wrong, and it will avoid you.

Sir 7:3 My child, do not sow in the furrows of wickedness, for fear you have to reap them seven times over.

Sir 7:4 Do not ask the Lord for the highest place, or the king for a seat of honour.

Sir 7:5 Do not parade your uprightness before the Lord, or your wisdom before the king.

Sir 7:6 Do not scheme to be appointed judge, for fear you should not be strong enough to stamp out injustice,

for fear of being swayed by someöne influential and so of risking the loss of your integrity.

Sir 7:7 Do not wrong the general body of citizens and so lower yourself in popular esteem.

Sir 7:8 Do not be drawn to sin twice over, for you will not go unpunished even once.

Sir 7:9 Do not say, “God will be impressed by my numerous offerings; when I sacrifice to God Most High, he is

bound to accept”.

Sir 7:10 Do not be hesitant in prayer; do not neglect to give alms.

Sir 7:1 1 Do not laugh at someöne who is sad of heart, for he who brings low can lift up high.

Sir 7:12 Do not make up lies against your brother, nor against a friend either.

Sir 7:13 Mind you tell no lies, for no good can come of it.

Sir 7:14 Do not talk too much at the gathering of elders, and do not repeat yourself at your prayers.

Sir 7:15 Do not shirk tiring jobs or farm work, ordained by the Most High.

Sir 7:16 Do not swell the ranks of sinners, remember that the retribution will not delay.

Sir 7:17 Be very humble, since the recompense for the godless is fire and worms.



Sir 7:18 Do not barter a friend away for the sake of profit, nor a true brother for the gold of Ophir.

Sir 7:19 Do not turn against a wise and good wife; her gracious presence is worth more than gold.

Sir 7:20 Do not ill-treat a slave who is an honest worker, or a wage-earner who is devoted to you.

Sir 7:21 Love an intelligent slave with all your heart, and do not deny such a slave his freedom.

Sir 7:22 Have you cattle? Look after them; if they are making you a profit, keep them.

Sir 7:23 Have you children? Educate them, from childhood make them bow the neck.

Sir 7:24 Have you daughters? Take care of their bodies, but do not be over-indulgent.

Sir 7:25 Marry a daughter off, and you have finished a great work; but give her to a man of sense.

Sir 7:26 Have you a wife to your liking? Do not turn her out; but if you do not love her, never trust her.

Sir 7:27 With all your heart honour your father, never forget the birthpangs of your mother.

Sir 7:28 Remember that you owe your birth to them; how can you repay them for what they have done for you?
Sir 7:29 With all your soul, fear the Lord and revere his priests.

Sir 7:30 With all your might love him who made you, and do not abandon his ministers.

Sir 7:31 Fear the Lord and honour the priest and give him the portion enjoined on you: first-fruits, sacrifice of
reparation, shoulder-gift, sanctification sacrifice, first-fruits of the holy things.

Sir 7:32 And also give generously to the poor, so that your blessing may lack nothing.

Sir 7:33 Let your generosity extend to all the living, do not withhold it even from the dead.

Sir 7:34 Do not turn your back on those who weep, but share the grief of the grief-stricken.

Sir 7:35 Do not shrink from visiting the sick; in this way you will make yourself loved.

Sir 7:36 In everything you do, remember your end, and you will never sin.

Sir 8:1 Do not try conclusions with anyone influential, in case you later fall into his clutches.

Sir 8:2 Do not quarrel with anyone rich, in case he puts his weight against you; for gold has destroyed many,
and has swayed the hearts of kings.

Sir 8:3 Do not argue with anyone argumentative, do not pile wood on that fire.

Sir 8:4 Do not joke with anyone uncouth, for fear of hearing your ancestors insulted.

Sir 8:5 Do not revile a repentant sinner; remember that we all are guilty.

Sir 8:6 Do not despise anyone in old age; after all, some of us too are growing old.

Sir 8:7 Do not gloat over anyone’s death; remember that we all have to die.

Sir 8:8 Do not scorn the discourse of the wise, but make yourself familiar with their maxims, since from these
you will learn the theory and the art of serving the great.

Sir 8:9 Do not dismiss what the old people have to say, for they too were taught by their parents; from them you
will learn how to think, and the art of the timely answer.

Sir 8:10 Do not kindle the coals of the sinner, in case you scorch yourself in his blaze.

Sir 8:11 Refuse to be provoked by the insolent, for fear that such a one try to trap you in your words.

Sir 8:12 Do not lend to anyone who is stronger than you are — if you do lend, resign yourself to loss.

Sir 8:13 Do not stand surety beyond your means; if you do stand surety, be prepared to pay up.

Sir 8:14 Do not go to law with a judge, since judgement will be given in his favour.

Sir 8:15 Do not go travelling with a rash man, for fear he becomes burdensome to you; he will act as the whim
takes him, and you will both be ruined by his folly.

Sir 8:16 Do not argue with a quick-tempered man, do not go with him where there are no other people, since
blood counts for nothing in his eyes, and where no help is to be had, he will strike you down.

Sir 8:17 Do not ask a fool for advice, since a fool will not be able to keep a confidence.

Sir 8:18 In a stranger’s presence do nothing that should be kept secret, since you cannot tell what use the
stranger will make of it.

Sir 8:19 Do not open your heart to all comers, nor lay claim to their good offices.

Sir 9:1 Do not be jealous of the wife you love, do not teach her lessons in how to harm you.

Sir 9:2 Do not put yourself in a woman’s hands or she may come to dominate you completely.

Sir 9:3 Do not keep company with a prostitute, in case you get entangled in her snares.

Sir 9:4 Do not dally with a singing girl, in case you get caught by her wiles.

Sir 9:5 Do not stare at a pretty girl, in case you and she incur the same punishment.

Sir 9:6 Do not give your heart to whores, or you will ruin your inheritance.

Sir 9:7 Keep your eyes to yourself in the streets of a town, do not prowl about its unfrequented quarters.

Sir 9:8 Turn your eyes away from a handsome woman, do not stare at a beauty belonging to someöne else.
Because of a woman’s beauty, many have been undone; this makes passion flare up like a fire.

Sir 9:9 Never sit down with a married woman, or sit at table with her drinking wine, in case you let your heart
succumb to her and you lose all self-control and slide to disaster.

Sir 9:10 Do not desert an old friend; the new one will not be his match. New friend, new wine; when it grows old,
you drink it with pleasure.

Sir 9:1 1 Do not envy the sinner his success; you do not know how that will end.



Sir 9:12 Do not take pleasure in what pleases the godless; remember they will not go unpunished here below.

Sir 9:13 Keep your distance from the man who has the power to put to death, and you will not be haunted by the
fear of dying. If you do approach him, make no false move, or he may take your life. Realise that you are
treading among trip-lines, that you are strolling on the battlements.

Sir 9:14 Cultivate your neighbours to the best of your ability, and consult with the wise.

Sir 9:15 For conversation seek the intelligent, let all your discussions bear on the law of the Most High.

Sir 9:16 Have the upright for your table companions, and let your pride be in fearing the Lord.

Sir 9:17 Work from skilled hands will earn its praise, but a leader of the people must be skilful in words.

Sir 9:18 A chatterbox is a terror to his town, a loose talker is detested.

Sir 10:1 A sagacious ruler educates his people, and he makes his subjects understand order.

Sir 10:2 As the magistrate is, so will his officials be, as the governor is, so will be the inhabitants of his city.

Sir 10:3 An undisciplined king will be the ruin of his people, a city owes its prosperity to the intelligence of its
leading men.

Sir 1 0:4 The government of the earth is in the hands of the Lord, he sets the right leader over it at the right time.
Sir 10:5 Human success is in the hands of the Lord. He invests the scribe with honour.

Sir 1 0:6 Do not resent your neighbour’s every offence, and never act in a fit of passion.

Sir 10:7 Pride is hateful to God and humanity, and injustice is abhorrent to both.

Sir 10:8 Sovereignty passes from nation to nation because of injustice, arrogance and money.

Sir 1 0:9 What has dust and ashes to pride itself on? Even in life its entrails are repellent.

Sir 10:10 A long illness makes a fool of the doctor; a king today is a corpse tomorrow.

Sir 10:1 1 For in death the portion of all alike will be insects, wild animals and worms.

Sir 10:12 The first stage of pride is to desert the Lord and to turn one’s heart away from one’s Maker.

Sir 10:13 Since the first stage of pride is sin, whoëver clings to it will pour forth filth. This is why the Lord inflicts
unexpected punishments on such people, utterly destroying them.

Sir 10:14 The Lord has turned mighty princes off their thrones and seated the humble there instead.

Sir 10:15 The Lord has plucked up the proud by the roots, and planted the lowly in their place.

Sir 10:16 The Lord has overthrown the lands of the nations and destroyed them to the very foundations of the
earth.

Sir 10:17 Sometimes he has taken them away and destroyed them, and blotted out their memory from the earth.
Sir 10:18 Pride was not created for human beings, nor furious rage for those born of woman.

Sir 10:19 What race deserves honour? The human race. What race deserves honour? Those who fear the Lord.
What race deserves contempt? The human race. What race deserves contempt? Those who break the Law.

Sir 1 0:20 A leader is honoured by his brothers, and those who fear the Lord are honoured by him.

Sir 10:21

Sir 10:22 The rich, the noble, the poor, let them pride themselves on fearing the Lord.

Sir 1 0:23 It is not right to despise one who is poor but intelligent, and it is not good to honour one who is a
sinner.

Sir 10:24 Magnate, magistrate, potentate, all are to be honoured, but none is greater than the one who fears the
Lord.

Sir 10:25 A wise slave will have free men waiting on him, and the enlightened will not complain.

Sir 1 0:26 Do not try to be smart when you do your work, do not put on airs when you are in difficulties.

Sir 10:27 Better the hardworking who has plenty of everything, than the pretentious at a loss for a meal.

Sir 1 0:28 My child, be modest in your self-esteem, and value yourself at your proper worth.

Sir 1 0:29 Who can justify one who inflicts injuries on himself, or respect one who is full of self-contempt?

Sir 1 0:30 The poor is honoured for wit, and the rich for wealth.

Sir 10:31 Honoured in poverty, how much the more in wealth! Dishonoured in wealth, how much the more in
poverty!

Sir 11:1 Wisdom enables the poor to stand erect, and gives to the poor a place with the great.

Sir 1 1 :2 Do not praise anyone for good looks, nor dislike anyone for mere appearance.

Sir 1 1 :3 Small among winged creatures is the bee but her produce is the sweetest of the sweet.

Sir 1 1 :4 Do not grow proud when people honour you; for the works of the Lord are wonderful but hidden from
human beings.

Sir 1 1 :5 Many monarchs have been made to sit on the ground, and the person nobody thought of has worn the
crown.

Sir 1 1 :6 Many influential people have been utterly disgraced, and prominent people have fallen into the power of
others.

Sir 11:7 Do not find fault before making thorough enquiry; first reflect, then give a reprimand.

Sir 1 1 :8 Listen before you answer, and do not interrupt a speech before it is finished.

Sir 11:9 Do not wrangle about something that does not concern you, do not interfere in the quarrels of sinners.



Sir 11:10 My child, do not take on a great amount of business; if you multiply your interests, you are bound to
suffer for it; hurry as fast as you can, yet you will never arrive, nor will you escape by running away.

Sir 11:11 Some people work very hard at top speed, only to find themselves falling further behind.

Sir 11:12 Or there is the slow kind of person, needing help, poor in possessions and rich in poverty; and the
Lord turns a favourable eye on him, lifts him out of his wretched condition,

Sir 11:13 and enables him to hold his head high, thus causing general astonishment.

Sir 11:14 Good and bad, life and death, poverty and wealth, all come from the Lord.

Sir 11:15
Sir 11:16

Sir 11:17 To the devout the Lord’s gift remains constant, and his favour will be there to lead them for ever.

Sir 11:18 Others grow rich by pinching and scraping, and here is the reward they receive for it:

Sir 1 1:19 although they say, “Now I can sit back and enjoy the benefit of what I have got”, they do not know how
long this will last; they will have to leave their goods to others and die.

Sir 1 1 :20 Stick to your job, work hard at it and grow old at your work.

Sir 1 1 :21 Do not admire the achievements of sinners, trust the Lord and mind your own business; since it is a
trifle in the eyes of the Lord, in a moment, suddenly to make the poor rich.

Sir 1 1 :22 The blessing of the Lord is the reward of the devout, in a moment God brings his blessing to flower.

Sir 1 1 :23 Do not say, “What are my needs, how much shall I have in the future?”.

Sir 1 1 :24 And do not say, “I am self-sufficient, what disaster can affect me now?”.

Sir 1 1 :25 In prosperous times, disasters are forgotten and in times of disaster, no one remembers prosperity.

Sir 1 1 :26 Yet it is a trifle for the Lord on the day someöne dies to repay him as his conduct deserves.

Sir 1 1:27 A moment’s adversity, and pleasures are forgotten; in a person’s last hour his deeds will stand
revealed.

Sir 1 1 :28 Call no one fortunate before his death; it is by his end that someöne will be known.

Sir 1 1 :29 Do not bring everyone home with you, for many are the traps of the crafty.

Sir 1 1 :30 Like a captive partridge in a cage, so is the heart of the proud: like a spy he watches for your downfall,
Sir 1 1 :31 ever on the look-out, turning good into bad and finding fault with what is praiseworthy.

Sir 1 1 :32 A hearthful of glowing coals starts from a single spark, and the sinner lurks for the chance to spill
blood.

Sir 1 1 :33 Beware of a scoundrel and his evil contrivances, in case he puts a smear on you for ever.

Sir 1 1 :34 Give a home to a stranger and he will start trouble and estrange you from your own family.

Sir 12:1 If you mean to do a kindness, choose the right person, then your good deeds will not be wasted.

Sir 12:2 Do good to someöne devout, and you will be rewarded, if not by that person, then certainly by the Most
High.

Sir 12:3 No good will come to one who persists in evil, or who refuses to give alms.

Sir 12:4 Give to the devout, do not go to the help of a sinner.

Sir 12:5 Do good to the humble, give nothing to the godless. Refuse him bread, do not give him any, it might
make him stronger than you are; then you would be repaid evil twice over for all the good you had done him.

Sir 1 2:6 For the Most High himself detests sinners, and will repay the wicked with what they deserve.

Sir 12:7 Give to the good, and do not go to the help of a sinner.

Sir 12:8 In prosperity you cannot always tell a true friend, but in adversity you cannot mistake an enemy.

Sir 12:9 When someöne is doing well that person’s enemies are sad, when someöne is doing badly, even a
friend will keep at a distance.

Sir 12:10 Do not ever trust an enemy; as bronze tarnishes, so does an enemy’s malice.

Sir 12:1 1 Even if he behaves humbly and comes bowing and scraping, maintain your reserve and be on your

guard against him. Behave towards him as if you were polishing a mirror, you will find that his tarnish cannot last.
Sir 12:12 Do not stand him beside you in case he thrusts you out and takes your place. Do not seat him on your
right, or he will be after your position, and then you will remember what I have said and sadly admit that I was
right.

Sir 12:13 Who feels sorry for a snake-charmer bitten by a snake, or for those who take risks with savage
animals? -

Sir 12:14 just so for one who consorts with a sinner, and becomes an accomplice in his sins.

Sir 12:15 He will stay with you for a while, but if you once give way he will press his advantage.

Sir 12:16 An enemy may have sweetness on his lips, and in his heart a scheme to throw you into the ditch. An

enemy may have tears in his eyes, but if he gets a chance there can never be too much blood for him.

Sir 12:17 If you meet with misfortune, you will find him there before you, and, pretending to help you, he will trip
you up.

Sir 12:18 He will wag his head and clap his hands, he will whisper a lot and his expression will change.

Sir 13:1 Whoëver touches pitch will be defiled, and anyone who associates with the proud will come to be like



them.

Sir 13:2 Do not try to carry a burden too heavy for you, do not associate with someöne more powerful and
wealthy than yourself. Why put the clay pot next to the iron cauldron? It will only break when they bang against
each other.

Sir 13:3 The rich does wrong and takes a high line; the poor is wronged and has to beg for pardon.

Sir 1 3:4 If you are useful the rich will exploit you, if you go bankrupt he will desert you.

Sir 13:5 Are you well off? - he will live with you, he will clean you out without a single qualm.

Sir 13:6 Does he need you? - he will hoodwink you, smile at you and raise your hopes; he will speak politely to
you and say, “Is there anything you need?”.

Sir 1 3:7 He will make you feel small at his dinner parties and, having cleaned you out two or three times over,
will end by laughing at you. Afterwards, when he sees you, he will avoid you and shake his head about you.

Sir 13:8 Take care you are not hoodwinked and thus humiliated through your own stupidity.

Sir 13:9 When an influential person invites you, show reluctance, and he will press his invitation all the more.

Sir 13:10 Do not thrust yourself forward, in case you are pushed aside, but do not stand aloof, or you will be
overlooked.

Sir 13:1 1 Do not affect to treat him as an equal, do not trust his flow of words; since all this talking is expressly
meant to test you, under cover of geniality he will be weighing you up.

Sir 13:12 Pitiless is anyone who retails gossip; he will not spare you either blows or chains.

Sir 13:13 Be wary, take very great care, because you are walking with your own downfall.

Sir 13:14

Sir 13:15 Every living thing loves its own sort, and every man his fellow.

Sir 13:16 Every creature mixes with its kind, and human beings stick to their own sort.

Sir 13:17 How can wolf and lamb agree? - Just so with sinner and devout.

Sir 13:18 What peace can there be between hyena and dog? And what peace between rich and poor?

Sir 13:19 Wild desert donkeys are the prey of lions; so too, the poor is the quarry of the rich.

Sir 13:20 The proud thinks humility abhorrent; so too, the rich abominates the poor.

Sir 13:21 When the rich stumbles he is supported by friends; when the poor falls, his friends push him away.

Sir 13:22 When the rich slips, there are many hands to catch him, if he talks nonsense he is congratulated. The
poor slips, and is blamed for it, he may talk good sense, but no room is made for him.

Sir 13:23 The rich speaks and everyone stops talking, and then they praise his discourse to the skies. The poor
speaks and people say, “Who is this?”. and if he stumbles, they trip him up yet more.

Sir 13:24 Wealth is good where there is no sin, poverty is evil, the godless say.

Sir 1 3:25 The heart moulds a person’s expression whether for better or worse.

Sir 13:26 Happy heart, cheerful expression; but wearisome work, inventing proverbs.

Sir 14:1 Blessed is anyone who has not sinned in speech and who needs feel no remorse for sins.

Sir 14:2 Blessed is anyone whose conscience brings no reproach and who has never given up hope.

Sir 14:3 Wealth is not the right thing for the niggardly, and what use are possessions to the covetous?

Sir 14:4 Whoëver hoards by stinting himself is hoarding for others, and others will live sumptuously on his
riches.

Sir 14:5 If someöne is mean to himself, whom does he benefit? he does not even enjoy what is his own.

Sir 14:6 No one is meaner than the person who is mean to himself, this is how his wickedness repays him.

Sir 14:7 If he does any good, he does it unintentionally, and in the end he himself reveals his wickedness.

Sir 14:8 Wicked the person who has an envious eye, averting his face, and careless of others’ lives.

Sir 1 4:9 The eye of the grasping is not content with what he has, greed shrivels up the soul.

Sir 14:10 The miser is grudging of bread, there is famine at his table.

Sir 14:1 1 My child, treat yourself as well as you can afford, and bring worthy offerings to the Lord.

Sir 14:12 Remember that death will not delay, and that you have never seen Sheol’s contract.

Sir 14:13 Be kind to your friend before you die, treat him as generously as you can afford.

Sir 14:14 Do not refuse yourself the good things of today, do not let your share of what is lawfully desired pass
you by.

Sir 14:15 Will you not have to leave your fortune to another, and the fruit of your labour to be divided by lot?

Sir 14:16 Give and receive, enjoy yourself — there are no pleasures to be found in Sheol.

Sir 14:17 Like clothes, every body will wear out, the age — old law is, “Everyone must die”.

Sir 14:18 Like foliage growing on a bushy tree, some leaves falling, others growing, so are the generations of
flesh and blood: one dies, another is born.

Sir 14:19 Every achievement rots away and perishes, and with it goes its author.

Sir 14:20 Blessed is anyone who meditates on wisdom, and reasons with intelligence,

Sir 14:21 who studies her ways in his heart, and ponders her secrets.

Sir 14:22 He pursues her like a hunter, and lies in wait by her path;



Sir 14:23 he peeps in at her windows, and listens at her doors;

Sir 14:24 he lodges close to her house, and fixes his peg in her walls;

Sir 14:25 he pitches his tent at her side, and lodges in an excellent lodging;

Sir 14:26 he sets his children in her shade, and camps beneath her branches;

Sir 14:27 he is sheltered by her from the heat, and in her glory he makes his home.

Sir 15:1 Whoëver fears the Lord will act like this, and whoëver grasps the Law will obtain wisdom.

Sir 15:2 She will come to meet him like a mother, and receive him like a virgin bride.

Sir 15:3 She will give him the bread of understanding to eat, and the water of wisdom to drink.

Sir 15:4 He will lean on her and will not fall, he will rely on her and not be put to shame.

Sir 15:5 She will raise him high above his neighbours, and in full assembly she will open his mouth.

Sir 15:6 He will find happiness and a crown of joy, he will inherit an everlasting name.

Sir 1 5:7 Fools will not gain possession of her, nor will sinners set eyes on her.

Sir 1 5:8 She stands remote from pride, and liars cannot call her to mind.

Sir 15:9 Praise is unseemly in a sinner’s mouth, since it has not been put there by the Lord.

Sir 15:10 For praise should be uttered only in wisdom, and the Lord himself then prompts it.

Sir 15:1 1 Do not say, “The Lord was responsible for my sinning”, for he does not do what he hates.

Sir 15:12 Do not say, “It was he who led me astray”, for he has no use for a sinner.

Sir 15:13 The Lord hates all that is foul, and no one who fears him will love it either.

Sir 15:14 He himself made human beings in the beginning, and then left them free to make their own decisions.
Sir 15:15 If you choose, you will keep the commandments and so be faithful to his will.

Sir 15:16 He has set fire and water before you; put out your hand to whichever you prefer.

Sir 15:17 A human being has life and death before him; whichever he prefers will be given him.

Sir 15:18 For vast is the wisdom of the Lord; he is almighty and all-seeing.

Sir 15:19 His eyes are on those who fear him, he notes every human action.

Sir 15:20 He never commanded anyone to be godless, he has given no one permission to sin.

Sir 16:1 Do not long fora brood of worthless children, and do not take pleasure in godless sons.

Sir 1 6:2 However many you have, take no pleasure in them, unless the fear of the Lord lives among them.

Sir 16:3 Do not count on their having long life, do not put too much faith in their number; for better have one
than a thousand, better die childless than have children who are godless.

Sir 1 6:4 One person of sense can populate a city, but a race of lawless people will be destroyed.

Sir 16:5 My eyes have seen many such things, my ears have heard things even more impressive.

Sir 16:6 Fire is kindled in a sinful society, Retribution blazes in a rebellious nation.

Sir 1 6:7 God did not pardon the giants of old who, confident in their strength, had rebelled.

Sir 16:8 He did not spare the people with whom Lot lived; he abhorred them, rather, for their pride.

Sir 16:9 He was pitiless to the nation of perdition — those people who gloried in their sins-

Sir 16:10 as also to the six hundred thousand men on the march, who had banded together in their obstinacy.

Sir 16:1 1 And had there been only one man stubborn, it would have been amazing had he escaped unpunished,
since mercy and wrath alike belong to the Lord who is mighty to forgive and to pour out wrath.

Sir 16:12 As great as his mercy, so is his severity; he judges each person as his deeds deserve:

Sir 16:13 the sinner will not escape with his ill-gotten gains nor the patience of the devout go for nothing.

Sir 16:14 He takes note of every charitable action, and everyone is treated as he deserves.

Sir 16:15
Sir 16:16

Sir 16:17 Do not say, “I shall hide from the Lord; who is going to remember me up there? I shall not be noticed
among so many people; what am I in the immensity of creation?”.

Sir 16:18 For see, the sky and the heavens above the sky, the abyss and the earth shake at his visitation.

Sir 16:19 The mountains and earth’s foundations alike quail and tremble when he looks at them.

Sir 16:20 But to all this no one gives thought. Who keeps his movements in mind?

Sir 16:21 The storm wind itself is invisible, and most of what he does goes undetected.

Sir 16:22 “Who will report whether justice has been done? Who will be watching? The covenant is remote!”.

Sir 1 6:23 Such are the thoughts of the person of little sense, stupid, misguided, cherishing his folly.

Sir 16:24 Listen to me, my child, and learn knowledge, and give your whole mind to my words.

Sir 16:25 I shall expound discipline methodically and proclaim knowledge with precision.

Sir 16:26 When God created his works in the beginning, he assigned them their places as soon as they were
made.

Sir 16:27 He determined his works for all time, from their origins to their distant generations. They know neither
hunger nor weariness, and they never desert their duties.

Sir 1 6:28 Not one has ever got in the way of another, and they will never disobey his word.

Sir 16:29 And afterwards the Lord looked at the earth, and filled it with his good things.



Sir 1 6:30 He covered its surface with every kind of animal, and to it they will return.

Sir 17:1 The Lord fashioned human beings from the earth, to consign them back to it.

Sir 17:2 He gave them so many days and so much time, he gave them authority over everything on earth.

Sir 17:3 He clothed them in strength, like himself, and made them in his own image.

Sir 17:4 He filled all living things with dread of human beings, making them masters over beasts and birds.

Sir 17:5

Sir 17:6 He made them a tongue, eyes and ears, and gave them a heart to think with.

Sir 17:7 He filled them with knowledge and intelligence, and showed them what was good and what evil.

Sir 17:8 He put his own light in their hearts to show them the magnificence of his works,

Sir 17:9

Sir 17:10 so that they would praise his holy name as they told of his magnificent works.

Sir 17:1 1 He set knowledge before them, he endowed them with the law of life.

Sir 17:12 He established an eternal covenant with them, and revealed his judgements to them.

Sir 17:13 Their eyes saw the majesty of his glory, and their ears heard the glory of his voice.

Sir 17:14 He said to them, “Beware of all wrong-doing”; he gave each a commandment concerning his
neighbour.

Sir 17:15 Their ways are always under his eye, they cannot be hidden from his sight.

Sir 17:16

Sir 17:17 Over each nation he has set a governor, but Israel is the Lord’s own portion.

Sir 17:18

Sir 17:19 Their actions are all as plain as the sun to him, and his eyes rest constantly on their conduct.

Sir 17:20 Their iniquities are not hidden from him, all their sins are before the Lord.

Sir 17:21

Sir 17:22 Almsgiving is like a signet ring to him, he cherishes generosity like the pupil of an eye.

Sir 17:23 One day he will rise and reward them, he will repay their deserts on their own heads.

Sir 17:24 But to those who repent he permits return, and he encourages those who have lost hope.

Sir 17:25 Return to the Lord and renounce your sins, plead before his face, stop offending him.

Sir 17:26 Come back to the Most High, turn away from iniquity and hold all that is foul in abhorrence.

Sir 17:27 Who is going to praise the Most High in Sheol if we do not glorify him while we are alive?

Sir 17:28 The dead can praise no more than those who do not exist, only those with life and health can praise
the Lord.

Sir 17:29 How great is the mercy of the Lord, his pardon for those who turn to him!

Sir 17:30 For we cannot have everything, human beings are not immortal.

Sir 17:31 What is brighter than the sun? And yet it fades. Flesh and blood think of nothing but evil.

Sir 17:32 He surveys the armies of the lofty sky, and all of us are only dust and ashes.

Sir 18:1 He who lives for ever has created the sum of things.

Sir 18:2 The Lord alone will be found just.

Sir 18:3

Sir 18:4 He has given no one the power to proclaim his works to the end, and who can fathom his magnificent
deeds?

Sir 18:5 Who can assess his magnificent strength, and who can go further and tell all of his mercies?

Sir 18:6 Nothing can be added to them, nothing subtracted, it is impossible to fathom the marvels of the Lord.

Sir 18:7 When someöne finishes he is only beginning, and when he stops he is as puzzled as ever.

Sir 18:8 What is a human being, what purpose does he serve? What is good and what is bad for him?

Sir 18:9 The length of his life: a hundred years at most.

Sir 18:10 Like a drop of water from the sea, or a grain of sand, such are these few years compared with eternity.
Sir 18:1 1 This is why the Lord is patient with them and pours out his mercy on them.

Sir 18:12 He sees and recognises how wretched their end is, and so he makes his forgiveness the greater.

Sir 18:13 Human compassion extends to neighbours, but the Lord’s compassion extends to everyone; rebuking,
correcting and teaching, bringing them back as a shepherd brings his flock.

Sir 18:14 He has compassion on those who accept correction, and who fervently search for his judgements.

Sir 18:15 My child, do not temper your favours with blame nor any of your gifts with words that hurt.

Sir 18:16 Does not dew relieve the heat? In the same way a word is worth more than a gift.

Sir 18:17 Why surely, a word is better than a good present, but a generous person is ready with both.

Sir 18:18 A fool will offer nothing but insult, and a grudging gift makes the eyes smart.

Sir 18:19 Learn before you speak, take care of yourself before you fall ill.

Sir 1 8:20 Examine yourself before judgement comes, and on the day of visitation you will be acquitted.

Sir 18:21 Humble yourself before you fall ill, repent as soon as the sin is committed.

Sir 18:22 Let nothing prevent your discharging a vow in good time, and do not wait until death to set matters right.



Sir 18:23 Prepare yourself before making a vow, and do not be like someöne who tempts the Lord.

Sir 18:24 Bear in mind the retribution of the last days, the time of vengeance when God averts his face.

Sir 1 8:25 In a time of plenty remember times of famine, think of poverty and want when you are rich.

Sir 1 8:26 The time slips by between dawn and dusk, everything passes quickly for the Lord.

Sir 18:27 The wise will be cautious in everything, in sinful times will take care not to offend.

Sir 18:28 Every person of sense recognises wisdom, and will respect anyone who has found her.

Sir 18:29 Those who understand sayings have toiled for their wisdom and have poured out accurate maxims.

Sir 18:30 Do not be governed by your passions, restrain your desires.

Sir 1 8:31 If you allow yourself to satisfy your desires, this will make you the laughing-stock of your enemies.

Sir 18:32 Do not indulge in luxurious living, do not get involved in such society.

Sir 18:33 Do not beggar yourself by banqueting on credit when there is nothing in your pocket.

Sir 19:1 A drunken workman will never grow rich, and one who makes light of small matters will gradually sink.
Sir 19:2 Wine and women corrupt intelligent men, the customer of whores loses all sense of shame.

Sir 19:3 Grubs and worms will have him as their legacy, and the man who knows no shame will lose his life.

Sir 19:4 Being too ready to trust shows shallowness of mind, and sinning harms the sinner.

Sir 19:5 Taking pleasure in evil earns condemnation;

Sir 19:6 by hating gossip one avoids evil.

Sir 19:7 Never repeat what you are told and you will come to no harm;

Sir 1 9:8 whether to friend or foe, do not talk about it, unless it would be sinful not to, do not reveal it;

Sir 19:9 you would be heard out, then mistrusted, and in due course you would be hated.

Sir 19:10 Have you heard something? Let it die with you. Courage! It will not burst you!

Sir 19:1 1 A fool will suffer birthpangs over a piece of news, like a woman labouring with child.

Sir 19:12 Like an arrow stuck in the flesh of the thigh, so is a piece of news inside a fool.

Sir 19:13 Question your friend, he may have done nothing at all; and if he has done anything, he will not do it
again.

Sir 19:14 Question your neighbour, he may have said nothing at all; and if he has said anything, he will not say
it again.

Sir 19:15 Question your friend, for slander is very common, do not believe all you hear.

Sir 19:16 People sometimes make a slip, without meaning what they say; and which of us has never sinned by
speech?

Sir 19:17 Question your neighbour before you threaten him, and defer to the Law of the Most High.

Sir 19:18
Sir 19:19

Sir 19:20 Wisdom consists entirely in fearing the Lord, and wisdom is entirely constituted by the fulfilling of the
Law.

Sir 19:21

Sir 19:22 Being learned in evil, however, is not wisdom, there is no prudence in the advice of sinners.

Sir 19:23 There is a cleverness that is detestable; whoëver has no wisdom is a fool.

Sir 1 9:24 Better be short of sense and full of fear, than abound in shrewdness and violate the Law.

Sir 19:25 There is a wickedness which is scrupulous but nonetheless dishonest, and there are those who
misuse kindness to win their case.

Sir 19:26 There is the person who will walk bowed down with grief, when inwardly this is nothing but deceit:

Sir 19:27 he hides his face and pretends to be deaf, if he is not unmasked, he will take advantage of you.

Sir 19:28 There is the person who is prevented from sinning by lack of strength, yet he will do wrong when he
gets the chance.

Sir 19:29 You can tell a person by his appearance, you can tell a thinker by the look on his face.

Sir 19:30 The way a person dresses, the way he laughs, the way he walks, tell you what he is.

Sir 20:1 There is the rebuke that is untimely, and there is the person who keeps quiet, and he is the shrewd one.
Sir 20:2 But how much better to rebuke than to fume!

Sir 20:3 The person who acknowledges a fault wards off punishment.

Sir 20:4 Like a eunuch trying to take a girl’s virginity is someöne who tries to impose justice by force.

Sir 20:5 There is the person who keeps quiet and is considered wise, another incurs hatred for talking too much.
Sir 20:6 There is the person who keeps quiet, not knowing how to answer, another keeps quiet, knowing when
to speak.

Sir 20:7 The wise will keep quiet until the right moment, but a garrulous fool will always misjudge it.

Sir 20:8 Someöne who talks too much will earn dislike, and someöne who usurps authority will earn hatred.

Sir 20:9 There is the person who finds misfortune a boon, and the piece of luck that turns to loss.

Sir 20:10 There is the gift that affords you no profit, and the gift that repays you double.

Sir 20:1 1 There is the honour that leads to humiliation, and there are people in a low state who raise their



heads.

Sir 20:12 There is the person who buys much for little, yet pays for it seven times over.

Sir 20:13 The wise wins love with words, while fools may shower favours in vain.

Sir 20:14 The gift of the stupid will bring you no advantage, his eyes look for seven times as much in return.

Sir 20:15 He gives little and reviles much, he opens his mouth like the town crier, he lends today and demands
payment tomorrow; he is a detestable fellow.

Sir 20:16 The fool will say, “I have no friends, I get no gratitude for my good deeds;

Sir 20:17 those who eat my bread have malicious tongues”. How often he will be laughed at, and by how many!
Sir 20:18 Better a slip on the pavement than a slip of the tongue; this is how ruin takes the wicked by surprise.
Sir 20:19 A coarse-grained person is like an indiscreet story endlessly retold by the ignorant.

Sir 20:20 A maxim is rejected when coming from a fool, since the fool does not utter it on the apt occasion.

Sir 20:21 There is a person who is prevented from sinning by poverty; no qualms of conscience disturb that
person’s rest.

Sir 20:22 There is a person who courts destruction out of false shame, courts destruction for the sake of a fool’s
opinion.

Sir 20:23 There is a person who out of false shame makes promises to a friend, and so makes an enemy for
nothing.

Sir 20:24 Lying is an ugly blot on anyone, and ever on the lips of the undisciplined.

Sir 20:25 A thief is preferable to an inveterate liar, but both are heading for ruin.

Sir 20:26 Lying is an abominable habit, the liar’s disgrace lasts for ever.

Sir 20:27 The wise gains advancement by words, the shrewd wins favour from the great.

Sir 20:28 Whoëver tills the soil will have a full harvest, whoëver wins favour from the great will secure pardon for
offences.

Sir 20:29 Presents and gifts blind the eyes of the wise and stifle rebukes like a muzzle on the mouth.

Sir 20:30 Wisdom concealed, and treasure undiscovered, what use is either of these?

Sir 20:31 Better one who conceals his folly than one who conceals his wisdom.

Sir 21:1 My child, have you sinned? Do so no more, and ask forgiveness for your previous faults.

Sir 21 :2 Flee from sin as from a snake, if you approach it, it will bite you; its teeth are lion’s teeth, they take
human life away.

Sir 21 :3 All law-breaking is like a two-edged sword, the wounds it inflicts are beyond cure.

Sir 21 :4 Terror and violence make havoc of riches, similarly, desolation overtakes the houses of the proud.

Sir 21 :5 A plea from the mouth of the poor goes straight to the ear of God, whose judgement comes without
delay.

Sir 21 :6 Whoëver resents reproof walks in the sinner’s footsteps; whoëver fears the Lord is repentant of heart.
Sir 21 :7 The glib speaker is known far and wide, but the wary detects every slip.

Sir 21 :8 To build your house with other people’s money is like collecting stones for your own tomb.

Sir 21 :9 A meeting of the lawless is like a heap of tow: they will end in a blazing fire.

Sir 21:10 The sinner’s road is smoothly paved, but it ends at the pit of Sheol.

Sir 21:11 Whoëver keeps the Law will master his instincts; the fear of the Lord is made perfect in wisdom.

Sir 21:12 No one who lacks aptitude can be taught, but certain aptitudes give rise to bitterness.

Sir 21:1 3 The sage’s knowledge is as rich as the abyss and his advice is like a living spring.

Sir 21:14 The heart of a fool is like a broken jar, it will not hold any knowledge.

Sir 21:1 5 If the educated hears a wise saying, he praises it and caps it with another; if a debauchee hears it, he
does not like it and tosses it behind his back.

Sir 21:16 The talk of a fool is like a load on a journey, but it is a pleasure to listen to the intelligent.

Sir 21:1 7 The utterance of the shrewd will be eagerly awaited in the assembly, what he says will be given
serious consideration.

Sir 21:18 The wisdom of a fool is like the wreckage of a house, the knowledge of a dolt is incoherent talk.

Sir 21:19 To the senseless fellow instruction is like fetters on the feet, like manacles on the right hand.

Sir 21 :20 A fool laughs at the top of his voice, but the intelligent quietly smiles.

Sir 21 :21 To the shrewd instruction is like a golden ornament, like a bracelet on the right arm.

Sir 21 :22 The step of a fool goes straight into a house, but a person of much experience makes a respectful
approach;

Sir 21 :23 the stupid peeps inside through the door, a well-bred person waits outside.

Sir 21 :24 Listening at doors is a sign of bad upbringing, the perceptive would be ashamed to do so.

Sir 21 :25 The lips of gossips repeat the words of others, the words of the wise are carefully weighed.

Sir 21 :26 The heart of fools is in their mouth, but the mouth of the wise is in their heart.

Sir 21 :27 When the godless curses Satan, he is cursing himself.

Sir 21 :28 The scandal-monger sullies himself and earns the hatred of the neighbourhood.



Sir 22:1 An idler is like a stone covered in filth, everyone whistles at his disgrace.

Sir 22:2 An idler is like a lump of dung, anyone picking it up shakes it off his hand.

Sir 22:3 It is a disgrace to have fathered a badly brought-up son, but the birth of any daughter is a loss;

Sir 22:4 a sensible daughter will find a husband, but a shameless one is a grief to her father.

Sir 22:5 A brazen daughter puts father and mother to shame, and will be disowned by both.

Sir 22:6 An untimely remonstrance is like music at a funeral, but a thrashing and correction are wisdom at all
times.

Sir 22:7
Sir 22:8

Sir 22:9 Teaching a fool is like gluing bits of pottery together — you are rousing someöne who is besotted with
sleep.

Sir 22:10 You might as well talk to someöne sound asleep; when you have finished the fool will say, “What’s
up?”.

Sir 22:1 1 Shed tears for the dead, who has left the light behind; shed tears for the fool, who has left his wits
behind. Shed quieter tears for the dead who is at rest, for the fool life is worse than death.

Sir 22:12 Mourning for the dead lasts seven days, for the foolish and ungodly all the days of their lives.

Sir 22:13 Do not waste many words on the stupid, do not go near a dolt. Beware of him, or you will have trouble
and be soiled by contact with him; keep away from him, and you will have peace of mind and not be exasperated
by his folly.

Sir 22:14 What is heavier than lead, and what is its name if not “fool'?

Sir 22:15 Sand and salt and a lump of iron are a lighter burden than a dolt.

Sir 22:16 A tie-beam bonded into a building will not be dislodged by an earthquake; so too, a heart resolved
after due reflection will not flinch at the critical moment.

Sir 22:17 A heart founded on intelligent reflection is like a stucco decoration on a smooth wall.

Sir 22:18 Pebbles placed on top of a wall will not stand up to the wind; no more can the heart of a fool frightened

at his own thoughts stand up to fear.

Sir 22:19 Prick an eye and you will draw a tear, prick a heart and you reveal its feelings.

Sir 22:20 Throw stones at birds and you scare them away, reproach a friend and you destroy a friendship.

Sir 22:21 If you have drawn your sword on a friend, do not despair; there is a way back.

Sir 22:22 If you have opened your mouth against your friend, do not worry; there is hope for reconciliation; but
insult, arrogance, betrayal of secrets, and the stab in the back — in these cases any friend is lost.

Sir 22:23 Win your neighbour’s confidence when he is poor, so that you may enjoy his later good fortune with
him; stand by him in times of trouble, in order to have your share when he comes into a legacy.

Sir 22:24 Fire is heralded by the reek of the furnace and smoke, so too, bloodshed by insults.

Sir 22:25 I shall not be ashamed to shelter a friend nor shall I hide away from him,

Sir 22:26 and if evil comes to me through him, everyone who hears about it will beware of him.

Sir 22:27 Who will set a guard on my mouth, and an efficient seal on my lips, to keep me from falling, and my
tongue from causing my ruin?

Sir 23:1 Lord, father and master of my life, do not abandon me to their whims, do not let me fall because of
them.

Sir 23:2 Who will lay whips to my thoughts, and the discipline of wisdom to my heart, to be merciless to my
errors and not let my sins go unchecked,

Sir 23:3 for fear my errors should multiply and my sins then abound and I fall before my adversaries, and my
enemy gloat over me?

Sir 23:4 Lord, father and God of my life, do not let my eyes be proud,

Sir 23:5 turn envy away from me,

Sir 23:6 do not let lechery and lust grip me, do not leave me a prey to shameless desire.

Sir 23:7 Children, listen to what I teach, no one who keeps it will be caught out.

Sir 23:8 The sinner is ensnared by his own lips, both the abusive and the proud are tripped by them.

Sir 23:9 Do not get into the habit of swearing, do not make a habit of naming the Holy One;

Sir 23:10 for just as a slave who is constantly overseen will never be without bruises, so someöne who is always
swearing and uttering the Name will not be exempt from sin.

Sir 23:1 1 A man for ever swearing is full of iniquity, and the scourge will not depart from his house. If he offends,
his sin will be on him, if he did it unheedingly, he has doubly sinned; if he swears a false oath, he will not be
treated as innocent, for his house will be filled with calamities.

Sir 23:12 One way of talking is like death, let it not be found in the heritage of Jacob since devout people have
nothing to do with that: they will not wallow in sin.

Sir 23:13 Do not get into the habit of using coarse and foul language since this involves sinful words.

Sir 23:14 Remember your father and mother when you are sitting with the great, for fear you forget yourself in



their presence and behave like a fool, and then wish you had not been born and curse the day of your birth.

Sir 23:15 No one in the habit of using shameful language will break himself of it as long as he lives.

Sir 23:16 There are two types of people who commit sin after sin and a third who attracts retribution-
Sir 23:17 desire, blazing like a furnace, will not die down until it has been sated- the man who lusts after
members of his own family is not going to stop until he is quite burnt out; every food is sweet to the promiscuous,
and he will not desist until he dies;

Sir 23:18 and the man who sins against the marriage bed and says to himself, “Who can see me? There is
darkness all round me, the walls hide me, no one can see me, why should I worry? The Most High will not
remember my sins”.

Sir 23:19 What he fears are human eyes, he does not realise that the eyes of the Lord are ten thousand times
brighter than the sun, observing every aspect of human behaviour, seeing into the most secret corners.

Sir 23:20 All things were known to him before they were created, and are still, now that they are finished.

Sir 23:21 This man will be punished in view of the whole town, and will be seized when he least expects it.

Sir 23:22 Similarly the woman unfaithful to her husband, who provides him with an heir by another man:

Sir 23:23 first, she has disobeyed the Law of the Most High; secondly, she has been false to her husband; and
thirdly, she has gone whoring in adultery

Sir 23:24 and conceived children by another man. She will be led before the assembly, an enquiry will be held
about her children.

Sir 23:25 Her children will strike no root, her branches will bear no fruit.

Sir 23:26 She will leave an accursed memory behind her, her shame will never be wiped out.

Sir 23:27 And those who survive her will recognise that nothing is better than fearing the Lord, and nothing
sweeter than adherence to the Lord’s commandments.

Sir 24:1 Wisdom speaks her own praises, in the midst of her people she glories in herself.

Sir 24:2 She opens her mouth in the assembly of the Most High, she glories in herself in the presence of the
Mighty One:

Sir 24:3 “I came forth from the mouth of the Most High, and I covered the earth like mist.

Sir 24:4 I had my tent in the heights, and my throne was a pillar of cloud.

Sir 24:5 Alone, I have made the circuit of the heavens and walked through the depths of the abyss.

Sir 24:6 Over the waves of the sea and over the whole earth, and over every people and nation I have held
sway.

Sir 24:7 Among all these I searched for rest, and looked to see in whose territory I might pitch camp.

Sir 24:8 Then the Creator of all things instructed me and he who created me fixed a place for my tent. He said,
‘Pitch your tent in Jacob, make Israel your inheritance’.

Sir 24:9 From eternity, in the beginning, he created me, and for eternity I shall remain.

Sir 24:10 In the holy tent I ministered before him and thus became established in Zion.

Sir 24:1 1 In the beloved city he has given me rest, and in Jerusalem I wield my authority.

Sir 24:12 I have taken root in a privileged people, in the Lord’s property, in his inheritance.

Sir 24:13 I have grown tall as a cedar on Lebanon, as a cypress on Mount Hermon;

Sir 24:14 I have grown tall as a palm in En-Gedi, as the rose bushes of Jericho; as a fine olive in the plain, as a
plane tree, I have grown tall.

Sir 24:15 Like cinnamon and acanthus, I have yielded a perfume, like choice myrrh, have breathed out a scent,
like galbanum, onycha, labdanum, like the smoke of incense in the tent.

Sir 24:16 I have spread my branches like a terebinth, and my branches are glorious and graceful.

Sir 24:17 I am like a vine putting out graceful shoots, my blossoms bear the fruit of glory and wealth.

Sir 24:18

Sir 24:19 Approach me, you who desire me, and take your fill of my fruits,

Sir 24:20 for memories of me are sweeter than honey, inheriting me is sweeter than the honeycomb.

Sir 24:21 They who eat me will hunger for more, they who drink me will thirst for more.

Sir 24:22 No one who obeys me will ever have to blush, no one who acts as I dictate will ever sin”.

Sir 24:23 All this is no other than the Book of the Covenant of the Most High God, the Law that Moses enjoined
on us, an inheritance for the communities of Jacob.

Sir 24:24

Sir 24:25 This is what makes wisdom brim over like the Pishon, like the Tigris in the season of fruit,

Sir 24:26 what makes intelligence overflow like the Euphrates, like the Jordan at harvest time;

Sir 24:27 and makes discipline flow like the Nile, like the Gihon when the grapes are harvested.

Sir 24:28 The first man did not finish discovering about her, nor has the most recent tracked her down;

Sir 24:29 for her thoughts are wider than the sea, and her designs more profound than the abyss.

Sir 24:30 And I, like a conduit from a river, like a watercourse running into a garden,

Sir 24:31 I said, “I am going to water my orchard, I intend to irrigate my flower beds”. And see, my conduit has



grown into a river, and my river has grown into a sea.

Sir 24:32 Making discipline shine forth from daybreak, I shall send its light far and wide.

Sir 24:33 I shall pour out teaching like prophecy, as a legacy to all future generations.

Sir 24:34 And note, I have been working not merely for myself, but for all who are seeking wisdom.

Sir 25:1 There are three things my soul delights in, and which are delightful to God and to all people: concord
between brothers, friendship between neighbours, and a wife and husband who live happily together.

Sir 25:2 There are three sorts of people my soul hates, and whose existence I consider an outrage: the poor
swollen with pride, the rich who is a liar and an adulterous old man who has no sense.

Sir 25:3 If you have gathered nothing in your youth, how can you discover anything in your old age?

Sir 25:4 How fine a thing: sound judgement with grey hairs, and for greybeards to know how to advise!

Sir 25:5 How fine a thing: wisdom in the aged, and considered advice coming from people of distinction!

Sir 25:6 The crown of the aged is ripe experience, their glory, the fear of the Lord.

Sir 25:7 There are nine things I can think of which strike me as happy, and a tenth which is now on my tongue:
the man who can be proud of his children, he who lives to see the downfall of his enemies;

Sir 25:8 happy is he who keeps house with a sensible wife; he who does not toil with ox and donkey; he who
has never sinned with his tongue; he who does not serve a man less worthy than himself;

Sir 25:9 happy is he who has acquired good sense and can find attentive ears for what he has to say;

Sir 25:10 how great is he who has acquired wisdom; but unsurpassed is one who fears the Lord.

Sir 25:1 1 The fear of the Lord surpasses everything; what can compare with someöne who has mastered that?
Sir 25:12

Sir 25:13 Any wound rather than a wound of the heart! Any spite rather than the spite of woman!

Sir 25:14 Any evil rather than an evil caused by an enemy! Any vengeance rather than the vengeance of a foe!
Sir 25:15 There is no poison worse than the poison of a snake, there is no fury worse than the fury of an enemy.
Sir 25:16 I would sooner keep house with a lion or a dragon than keep house with a spiteful wife.

Sir 25:17 A woman’s spite changes her appearance and makes her face as grim as a bear’s.

Sir 25:18 When her husband goes out to dinner with his neighbours, he cannot help heaving bitter sighs.

Sir 25:19 No spite can approach the spite of a woman, may a sinner’s lot be hers!

Sir 25:20 Like the climbing of a sandhill for elderly feet, such is a garrulous wife for a quiet husband.

Sir 25:21 Do not be taken in by a woman’s beauty, never lose your head over a woman.

Sir 25:22 Bad temper, insolence and shame hold sway where the wife supports the husband.

Sir 25:23 Low spirits, gloomy face, stricken heart: such is a spiteful wife. Slack hands and sagging knees: such
is the wife who does not make her husband happy.

Sir 25:24 Sin began with a woman, and thanks to her we must all die.

Sir 25:25 Do not let water find a leak, nor a spiteful woman give free rein to her tongue.

Sir 25:26 If she will not do as you tell her, get rid of her.

Sir 26:1 How blessed is the husband of a really good wife; the number of his days will be doubled.

Sir 26:2 A perfect wife is the joy of her husband, he will live out the years of his life in peace.

Sir 26:3 A good wife is the best of portions, reserved for those who fear the Lord;

Sir 26:4 rich or poor, their hearts will be glad, their faces cheerful, whatever the season.

Sir 26:5 There are three things that I dread, and a fourth which terrifies me: slander by a whole town, the
gathering of a mob, and a false accusation — these are all worse than death;

Sir 26:6 but a woman jealous of a woman means heartbreak and sorrow, and all this is the scourge of the
tongue.

Sir 26:7 A bad wife is a badly fitting ox-yoke, trying to master her is like grasping a scorpion.

Sir 26:8 A drunken wife will goad anyone to fury, she cannot conceal her own degradation.

Sir 26:9 A woman’s wantonness shows in her wide-eyed look, her eyelashes leave no doubt.

Sir 26:10 Keep a headstrong daughter under firm control, or, feeling free, she will take advantage of it.

Sir 26:1 1 Keep a strict watch on her shameless eye, do not be surprised if she disgraces you.

Sir 26:12 Like a thirsty traveller she will open her mouth and drink any water she comes across; she will sit
down in front of every tent-peg and open her quiver to any arrow.

Sir 26:13 The grace of a wife will charm her husband, her understanding will make him the stronger.

Sir 26:14 A silent wife is a gift from the Lord, no price can be put on a well-trained character.

Sir 26:15 A modest wife is a boon twice over, a chaste character cannot be over-valued.

Sir 26:16 Like the sun rising over the mountains of the Lord, such is the beauty of a good wife in a well-run
house.

Sir 26:17 Like a lamp shining on the sacred lamp-stand, such is a beautiful face on a well-proportioned body.

Sir 26:18 Like golden pillars on a silver base, such are shapely legs on firm-set heels.

Sir 26:19
Sir 26:20



Sir 26:21
Sir 26:22
Sir 26:23
Sir 26:24
Sir 26:25
Sir 26:26
Sir 26:27

Sir 26:28 There are two things which grieve my heart and a third arouses my anger: a warrior wasting away
through poverty, the intelligent treated with contempt, someöne turning back from virtue to sin — the Lord marks
out such a person for a violent death.

Sir 26:29 It is difficult for a merchant to avoid doing wrong and for a trader not to incur sin.

Sir 27:1 Many have sinned for the sake of profit, one who hopes to be rich must turn a blind eye.

Sir 27:2 A peg will stick in the joint between two stones, and sin will wedge itself between selling and buying.

Sir 27:3 Whoëver does not firmly hold to the fear of the Lord, his house will soon be overthrown.

Sir 27:4 In a shaken sieve the rubbish is left behind, so too the defects of a person appear in speech.

Sir 27:5 The kiln tests the work of the potter, the test of a person is in conversation.

Sir 27:6 The orchard where the tree grows is judged by its fruit, similarly words betray what a person feels.

Sir 27:7 Do not praise anyone who has not yet spoken, since this is where people are tested.

Sir 27:8 If you pursue virtue, you will attain it and put it on like a festal gown.

Sir 27:9 Birds consort with their kind, truth comes home to those who practise it.

Sir 27:10 The lion lies in wait for its prey, so does sin for those who do wrong.

Sir 27:1 1 The conversation of the devout is wisdom at all times, but the fool is as changeable as the moon.

Sir 27:12 When visiting stupid people, choose the right moment, but among the thoughtful take your time.

Sir 27:13 The conversation of fools is disgusting, raucous their laughter in their sinful pleasures.

Sir 27:14 The talk of hard-swearing people makes your hair stand on end, their brawling makes you stop your
ears.

Sir 27:15 A quarrel between the proud leads to bloodshed, and their insults are embarrassing to hear.

Sir 27:16 A betrayer of secrets forfeits all trust and will never find the kind of friend he wants.

Sir 27:17 Be fond of a friend and keep faith with him, but if you have betrayed his secrets, do not go after him
any more;

Sir 27:18 for, as one destroys a person by killing him, so you have killed your neighbour’s friendship,

Sir 27:19 and as you let a bird slip through your fingers, so you have let your friend go, and will not catch him.

Sir 27:20 Do not go after him - he is far away, he has fled like a gazelle from the snare.

Sir 27:21 For a wound can be bandaged and abuse forgiven, but for the betrayer of a secret there is no hope.

Sir 27:22 Someöne with a sly wink is plotting mischief, no one can dissuade him from it.

Sir 27:23 Honey-tongued to your face, he is lost in admiration at your words; but behind your back he has other
things to say, and turns your words into a stumbling-block.

Sir 27:24 I have found many things to hate, but nothing as much as him, and the Lord hates him too.

Sir 27:25 Whoëver throws a stone in the air, throws it on to his own head; a treacherous blow cuts both ways.

Sir 27:26 The man who digs a pit falls into it, whoëver sets a snare will be caught by it.

Sir 27:27 On anyone who does evil, evil will recoil, without his knowing where it comes from.

Sir 27:28 Sarcasm and abuse are the mark of the arrogant, but vengeance lies in wait like a lion for such a one.
Sir 27:29 The trap will close on all who rejoice in the downfall of the devout, and pain will eat them up before
they die.

Sir 27:30 Resentment and anger, these are foul things too, and a sinner is a master at them both.

Sir 28:1 Whoëver exacts vengeance will experience the vengeance of the Lord, who keeps strict account of sin.
Sir 28:2 Pardon your neighbour any wrongs done to you, and when you pray, your sins will be forgiven.

Sir 28:3 If anyone nurses anger against another, can one then demand compassion from the Lord?

Sir 28:4 Showing no pity for someöne like oneself, can one then plead for one’s own sins?

Sir 28:5 Mere creature of flesh, yet cherishing resentment!-who will forgive one for sinning?

Sir 28:6 Remember the last things, and stop hating, corruption and death, and be faithful to the commandments.
Sir 28:7 Remember the commandments, and do not bear your fellow ill-will, remember the covenant of the Most
High, and ignore the offence.

Sir 28:8 Avoid quarrelling and you will sin less; for the hot-tempered provokes quarrels,

Sir 28:9 a sinner sows trouble between friends, introducing discord among the peaceful.

Sir 28:10 The way a fire burns depends on its fuel, a quarrel spreads in proportion to its violence; a man’s rage
depends on his strength, his fury grows fiercer in proportion to his wealth.

Sir 28:1 1 A sudden quarrel kindles fire, a hasty dispute leads to bloodshed.

Sir 28:12 Blow on a spark and up it flares, spit on it and out it goes; both are the effects of your mouth.



Sir 28:13 A curse on the scandal-monger and double-talker, such a person has ruined many who lived in
concord.

Sir 28:14 That third tongue has shattered the peace of many and driven them from nation to nation; it has pulled
down fortified cities, and overthrown the houses of the great.

Sir 28:15 The third tongue has had upright wives divorced, depriving them of reward for their hard work.

Sir 28:16 No one who listens to it will ever know peace of mind, will ever live in peace again.

Sir 28:17 A stroke of the whip raises a weal, but a stroke of the tongue breaks bones.

Sir 28:18 Many have fallen by the edge of the sword, but many more have fallen by the tongue.

Sir 28:19 Blessed is anyone who has been sheltered from it, and has not experienced its fury, who has not
dragged its yoke about, or been bound in its chains;

Sir 28:20 for its yoke is an iron yoke, its chains are bronze chains;

Sir 28:21 the death it inflicts is a miserable death, Sheol is preferable to it.

Sir 28:22 It cannot gain a hold over the devout, they are not burnt by its flames.

Sir 28:23 Those who desert the Lord will fall into it, it will flare up inextinguishably among them, it will be let
loose against them like a lion, it will tear them like a leopard.

Sir 28:24 Be sure you put a thorn-hedge round your property, lock away your silver and gold;

Sir 28:25 then make scales and weights for your words, and put a door with bolts across your mouth.

Sir 28:26 Take care you take no false step through it, in case you fall a prey to him who lies in wait.

Sir 29:1 Making your neighbour a loan is an act of mercy, to lend him a helping hand is to keep the
commandments.

Sir 29:2 Lend to your neighbour in his time of need, and in your turn repay your neighbour on time.

Sir 29:3 Be as good as your word and keep faith with him, and you will find your needs met every time.

Sir 29:4 Many treat a loan as a windfall, and embarrass those who have come to their rescue.

Sir 29:5 Until he gets something, a man will kiss his neighbour’s hand, and refer diffidently to his wealth; but
when the loan falls due, he puts this off, he repays with offhand words, and pleads the inconvenience of the time.
Sir 29:6 Even if he can be made to pay, his creditor will recover barely half, and consider even that a windfall.
But otherwise he will be cheated of his money, and undeservedly gain himself an enemy; the man will pay him
back in curses and abuse, and with insults instead of honour.

Sir 29:7 Many, not out of malice, refuse to lend; they are merely anxious not to be cheated for nothing.

Sir 29:8 Nevertheless, be patient with those who are badly off, do not keep them waiting on your generosity.

Sir 29:9 In obedience to the commandment, help the poor; do not turn the poor away empty-handed in their
need.

Sir 29:10 Spend your money on your brother or your friend, do not leave it under a stone to rust away.

Sir 29:1 1 Use your wealth as the Most High has decreed; you will find that more profitable than gold.

Sir 29:12 Stock your store-rooms with almsgiving; this will save you from all misfortune.

Sir 29:13 Better than sturdy shield or weighty spear, this will fight for you against the enemy.

Sir 29:14 A good man will go surety for his neighbour; only a shameless wretch would desert him.

Sir 29:15 Do not forget the favour your guarantor has done you; he has given his life for you.

Sir 29:16 A sinner is careless of his guarantor’s prosperity, the ungrateful forgets his deliverer.

Sir 29:17 Going surety has ruined many who were prosperous, tossing them about in a heavy sea.

Sir 29:18 It has driven the powerful from home to wander among foreign nations.

Sir 29:19 A wicked man in a hurry to stand guarantor in the hope of profit, is hurrying to be sentenced.

Sir 29:20 Come to your neighbour’s help as far as you can, but take care not to fall into the same plight.

Sir 29:21 The first thing in life is water, and bread, and clothing, and a house for the sake of privacy.

Sir 29:22 Better the life of the poor under a roof of planks, than lavish fare in somebody else’s house.

Sir 29:23 Whether you have little or much, be content with it, and you will not hear your household complaining.
Sir 29:24 It is a miserable life, going from house to house; wherever you stay, you dare not open your mouth,

Sir 29:25 you do not belong, you receive no thanks for the drink you pour out and hear embittering words into
the bargain:

Sir 29:26 “Come along, stranger, lay the table, what have you got ready? give me something to eat!”.

Sir 29:27 “Go away, stranger, make room for someöne important; my brother is coming to stay, I need the
house”.

Sir 29:28 It is hard for the reasonable to be begrudged hospitality to be shamed like a debtor.

Sir 30:1 Whoëver loves his son will beat him frequently so that in after years the son may be his comfort.

Sir 30:2 Whoëver is strict with his son will reap the benefit, and be able to boast of him to his acquaintances.

Sir 30:3 Whoëver educates his son will be the envy of his enemy, and will be proud of him among his friends.

Sir 30:4 Even when the father dies, he might well not be dead, since he leaves his likeness behind him.

Sir 30:5 In life he has had the joy of his company, dying, he has no anxieties.

Sir 30:6 He leaves an avenger against his enemies and a rewarder of favours for his friends.



Sir 30:7 Whoëver coddles his son will bandage his wounds, his heart will turn over at every cry.

Sir 30:8 A badly broken-in horse turns out stubborn, a son left to himself turns out headstrong.

Sir 30:9 Pamper your child and he will terrorise you, play along with him and he will bring you sorrow.

Sir 30:10 Do not laugh with him, or one day you will weep with him and end up gnashing your teeth.

Sir 30:1 1 While he is young, do not allow him his freedom and do not wink at his mistakes.

Sir 30:12 Bend his neck in youth, bruise his ribs while he is a child, or else he will grow stubborn and
disobedient, and hurt you very deeply.

Sir 30:13 Be strict with your son, and persevere with him, or you will rue his insolence.

Sir 30:14 Better be poor if healthy and fit than rich if tormented in body.

Sir 30:15 Health and strength are better than any gold, a robust body than untold wealth.

Sir 30:16 No riches can outweigh bodily health, no enjoyment surpass a cheerful heart.

Sir 30:17 Better death than a wretched life, and everlasting rest than chronic illness.

Sir 30:18 Good things lavished on a closed mouth are like food offerings put on a grave.

Sir 30:19 What use is an offering to an idol which can neither eat nor smell? How describe someöne pursued by
the Lord’s displeasure?

Sir 30:20 He looks and sighs like a eunuch embracing a pretty girl — how he sighs!

Sir 30:21 Do not abandon yourself to sorrow, do not torment yourself with brooding.

Sir 30:22 Gladness of heart is life to anyone, joy is what gives length of days.

Sir 30:23 Give your cares the slip, console your heart, chase sorrow far away; for sorrow has been the ruin of
many, and is no use to anybody.

Sir 30:24 Jealousy and anger shorten your days, and worry brings premature old age.

Sir 30:25 A genial heart makes a good trencherman, someöne who enjoys a good meal.

Sir 31:1 The sleeplessness brought by wealth makes a person lose weight, the worry it causes drives away
sleep.

Sir 31 :2 The worries of the daytime prevent you from sleeping, like a serious illness, they keep sleep at bay.

Sir 31 :3 The rich for ever toils, piling up money, and then, leaving off, he is gorged with luxuries;

Sir 31 :4 the poor for ever toils, barely making a living, and then, leaving off, is poorer than ever.

Sir 31 :5 No one who loves money can easily avoid sinning, whoëver pursues profit will be corrupted by it.

Sir 31 :6 Gold has been the ruin of many; their coming destruction was self-evident,

Sir 31 :7 since it is a snare for those who sacrifice to it and stupid people all get caught in it.

Sir 31 :8 Happy the rich who is found to be blameless and does not go chasing after gold.

Sir 31 :9 Who is he, so that we can congratulate him, for he has achieved marvels among his fellows?

Sir 31:10 Who has been through this test and emerged perfect? He may well be proud of that! Who has had the
chance to sin and has not sinned, had the chance to do wrong and has not done it?

Sir 31:11 His fortune will be firmly based and the assembly will acclaim his generosity.

Sir 31:12 If you are sitting down to a lavish table, do not display your greed, do not say, “What a lot to eat!”.

Sir 31:13 Remember, it is bad to have a greedy eye. Is any creature more wicked than the eye? - That is why it
is always weeping!

Sir 31:14 Do not reach out for anything your host has his eye on, do not jostle him at the dish.

Sir 31:15 Judge your fellow-guest’s needs by your own, be thoughtful in everyway.

Sir 31:16 Eat what is offered you like a well brought-up person, do not wolf your food or you will earn dislike.

Sir 31:17 For politeness’ sake be the first to stop; do not act the glutton, or you will give offence,

Sir 31:18 and if you are sitting with a large party, do not help yourself before the others do.

Sir 31:19 A little is quite enough for a well-bred person; his breathing is easy when he lies in bed.

Sir 31 :20 A moderate diet ensures sound sleep, one gets up early, in the best of spirits. Sleeplessness,
biliousness and gripe are what the glutton has to endure.

Sir 31 :21 If you are forced to eat too much, get up, go and vomit, and you will feel better.

Sir 31 :22 Listen to me, my child, do not disregard me, eventually you will see the force of my words. Be
moderate in all your activities and illness will never overtake you.

Sir 31 :23 People praise the person who keeps a splendid table, and their opinion of his munificence is sound.

Sir 31 :24 But a niggardly host provokes universal resentment and people will retail instances of his meanness.

Sir 31 :25 Do not play the valiant at your wine, for wine has been the undoing of many.

Sir 31 :26 The furnace proves the temper of steel, and wine proves hearts in the drinking bouts of braggarts.

Sir 31 :27 Wine gives life if drunk in moderation. What is life worth without wine? It came into being to make
people happy.

Sir 31 :28 Drunk at the right time and in the right amount, wine makes for a glad heart and a cheerful mind.

Sir 31 :29 Bitterness of soul comes of wine drunk to excess out of temper or bravado.

Sir 31 :30 Drunkenness excites the stupid to a fury to his own harm, it reduces his strength while leading to
blows.



Sir 31 :31 Do not provoke your fellow-guest at a wine feast, do not make fun of him when he is enjoying himself,
do not take him to task or annoy him by reclaiming money owed.

Sir 32:1 Have they made you the presider? Do not let it go to your head, behave like everyone else in the party,
see that they are happy and then sit down yourself.

Sir 32:2 Having discharged your duties, take your place so that your joy may be through theirs, and you may
receive the crown for your competence.

Sir 32:3 Speak, old man — it is proper that you should - but with discretion: do not spoil the music.

Sir 32:4 If someöne is singing, do not ramble on and do not play the sage at the wrong moment.

Sir 32:5 An amber seal on a precious stone, such is a concert of music at a wine feast.

Sir 32:6 An emerald seal in a golden setting, such are strains of music with a vintage wine.

Sir 32:7 Speak, young man, when you must, but twice at most, and then only if questioned.

Sir 32:8 Keep to the point, say much in few words; give the impression of knowing but not wanting to speak.

Sir 32:9 Among eminent people do not behave as though you were their equal; do not make frivolous remarks
when someöne else is speaking.

Sir 32:10 Lightning comes before the thunder, favour goes ahead of a modest person.

Sir 32:1 1 Leave in good time, do not bring up the rear, and hurry home without loitering.

Sir 32:12 There amuse yourself, and do what you have a mind to, but do not sin by arrogant talk.

Sir 32:13 And for all this bless your Creator, who intoxicates you with his favours.

Sir 32:14 Whoëver fears the Lord will accept his correction; those who look for him will win his favour.

Sir 32:15 Whoëver seeks the Law will be nourished by it, the hypocrite will find it a stumbling-block.

Sir 32:16 Those who fear the Lord win his approval, their good deeds shining like a light.

Sir 32:17 The sinner waves reproof aside, he finds an excuse for headstrong behaviour.

Sir 32:18 A sensible person never scorns a warning; foreigners and the proud do not know about fear.

Sir 32:19 Never act without reflection, and you will not regret your actions.

Sir 32:20 Do not venture on a rough road, for fear of stumbling over the stones.

Sir 32:21 Do not be over-confident on an even road
Sir 32:22 and beware of your own children.

Sir 32:23 Watch yourself in everything you do; this is also the way to keep the commandments.

Sir 32:24 Anyone who trusts in the Law obeys its precepts, no one who has confidence in the Lord will come to
harm.

Sir 33:1 No evil will befall one who fears the Lord, such a one will be rescued even in the ordeal.

Sir 33:2 No one who hates the Law is wise, one who is hypocritical about it is like a storm-tossed ship.

Sir 33:3 An intelligent person will put faith in the Law, for such a one the Law is as dependable as a prophecy.
Sir 33:4 Prepare what you have to say and you will get a hearing, marshal your information before you answer.
Sir 33:5 The feelings of a fool are like a cart-wheel, a fool’s thought revolves like a turning axle.

Sir 33:6 A rutting stallion is like a sarcastic friend; he neighs, whoëver rides him.

Sir 33:7 Why is one day better than another, though the sun gives the same daylight throughout the year?

Sir 33:8 They have been differentiated in the mind of the Lord, who has diversified the seasons and feasts;

Sir 33:9 some he has made more important and has hallowed, others he has made ordinary days.

Sir 33:10 Human beings come from the ground, Adam himself was formed out of earth;

Sir 33:1 1 in the fullness of his wisdom the Lord has made distinctions between them, and diversified their
conditions.

Sir 33:12 Some of them he has blessed, hallowing and setting them near him; others he has cursed and
humiliated by degrading them from their positions.

Sir 33:13 Like clay in the hands of the potter to mould as it pleases him, so are human beings in the hands of
their Maker to reward as he judges right.

Sir 33:14 Opposite evil stands good, opposite death, life; so too opposite the devout stands the sinner.

Sir 33:15 Contemplate all the works of the Most High, you will find they go in pairs, by opposites.

Sir 33:16 Although the last to come, I have kept my eyes open like a man picking up what the grape-pickers
have left.

Sir 33:17 By the blessing of the Lord I have come in first, and like a true grape-picker have filled my winepress.
Sir 33:18 And note, I have not been working merely for myself, but for all who seek instruction.

Sir 33:19 Listen to me, important public figures, presidents of the assembly, give ear!

Sir 33:20 Neither to son nor wife, brother nor friend, give power over yourself during your own lifetime. And do
not give your property to anyone else, in case you regret it and have to ask for it back.

Sir 33:21 As long as you live and there is breath in your body, do not yield power over yourself to anyone;

Sir 33:22 better for your children to come begging to you, than for you to have to go begging to them.

Sir 33:23 In all you do be the master, and leave a reputation unstained.

Sir 33:24 The day your life draws to a close, at the hour of death, then distribute your heritage.



Sir 33:25 Fodder, the stick and burdens for a donkey, bread, discipline and work for a slave.

Sir 33:26 Work your slave hard, and you will have peace of mind, leave his hands idle, and he will be asking for
his freedom.

Sir 33:27 Yoke and harness will bow the neck, for a bad servant, torments and the rack.

Sir 33:28 Set him to work, so that he will not be idle; idleness teaches every kind of mischief.

Sir 33:29 Keep him at his duties, where he should be, if he is disobedient, clap him in irons.

Sir 33:30 But do not be over-exacting with anyone, and do nothing contrary to justice.

Sir 33:31 You have only one slave? Treat him like yourself, since you have acquired him with blood.

Sir 33:32 You have only one slave? Treat him as a brother, since you need him as you need yourself.

Sir 33:33 If you ill-treat him and he runs away, which way will you go to look for him?

Sir 34:1 Vain and deceptive hopes are for the foolish, and dreams lend wings to fools.

Sir 34:2 As well clutch at shadows and chase the wind as put any faith in dreams.

Sir 34:3 Dreams are no different from mirrors; confronting a face, the reflection of that face.

Sir 34:4 What can be cleansed by uncleanness, what can be verified by falsehood?

Sir 34:5 Divinations, auguries and dreams are nonsense, like the fantasies of a pregnant woman.

Sir 34:6 Unless sent as emissaries from the Most High, do not give them a thought;

Sir 34:7 for dreams have led many astray, and those who relied on them have come to grief.

Sir 34:8 Fulfilling the Law requires no such falsehood, and wisdom is perfected in veracity.

Sir 34:9 A much travelled man knows many things, and a man of great experience will talk sound sense.

Sir 34:10 Someöne who has never had his trials knows little; but the travelled man is master of every situation.
Sir 34:1 1 I have seen many things on my travels, I have understood more than I can put into words.

Sir 34:12 I have often been in danger of death, but I have been spared, and this is why:

Sir 34:13 the spirit of those who fear the Lord can survive, for their hope is in someöne with power to save them.
Sir 34:14 No one who fears the Lord need ever hesitate, or ever be daunted, since the Lord is his hope.

Sir 34:15 Happy the soul of one who fears the Lord. On whom does he rely? Who supports him?

Sir 34:16 The eyes of the Lord watch over those who love him, he is their powerful protection and their strong
support, their screen from the desert wind, their shelter from the midday sun, a guard against stumbling, an
assurance against a fall.

Sir 34:17 He revives the spirit and brightens the eyes, he gives health, life and blessing.

Sir 34:18 The sacrifice of an offering unjustly acquired is a mockery; the gifts of the impious are unacceptable.
Sir 34:19 The Most High takes no pleasure in offerings from the godless, multiplying sacrifices will not gain
pardon for sin.

Sir 34:20 Offering sacrifice from the property of the poor is as bad as slaughtering a son before his father’s
eyes.

Sir 34:21 A meagre diet is the very life of the poor, to deprive them of it is to commit murder.

Sir 34:22 To take away a fellow-man’s livelihood is to kill him, to deprive an employee of his wages is to shed

blood.

Sir 34:23 If one person builds while another pulls down, what will they get out of it but trouble?

Sir 34:24 If one person prays and another calls down a curse, to which one’s voice is the Master going to listen?

Sir 34:25 If someöne washes after touching a corpse, and then touches it again, what is the good of his
washing?

Sir 34:26 Just so with someöne who fasts for sin, and then goes and commits it again. Who is going to hear that
person’s prayer? What is the good of the self-abasement?

Sir 35:1 One who keeps the Law multiplies offerings; one who follows the commandments offers communion
sacrifices.

Sir 35:2 Proof of gratitude is an offering of fine flour, almsgiving a sacrifice of praise.

Sir 35:3 To abandon wickedness is what pleases the Lord, to give up wrong-doing is an expiatory sacrifice.

Sir 35:4 Do not appear empty-handed in the Lord’s presence; for all these things are due under the
commandment.

Sir 35:5 The offering of the upright graces the altar, and its savour rises before the Most High.

Sir 35:6 The sacrifice of the upright is acceptable, its memorial will not be forgotten.

Sir 35:7 Honour the Lord with generosity, do not stint the first-fruits you bring.

Sir 35:8 Add a smiling face to all your gifts, and be cheerful as you dedicate your tithes.

Sir 35:9 Give to the Most High as he has given to you, as generously as your means can afford;

Sir 35:10 for the Lord is a good rewarder, he will reward you seven times over.

Sir 35:1 1 Do not try to bribe him with presents, he will not accept them, do not put your faith in wrongly
motivated sacrifices;

Sir 35:12 for the Lord is a judge who is utterly impartial.

Sir 35:13 He never shows partiality to the detriment of the poor, he listens to the plea of the injured party.



Sir 35:14 He does not ignore the orphan’s supplication, nor the widow’s as she pours out her complaint.

Sir 35:15 Do the widow’s tears not run down her cheeks, as she accuses the man who is the cause of them?

Sir 35:16 Whoëver wholeheartedly serves God will be accepted, his petitions will carry to the clouds.

Sir 35:17 The prayer of the humble pierces the clouds: and until it does, he is not to be consoled,

Sir 35:18 nor will he desist until the Most High takes notice of him, acquits the upright and delivers judgement.
Sir 35:19 And the Lord will not be slow, nor will he be dilatory on their behalf,

Sir 35:20 until he has crushed the loins of the merciless and exacted vengeance on the nations,

Sir 35:21 until he has eliminated the hordes of the arrogant and broken the sceptres of the wicked,

Sir 35:22 until he has repaid all people as their deeds deserve and human actions as their intentions merit,

Sir 35:23 until he has judged the case of his people and made them rejoice in his mercy.

Sir 35:24 Mercy is welcome in time of trouble, like rain clouds in time of drought.

Sir 36:1 Take pity on us, Master, Lord of the universe, look at us, spread fear of yourself throughout all other
nations.

Sir 36:2 Raise your hand against the foreign nations and let them see your might.

Sir 36:3 As, in their sight, you have proved yourself holy to us, so now, in our sight, prove yourself great to them.
Sir 36:4 Let them acknowledge you, just as we have acknowledged that there is no God but you, Lord.

Sir 36:5 Send new portents, do fresh wonders, win glory for your hand and your right arm.

Sir 36:6 Rouse your fury, pour out your rage, destroy the opponent, annihilate the enemy.

Sir 36:7 Hasten the day, remember the oath, and let people tell of your mighty deeds.

Sir 36:8 Let fiery wrath swallow up the survivor, and destruction overtake those who oppress your people.

Sir 36:9 Crush the heads of hostile rulers who say, “There is no one else but us!”.

Sir 36:10 Gather together all the tribes of Jacob, restore them their heritage as at the beginning.

Sir 36:1 1 Take pity, Lord, on the people called by your name, on Israel whom you have made your first-born.

Sir 36:12 Have compassion on your holy city, on Jerusalem, the place where you rest.

Sir 36:13 Fill Zion with your praises and your sanctuary with your glory.

Sir 36:14 Vindicate those whom you created first, fulfil what has been prophesied in your name.

Sir 36:15 Give those who wait for you their reward, let your prophets be proved true.

Sir 36:16 Grant, Lord, the prayer of your servants, in the terms of Aaron’s blessing on your people,

Sir 36:17 so that all the earth’s inhabitants may acknowledge that you are the Lord, the everlasting God.

Sir 36:18 The stomach takes in all kinds of food, but some foods are better than others.

Sir 36:19 As the palate discerns the flavour of game, so a shrewd listener detects lying words.

Sir 36:20 A perverse character causes depression in others; it needs experience to know how to repay such a
one.

Sir 36:21 A woman will accept any husband, but some daughters are better than others.

Sir 36:22 A woman’s beauty delights the beholder, a man likes nothing better.

Sir 36:23 If her tongue is kind and gentle, her husband is the happiest of men.

Sir 36:24 The man who takes a wife has the makings of a fortune, a helper to match himself, a pillar of support.
Sir 36:25 When property has no fence, it is open to plunder, when a man has no wife, he is aimless and
querulous.

Sir 36:26 Will anyone trust an armed thief who flits from town to town?

Sir 36:27 So it is with the man who has no nest, and lodges wherever night overtakes him.

Sir 37:1 Any friend will say, “I am your friend too”, but some friends are friends only in name.

Sir 37:2 Is it not a deadly sorrow when a comrade or a friend turns enemy?

Sir 37:3 O evil inclination, why were you created, to cover the earth with deceit?

Sir 37:4 One kind of comrade congratulates a friend in prosperity but in time of trouble appears on the other
side.

Sir 37:5 One kind of comrade genuinely feels for a friend and when it comes to a fight, springs to arms.

Sir 37:6 Do not forget the genuine friend, do not push him out of mind once you are rich.

Sir 37:7 Any adviser will offer advice, but some are governed by self-interest.

Sir 37:8 Beware of someöne who offers advice; first find out what he wants himself- since his advice coincides
with his own interest — in case he has designs on you

Sir 37:9 and tells you, “You are on the right road”, but stands well clear to see what will happen to you.

Sir 37:10 Do not consult anyone who looks at you askance, conceal your plans from people jealous of you.

Sir 37:1 1 Do not consult a woman about her rival, or a coward about war, a merchant about prices, or a buyer
about selling, anyone mean about gratitude, or anyone selfish about kindness, a lazy fellow about any sort of
work, or a casual worker about finishing a job, an idle servant about a major undertaking — do not rely on these
for any advice.

Sir 37:12 But have constant recourse to some devout person, whom you know to be a keeper of the
commandments, whose soul matches your own, and who, if you go wrong, will be sympathetic.



Sir 37:13 Finally, stick to the advice your own heart gives you, no one can be truer to you than that;

Sir 37:14 since a person’s soul often gives a clearer warning than seven watchmen perched on a watchtower.

Sir 37:15 And besides all this beg the Most High to guide your steps into the truth.

Sir 37:16 Reason should be the basis for every activity, reflection must come before any undertaking.

Sir 37:17 Thoughts are rooted in the heart, and this sends out four branches:

Sir 37:18 good and evil, life and death, and mistress of them always is the tongue.

Sir 37:19 One kind of person is clever at teaching others, yet is no good whatever to himself;

Sir 37:20 another, very eloquent, is detested and ends by starving to death,

Sir 37:21 not having won the favour of the Lord, and being destitute of all wisdom.

Sir 37:22 Another considers himself wise and proclaims his intellectual conclusions as certainties.

Sir 37:23 But the truly wise instructs his people and his intellectual conclusions are certainties.

Sir 37:24 The wise is showered with blessings, and all who see him will call him happy.

Sir 37:25 Human life lasts a number of days, but the days of Israel are beyond counting.

Sir 37:26 The wise will earn confidence among the people, his name will live for ever.

Sir 37:27 During your life, my child, see what suits your constitution, do not give it what you find disagrees with
it;

Sir 37:28 for not everything is good for everybody, nor does everybody like everything.

Sir 37:29 Do not be insatiable for any delicacy, do not be greedy for food,

Sir 37:30 for over-eating leads to illness and excess leads to liver-attacks.

Sir 37:31 Many people have died from over-eating; control yourself, and so prolong your life.

Sir 38:1 Treat the doctor with the honour that is his due, in consideration of his services; for he too has been

created by the Lord.

Sir 38:2 Healing itself comes from the Most High, like a gift received from a king.

Sir 38:3 The doctor’s learning keeps his head high, and the great regard him with awe.

Sir 38:4 The Lord has brought forth medicinal herbs from the ground, and no one sensible will despise them.

Sir 38:5 Did not a piece of wood once sweeten the water, thus giving proof of its power?

Sir 38:6 He has also given some people knowledge, so that they may draw credit from his mighty works.

Sir 38:7 He uses these for healing and relieving pain; the druggist makes up a mixture from them.

Sir 38:8 Thus, there is no end to his activities; thanks to him, well-being exists throughout the world.

Sir 38:9 My child, when you are ill, do not rebel, but pray to the Lord and he will heal you.

Sir 38:10 Renounce your faults, keep your hands unsoiled, and cleanse your heart from all sin.

Sir 38:1 1 Offer incense and a memorial of fine flour, make as rich an offering as you can afford.

Sir 38:12 Then let the doctor take over — the Lord created him too — do not let him leave you, for you need him.

Sir 38:13 There are times when good health depends on doctors.

Sir 38:14 For they, in their turn, will pray the Lord to grant them the grace to relieve and to heal, and so prolong
your life.

Sir 38:15 Whoëver sins in the eyes of his Maker, let such a one come under the care of the doctor!

Sir 38:16 My child, shed tears over the dead, lament for the dead to show your sorrow, then bury the body with
due ceremony and do not fail to honour the grave.

Sir 38:17 Weep bitterly, beat your breast, observe the mourning the dead deserves for a day or two, to avoid
censorious comment, and then be comforted in your sorrow;

Sir 38:18 for grief can lead to death, a grief-stricken heart loses all energy.

Sir 38:19 In affliction sorrow persists, a life of grief is hard to bear.

Sir 38:20 Do not abandon your heart to grief, drive it away, bear your own end in mind.

Sir 38:21 Do not forget, there is no coming back; you cannot help the dead, and you will harm yourself.

Sir 38:22 “Remember my doom, since it will be yours too; I yesterday, you today!”.

Sir 38:23 Once the dead are laid to rest, let their memory rest, do not fret for them, once their spirit departs.

Sir 38:24 Leisure gives the scribe the chance to acquire wisdom; a man with few commitments can grow wise.
Sir 38:25 How can the ploughman become wise, whose sole ambition is to wield the goad, driving his oxen,
engrossed in their work, his conversation limited to bullocks,

Sir 38:26 his thoughts absorbed in the furrows he traces and his long evenings spent in fattening heifers?

Sir 38:27 Similarly with all workmen and craftsmen, toiling day and night; those who engrave seals, for ever
trying to think of a new design, concentrating on catching a good likeness and staying up late to get the work
done.

Sir 38:28 Similarly with the blacksmith sitting by his anvil; he considers what to do with the pig-iron, the breath of
the fire scorches his skin, as he contends with the heat of the furnace; the noise of the hammer deafens him, his
eyes are fixed on the pattern; he concentrates on getting the job done well and stays up late to apply the
finishing touches.

Sir 38:29 Similarly with the potter, sitting at his work, turning the wheel with his feet; constantly on the alert over



his work, each flick of the finger premeditated;

Sir 38:30 he pummels the clay with his arm, and with his feet he kneads it; he concentrates on applying the
glaze right and stays up late to clean the kiln.

Sir 38:31 All these people rely on their hands and each is skilled at his own craft.

Sir 38:32 A town could not be inhabited without them, there would be no settling, no travelling.

Sir 38:33 But you will not find them in the parliament, they do not hold high rank in the assembly. They do not sit
on the judicial bench, and they do not meditate on the Law.

Sir 38:34 They are not remarkable for their culture or judgement, nor are they found frequenting the
philosophers. They sustain the structure of the world, and their prayer is concerned with their trade.

Sir 39:1 Not so with one who concentrates his mind and his meditation on the Law of the Most High. He
researches into the wisdom of all the Ancients, he occupies his time with the prophecies.

Sir 39:2 He preserves the discourses of famous men, he is at home with the niceties of parables.

Sir 39:3 He researches into the hidden sense of proverbs, he ponders the obscurities of parables.

Sir 39:4 He enters the service of princes, he is seen in the presence of rulers. He travels in foreign countries, he
has experienced human good and human evil.

Sir 39:5 At dawn and with all his heart he turns to the Lord his Creator; he pleads in the presence of the Most
High, he opens his mouth in prayer and makes entreaty for his sins.

Sir 39:6 If such be the will of the great Lord, he will be filled with the spirit of intelligence, he will shower forth
words of wisdom, and in prayer give thanks to the Lord.

Sir 39:7 He will grow upright in purpose and learning, he will ponder the Lord’s hidden mysteries.

Sir 39:8 He will display the instruction he has received, taking his pride in the Law of the Lord’s covenant.

Sir 39:9 Many will praise his intelligence and it will never be forgotten. His memory will not disappear,
generation after generation his name will live.

Sir 39:10 Nations will proclaim his wisdom, the assembly will celebrate his praises.

Sir 39:1 1 If he lives long, his name will be more glorious than a thousand others, and if he dies, that will satisfy
him just as well.

Sir 39:12 And here are some more of my reflections: yes, I am as full as the moon at the full!

Sir 39:13 Listen to me, devout children, and blossom like the rose that grows on the bank of a watercourse.

Sir 39:14 Give off a sweet smell like incense, flower like the lily, spread your fragrance abroad, sing a song of
praise blessing the Lord for all his works.

Sir 39:15 Declare the greatness of his name, proclaim his praise with song and with lyre, and this is how you
must sing his praises:

Sir 39:16 “How wonderful, the actions of the Lord! Whatever he orders is done at the proper time!”. You must not
say, “What is this? Why is that?”. There is a proper time for every question.

Sir 39:17 At his word, the water stops and piles up high, at his voice, the watery reservoirs take shape,

Sir 39:18 at his command, whatever he wants is done, no one can stop him, if he intends to save.

Sir 39:19 He can see whatever human beings are doing, nothing can be hidden from his eye;

Sir 39:20 his gaze stretches from eternity to eternity, and nothing can astonish him.

Sir 39:21 You must not say, “What is this? Why is that?”. for everything has been made for a purpose.

Sir 39:22 As his blessing covers the dry land like a river and soaks it like a flood,

Sir 39:23 so retribution is his legacy to the nations, just as he has turned fresh waters to salt.

Sir 39:24 His ways are as smooth for the devout, as they are full of obstacles for the wicked.

Sir 39:25 Good things were created from the beginning for good people, as bad ones were for sinners.

Sir 39:26 The prime needs of human beings for living are water and fire, iron and salt, wheat-flour, milk and
honey, the juice of the grape, oil and clothing.

Sir 39:27 All these are good for those who are good, but turn out bad for sinners.

Sir 39:28 Some winds have been created for punishing, in his fury, he uses them as scourges; on the day of
doom, they unleash their violence and appease the wrath of their Creator.

Sir 39:29 Fire and hail, famine and death, have all been created for punishing.

Sir 39:30 Wild animals’ fangs, scorpions, vipers, the avenging sword for the ruin of the godless:

Sir 39:31 all of them exult in discharging his orders, ready on earth whenever the need arises and, when their
time comes, not falling short of his word.

Sir 39:32 That is why I was determined from the outset, why I have pondered and why I have written,

Sir 39:33 “The works of the Lord are all good, when the time is right, he gives whatever is needed.

Sir 39:34 You must not say, ‘This is worse than that’, for, sooner or later, everything proves its worth.

Sir 39:35 So now, sing with all your heart and voice, and bless the name of the Lord!”.

Sir 40:1 A hard lot has been created for human beings, a heavy yoke lies on the children of Adam from the day
they come out of their mother’s womb, until the day they return to the mother of them all.

Sir 40:2 What fills them with foreboding and their hearts with fear is dread of the day of death.



Sir 40:3 From the one who sits on a glorious throne to the wretch in dust and ashes,

Sir 40:4 from the one who wears purple and a crown to the one dressed in sacking, all is fury and jealousy,
turmoil and unrest, fear of death, rivalry, strife.

Sir 40:5 And even at night while he rests on his bed his sleep only gives a new twist to his worries:

Sir 40:6 scarcely has he lain down to rest, when in his sleep, as if in broad daylight, he is troubled with
nightmares, like one who has escaped from a battle,

Sir 40:7 and at the moment of rescue he wakes up, amazed that there was nothing to be afraid of!

Sir 40:8 For all creatures, human and animal — and seven times more for sinners-
Sir40:9 there is death and blood and strife and the sword, disasters, famine, affliction, plague.

Sir 40:10 These things were all created for the wicked, and the Flood came because of them.

Sir 40:1 1 All that comes from the earth returns to the earth, and what comes from the water returns to the sea.
Sir 40:12 All bribery and injustice will be blotted out, but good faith will stand for ever.

Sir 40:13 Ill-gotten wealth will vanish like a torrent, like the single thunder-clap that heralds rain.

Sir 40:14 When he opens his hand, he rejoices, by the same token, sinners come to ruin.

Sir 40:15 The sprigs of the godless will not make many branches, tainted roots find only hard rock.

Sir 40:16 The reed that grows by every lake and river’s edge is the first plant to be uprooted.

Sir 40:17 Charity is a very paradise of blessing and almsgiving endures for ever.

Sir 40:18 For a person of private means and one who works hard, life is pleasant, better off than either, one who
finds a treasure.

Sir 40:19 Children and the founding of a city perpetuate a name: more esteemed than either, a perfect wife.

Sir 40:20 Wine and music cheer the heart; better than either, the love of wisdom.

Sir 40:21 Flute and harp add sweetness to a song; better than either, a melodious voice.

Sir 40:22 The eye longs for grace and beauty; better than either, the green of spring corn.

Sir 40:23 Friend or comrade — it is always well met; better than either, a wife and husband.

Sir 40:24 Brothers and allies are good in times of trouble; better than either, almsgiving to the rescue.

Sir 40:25 Gold and silver will steady your feet; more esteemed than either, good advice.

Sir 40:26 Money and strength make a confident heart; better than either, the fear of the Lord. With fear of the
Lord, nothing is lacking: no need to seek for other help.

Sir 40:27 Fear of the Lord is a paradise of blessing, a better protection than the highest reputation.

Sir 40:28 My child, do not live by sponging off others, better be dead than be a sponger.

Sir 40:29 A life spent in eyeing someöne else’s table cannot be accounted a life at all. Other people’s food
defiles the gullet; a wise, well-brought-up person will beware of doing this.

Sir 40:30 What a sponger says may sound very sweet but in his belly there burns a fire.

Sir 41:1 O death, how bitter it is to remember you for someöne peacefully living with his possessions, for
someöne with no worries and everything going well and who can still enjoy his food!

Sir 41 :2 O death, your sentence is welcome to one in want, whose strength is failing, to one worn out with age
and a thousand worries, resentful and impatient!

Sir 41 :3 Do not dread death’s sentence; remember those who came before you and those who will come after.
Sir 41 :4 This is the sentence passed on all living creatures by the Lord, so why object to what seems good to
the Most High? Whether your life lasts ten or a hundred or a thousand years, its length will not be held against
you in Sheol.

Sir 41 :5 Hateful brats, such are the children of sinners, who foregather in the haunts of the godless.

Sir 41 :6 The inheritance of sinners’ children is doomed to perish, their posterity will endure lasting reproach.

Sir 41 :7 A godless father will be blamed by his children for the reproach he has brought on them.

Sir 41 :8 A bad outlook for you, godless people, who have forsaken the Law of God Most High.

Sir 41 :9 When you were born, you were born to be accursed, and when you die, that curse will be your portion.
Sir 41:10 All that comes from the earth returns to the earth, so too the wicked proceed from curse to destruction.
Sir 41:11 Mourning concerns only the bodies of the dead, but the worthless name of sinners will be blotted out.
Sir 41:12 Be careful of your reputation, for it will last you longer than a thousand great hoards of gold.

Sir 41:13 A good life lasts a certain number of days, but a good reputation lasts for ever.

Sir 41:14 Keep my instructions and be at peace, my children. Wisdom hidden away and treasure undisplayed,
what use is either of these?

Sir 41:1 5 Better someöne who hides his folly than one who hides his wisdom.

Sir 41:16 Preserve a sense of shame in the following matters, for not every kind of shame is right to harbour,
nor is every situation correctly appraised by all.

Sir 41:1 7 Be ashamed, before father and mother, of depraved behaviour, and before prince or potentate of
telling lies;

Sir 41:1 8 of wrong-doing before judge or magistrate, and of impiety before the assembly of the people;

Sir 41:1 9 of sharp practice before your companion and your friend, and of theft before the neighbourhood you



live in.

Sir 41 :20 Before the truth and covenant of God, be ashamed of leaning elbows on the table,

Sir 41 :21 of being ungracious when giving or receiving, of ignoring those who greet you,

Sir 41 :22 of gazing at a loose woman, of repulsing your fellow-countryman,

Sir 41 :23 of misappropriating another’s portion or gift, of paying court to another man’s wife,

Sir 41 :24 of making advances to his servant-girl — do not go near her bed-

Sir 41 :25 of saying disagreeable things to friends — do not follow up a gift with a taunt-

Sir 41 :26 of repeating everything you hear and of betraying confidences.

Sir 41 :27 Then you will know what true shame is, and you will find yourself in everyone’s graces.

Sir 42:1 The following things you should not be ashamed of, and do not sin from fear of what others think:

Sir 42:2 of the Law of the Most High or of the covenant, of a verdict that acquits the godless,

Sir 42:3 of keeping accounts with a travelling companion, of settling property on your friends,

Sir 42:4 of being accurate over scales and weights, of making small and large profits,

Sir 42:5 of gaining from commercial transactions, of disciplining your children strictly, of lashing a wicked slave
until you draw blood.

Sir 42:6 With an interfering wife, it is as well to use your seal, and where there are many hands, lock things up.
Sir 42:7 Whatever stores you issue, do it by number and weight, spendings and takings, put everything in
writing.

Sir 42:8 Do not be ashamed to correct a stupid person or a fool, or an old dotard who bickers with young
people. Then you will show yourself really educated and win the approval of everyone.

Sir 42:9 Unknown to her, a daughter keeps her father awake, the worry she gives him drives away his sleep: in
her youth, in case she never marries, married, in case she should be disliked,

Sir 42:10 as a virgin, in case she should be defiled and found with child in her father’s house, having a husband,
in case she goes astray, married, in case she should be sterile!

Sir 42:1 1 Your daughter is headstrong? Keep a sharp look-out that she does not make you the laughing-stock of
your enemies, the talk of the town, the object of common gossip, and put you to public shame.

Sir 42:12 Do not stare at any man for his good looks, do not sit down with women;

Sir 42:13 for moth comes out of clothes, and woman’s spite out of woman.

Sir 42:14 Better a man’s spite than a woman’s kindness: women give rise to shame and reproach.

Sir 42:15 Next, I shall remind you of the works of the Lord, and tell of what I have seen. By the words of the Lord
his works come into being and all creation obeys his will.

Sir 42:16 The shining sun looks down on all things, and the work of the Lord is full of his glory.

Sir 42:17 The Lord has not granted the Holy Ones the power to tell of all his marvels which the Almighty Lord
has solidly constructed for the universe to stand firm in his glory.

Sir 42:18 He has fathomed both the abyss and the human heart and seen into their devious ways; for the Most
High knows all there is to know and sees the signs of the times.

Sir 42:19 He declares what is past and what will be, and reveals the trend of hidden things.

Sir 42:20 Not a thought escapes him, not a single word is hidden from him.

Sir 42:21 He has embellished the magnificent works of his wisdom, he is from everlasting to everlasting, nothing
can be added to him, nothing taken away, he needs no one’s advice.

Sir 42:22 How lovely, all his works, how dazzling to the eye!

Sir 42:23 They all live and last for ever, and, whatever the circumstances, all obey.

Sir 42:24 All things go in pairs, by opposites, he has not made anything imperfect:

Sir 42:25 one thing complements the excellence of another. Who could ever grow tired of gazing at his glory?

Sir 43:1 Pride of the heights, a clear vault of the sky — such is the beauty of the heavens, a glorious sight.

Sir 43:2 The sun, as he emerges, proclaims at his rising, “How wonderful a thing, the work of the Most High!”.

Sir 43:3 At his zenith, he parches the ground, who can withstand his blaze?

Sir 43:4 We have to blow the furnace to produce any heat, the sun burns the mountains three times as much;
breathing out blasts of fire, flashing his rays, he dazzles the eyes.

Sir 43:5 Great is the Lord who created him and whose word speeds him on his course.

Sir 43:6 And then the moon, ever punctual to mark the times, an everlasting sign:

Sir 43:7 It is the moon that signals the feasts, a luminary that wanes after being full.

Sir 43:8 The month derives its name from hers, she waxes wonderfully in her phases, banner of the hosts on
high, shining in the vault of heaven.

Sir 43:9 The glory of the stars makes the beauty of the sky, a brilliant adornment of the Lord on High.

Sir 43:10 At the words of the Holy One they stand as he decrees, and never grow slack at their watch.

Sir 43:1 1 See the rainbow and praise its Maker, so superbly beautiful in its splendour.

Sir 43:12 Across the sky it forms a glorious arc drawn by the hands of the Most High.

Sir 43:13 By his command he sends the snow, he speeds the lightning by his command.



Sir 43:14 In the same way, his treasuries open and the clouds fly out like birds.

Sir 43:15 His great power solidifies the clouds, then pulverises them into hail.

Sir 43:16 at the sight of him, the mountains quake. At his will the south wind blows, or the storm from the north
and the whirlwind.

Sir 43:17 At the roar of his thunder, the earth writhes in labour,

Sir 43:18 He sprinkles snow like birds alighting, it comes down like locusts settling. The eye marvels at the
beauty of its whiteness, and the mind is amazed at its falling.

Sir 43:19 Over the earth, like salt, he also pours hoarfrost, which, when it freezes, bristles like thorns.

Sir 43:20 The cold wind blows from the north, and ice forms on the water; it forms on every piece of standing
water, covering it like a breastplate.

Sir 43:21 The wind swallows up the mountains and scorches the desert, like a fire it consumes the vegetation.
Sir 43:22 But cloud brings swift healing, and dew brings joy after the heat.

Sir 43:23 By his own resourcefulness he has tamed the abyss, and planted it with islands.

Sir 43:24 Those who sail the sea tell of its dangers, their accounts fill our ears with amazement:

Sir 43:25 for there too exist strange and wonderful works, animals of every kind and huge sea creatures.

Sir 43:26 Thanks to God, his messenger reaches port, everything works out according to his word.

Sir 43:27 We could say much more and still fall short; to put it concisely, “He is all”.

Sir 43:28 Where shall we find sufficient power to glorify him, since he is the Great One, above all his works,

Sir 43:29 the awe-inspiring Lord, stupendously great, and wonderful in his power?

Sir 43:30 Exalt the Lord in your praises as high as you may — still he surpasses you. Exert all your strength
when you exalt him, do not grow tired — you will never come to the end.

Sir 43:31 Who has ever seen him to describe him? Who can glorify him as he deserves?

Sir 43:32 Many mysteries remain even greater than these, for we have seen only a few of his works,

Sir 43:33 the Lord himself having created all things and given wisdom to those who are devout.

Sir 44:1 Next let us praise illustrious men, our ancestors in their successive generations.

Sir 44:2 The Lord has created an abundance of glory, and displayed his greatness from earliest times.

Sir 44:3 Some wielded authority as kings and were renowned for their strength; others were intelligent advisers
and uttered prophetic sayings.

Sir 44:4 Others directed the people by their advice, by their understanding of the popular mind, and by the wise
words of their teaching;

Sir 44:5 others composed musical melodies and set down ballads;

Sir 44:6 others were rich and powerful, living peacefully in their homes.

Sir 44:7 All these were honoured by their contemporaries and were the glory of their day.

Sir 44:8 Some of them left a name behind them, so that their praises are still sung.

Sir 44:9 While others have left no memory, and disappeared as though they had not existed. They are now as
though they had never been, and so too, their children after them.

Sir 44:10 But here is a list of illustrious men whose good works have not been forgotten.

Sir 44:1 1 In their descendants they find a rich inheritance, their posterity.

Sir 44:12 Their descendants stand by the commandments and, thanks to them, so do their children’s children.
Sir 44:13 Their offspring will last for ever, their glory will not fade.

Sir 44:14 Their bodies have been buried in peace, and their name lives on for all generations.

Sir 44:15 The peoples will proclaim their wisdom, the assembly will celebrate their praises.

Sir 44:16 Enoch pleased the Lord and was transferred to heaven, an example for the conversion of all
generations.

Sir 44:17 Noah was found perfectly upright, in the time of retribution he became the heir: because of him a
remnant was preserved for the earth at the coming of the Flood.

Sir 44:18 Everlasting covenants were made with him that never again should every living creature perish by
flood.

Sir 44:19 Abraham, the great ancestor of a host of nations, no one was ever his equal in glory.

Sir 44:20 He observed the Law of the Most High, and entered into a covenant with him. He confirmed the
covenant in his own flesh, and proved himself faithful under ordeal.

Sir 44:21 The Lord therefore promised him on oath to bless the nations through his descendants, to multiply him
like the dust on the ground, to exalt his descendants like the stars, and to give them the land as their heritage,
from one sea to the other, from the River to the ends of the earth.

Sir 44:22 To Isaac too, for the sake of Abraham his father, he assured

Sir 44:23 the blessing of all humanity; he caused the covenant to rest on the head of Jacob. He confirmed him
in his blessings and gave him the land as his inheritance; he divided it into portions, and shared it out among the
twelve tribes.

Sir 45:1 From Jacob’s stock he produced a generous man who found favour in the eyes of all humanity, beloved



by God and people, Moses, of blessed memory.

Sir 45:2 He made him the equal of the holy ones in glory and made him strong, to the terror of his enemies.

Sir 45:3 By the word of Moses, he made prodigies cease and raised him high in the respect of kings; he gave
him commandments for his people, and showed him something of his glory.

Sir 45:4 For his loyalty and gentleness he sanctified him, choosing him alone out of all human beings;

Sir 45:5 he allowed him to hear his voice, and led him into the darkness;

Sir 45:6 he gave him the commandments face to face, the law of life and knowledge, to teach Jacob his
ordinances and Israel his decrees. He raised up Aaron, a holy man like Moses, his brother, of the tribe of Levi.
Sir 45:7 He made an everlasting covenant with him, and gave him the priesthood of the people. He adorned him
with impressive vestments, he dressed him in a robe of glory.

Sir 45:8 He clothed him in glorious perfection and invested him with rich ornaments, the breeches, the long
robe, the <i>ephod</i>.

Sir 45:9 To surround the robe he gave him pomegranates, and many gold bells all round to chime at every step,
for their sound to be heard in the Temple as a reminder to the children of his people;

Sir 45:10 and a sacred vestment of gold and aquamarine and scarlet, the work of an embroiderer; the pectoral
of judgement, the urim and thummim, of plaited crimson, the work of a craftsman;

Sir 45:1 1 precious stones cut like seals mounted in gold, the work of a jeweller, as a reminder with their
engraved inscriptions of the number of the tribes of Israel;

Sir 45:12 and a golden diadem on his turban, engraved with the seal of consecration; superb ornamentation,
magnificent work, adornment to delight the eye.

Sir 45:13 There had never been such lovely things before him, and no one else has ever put them on, but only
his own sons, and his descendants for all time.

Sir 45:14 His sacrifices were to be burnt entirely, twice each day and for ever.

Sir 45:15 Moses consecrated him and anointed him with holy oil; and this was an everlasting covenant for him,
and for his descendants as long as the heavens endure, that he should preside over worship, act as priest, and
bless the people in the name of the Lord.

Sir 45:16 He chose him out of all the living to offer sacrifices to the Lord, incense and perfume as a memorial to
make expiation for the people.

Sir 45:17 He entrusted him with his commandments, committed to him the statutes of the Law for him to teach
Jacob his decrees and enlighten Israel on his Law.

Sir 45:18 Others plotted against him, they were jealous of him in the desert, Dathan and Abiram and their men,
Korah and his crew in fury and rage.

Sir 45:19 The Lord saw it and was displeased, his raging fury made an end of them; he worked miracles on
them, consuming them by his flaming fire.

Sir 45:20 And he added to Aaron’s glory, he gave him an inheritance; he allotted him the offerings of the first-
fruits, before all else, as much bread as he could want.

Sir 45:21 Thus they eat the sacrifices of the Lord which he gave to him and his posterity.

Sir 45:22 But of the people’s territory he inherits nothing, he alone of all the people has no share, “For I myself
am your share and heritage”.

Sir 45:23 Phinehas son of Eleazar is third in glory because of his zeal in the fear of the Lord, because he stood
firm when the people revolted, with a staunch and courageous heart; and in this way made expiation for Israel.
Sir 45:24 Hence a covenant of peace was sealed with him, making him governor of both sanctuary and people,
and securing to him and his descendants the high priestly dignity for ever.

Sir 45:25 There was also a covenant with David son of Jesse, of the tribe of Judah, a royal succession by
exclusively linear descent, but the succession of Aaron passes to all his descendants.

Sir 45:26 May God endow your hearts with wisdom to judge his people uprightly, so that the virtues of your
ancestors may never fade, and their glory may pass to all their descendants!

Sir 46:1 Mighty in war was Joshua son of Nun, successor to Moses in the prophetic office, who well deserved
his name, and was a great saviour of the chosen people, wreaking vengeance on the enemies who opposed
him, and so bringing Israel into its inheritance.

Sir 46:2 How splendid he was when, arms uplifted, he brandished his sword against cities!

Sir 46:3 Who had ever shown such determination as his? He himself led the battles of the Lord.

Sir 46:4 Was not the sun held back by his hand, and one day drawn out into two?

Sir 46:5 He called on the Most High, the Mighty One, while pressing the enemies from all directions, and the
great Lord answered him with hard and violent hailstones.

Sir 46:6 He fell on that enemy nation, and at the Descent destroyed all resistance to make the nations
acknowledge his warlike prowess and that he was waging war on behalf of the Lord.

Sir 46:7 For he was a follower of the Mighty One, in the time of Moses showing his devotion, he and Caleb son
of Jephunneh, by opposing the whole community, by preventing the people from sinning, and by silencing the



mutters of rebellion.

Sir 46:8 Hence these two alone were preserved out of six hundred thousand men on the march, and brought
into their inheritance, into a land where milk and honey flow.

Sir 46:9 And the Lord conferred strength on Caleb too, which stayed by him into old age, so that he could invest
the highlands of the country which his descendants kept as their inheritance,

Sir 46:10 so that every Israelite might see that it is good to follow the Lord.

Sir 46:1 1 The Judges too, each when he was called, all men whose hearts were never disloyal, who never
turned their backs on the Lord — may their memory be blessed!

Sir 46:12 May their bones flourish again from the tomb, and may the names of those illustrious men be worthily
borne by their sons!

Sir 46:13 Samuel was the beloved of his Lord; prophet of the Lord, he instituted the kingdom, and anointed
rulers over his people.

Sir 46:14 By the Law of the Lord he judged the assembly, and the Lord watched over Jacob.

Sir 46:15 By his loyalty he was recognised as a prophet, by his words he was known to be a trustworthy seer.

Sir 46:16 He called on the Lord, the Mighty One, when his enemies pressed in from all directions, by offering a
sucking lamb.

Sir 46:17 And the Lord thundered from heaven, and made his voice heard in a rolling peal;

Sir 46:18 he massacred the leaders of the enemy, and all the rulers of the Philistines.

Sir 46:19 Before the time of his everlasting rest he bore witness to the Lord and his anointed, “Of no property,
not even a pair of sandals, have I ever deprived a soul”. Nor did anyone accuse him.

Sir 46:20 And, having fallen asleep, he prophesied again, warning the king of his end; he spoke from the depths
of the earth in prophecy, to blot out the wickedness of the people.

Sir 47:1 After him arose Nathan, to prophesy in the time of David.

Sir 47:2 As the fat is set apart from the communion sacrifice, so was David chosen out of the Israelites.

Sir 47:3 He played with lions as though with kids, and with bears as though with lambs.

Sir 47:4 While still a boy, did he not slay the giant and take away the people’s shame, by hurling a stone from
his sling and cutting short the boasting of Goliath?

Sir 47:5 For he called on the Lord Most High, who gave strength to his right arm to put a mighty warrior to death
and assert the strength of his own people.

Sir 47:6 Hence they gave him credit for ten thousand, and praised him while they blessed the Lord, by offering
him a crown of glory.

Sir 47:7 For he destroyed the enemies on every front, he annihilated his foes, the Philistines, and crushed their
strength for ever.

Sir 47:8 In all his activities he gave thanks to the Holy One Most High in words of glory; he put all his heart into
his songs out of love for his Creator.

Sir 47:9 He placed singers before the altar, melodiously to sing;

Sir 47:10 he gave the feasts their splendour, the festivals their solemn pomp, causing the Lord’s holy name to
be praised and the sanctuary to resound from dawn.

Sir 47:1 1 The Lord took away his sins, making his strength ever greater; he gave him a royal covenant, and a
glorious throne in Israel.

Sir 47:12 A wise son succeeded him, who lived content, thanks to him.

Sir 47:13 Solomon reigned in a time of peace, and God gave him peace all round so that he could raise a house
to his name and prepare an everlasting sanctuary.

Sir 47:14 How wise you were despite your youth, like a river, brimming over with intelligence!

Sir 47:15 Your mind ranged the earth, you filled it with mysterious sayings.

Sir 47:16 Your name reached the distant islands, and you were loved for your peace.

Sir 47:17 Your songs, your proverbs, your sayings and your answers were the wonder of the world.

Sir 47:18 In the name of the Lord God, of him who is called the God of Israel, you amassed gold like so much
tin, and made silver as common as lead.

Sir 47:19 You abandoned your body to women, you became the slave of your appetites.

Sir 47:20 You stained your honour, you profaned your stock, so bringing retribution on your children and
affliction for your folly:

Sir 47:21 the empire split in two, from Ephraim arose a rebel kingdom.

Sir 47:22 But the Lord never goes back on his mercy, never cancels any of his words, will neither deny offspring
to his elect nor stamp out the line of the man who loved him. And hence, he has granted a remnant to Jacob and
to David a root sprung from him.

Sir 47:23 Solomon rested with his ancestors, leaving one of his stock as his successor, the stupidest member of
the nation, brainless Rehoboam, who drove the people to rebel.

Sir 47:24 Next, Jeroboam son of Nebat, who made Israel sin, and set Ephraim on the way of evil; from then on



their sins multiplied so excessively as to drive them out of their country;

Sir 47:25 for they tried out every kind of wickedness, until vengeance overtook them.

Sir 48:1 Then the prophet Elijah arose like a fire, his word flaring like a torch.

Sir 48:2 It was he who brought famine on them and decimated them in his zeal.

Sir 48:3 By the word of the Lord he shut up the heavens, three times also he brought down fire.

Sir 48:4 How glorious you were in your miracles, Elijah! Has anyone reason to boast as you have? -
Sir 48:5 rousing a corpse from death, from Sheol, by the word of the Most High;

Sir 48:6 dragging kings down to destruction, and high dignitaries from their beds;

Sir 48:7 hearing a rebuke on Sinai and decrees of punishment on Horeb;

Sir 48:8 anointing kings as avengers, and prophets to succeed you;

Sir 48:9 taken up in the whirlwind of fire, in a chariot with fiery horses;

Sir 48:10 designated in the prophecies of doom to allay God’s wrath before the fury breaks, to turn the hearts of
fathers towards their children, and to restore the tribes of Jacob.

Sir 48:1 1 Blessed, those who will see you, and those who have fallen asleep in love; for we too shall certainly
have life.

Sir 48:12 Such was Elijah, who was enveloped in a whirlwind; and Elisha was filled with his spirit; throughout his
life no ruler could shake him, and no one could subdue him.

Sir 48:13 No task was too hard for him, and even in death his body prophesied.

Sir 48:14 In his lifetime he performed wonders, and in death his works were marvellous.

Sir 48:15 Despite all this the people did not repent, nor did they give up their sins, until they were herded out of
their country and scattered all over the earth;

Sir 48:16 only a few of the people were left, with a ruler of the House of David. Some of them did what pleased
the Lord, others piled sin on sin.

Sir 48:17 Hezekiah fortified his city, and laid on a water-supply inside it; with iron he tunnelled through the rock
and constructed storage-tanks.

Sir 48:18 In his days Sennacherib invaded and sent Rabshakeh; he lifted his hand against Zion, and boasted
loudly in his arrogance.

Sir 48:19 Then their hearts and hands trembled, they felt the pangs of a woman in labour,

Sir 48:20 but they called on the merciful Lord, stretching out their hands towards him. Swiftly the Holy One
heard them from heaven and delivered them by the agency of Isaiah;

Sir 48:21 he struck the camp of the Assyrians and his Angel annihilated them.

Sir 48:22 For Hezekiah did what is pleasing to the Lord, and was steadfast in the ways of David his father,

enjoined on him by the prophet Isaiah, a great man trustworthy in his vision.

Sir 48:23 In his days the sun moved back; he prolonged the life of the king.

Sir 48:24 In the power of the spirit he saw the last things, he comforted the mourners of Zion,

Sir 48:25 he revealed the future to the end of time, and hidden things long before they happened.

Sir 49:1 The memory of Josiah is like blended incense prepared by the perfumer’s art; it is as sweet as honey to
all mouths, and like music at a wine feast.

Sir 49:2 He took the right course, of converting the people, he rooted out the iniquitous abominations,

Sir 49:3 he set his heart on the Lord, in godless times he upheld the cause of religion.

Sir 49:4 Apart from David, Hezekiah and Josiah, they all heaped wrong on wrong, they abandoned the Law of

the Most High: the kings of Judah disappeared;

Sir 49:5 for they handed their power over to others and their honour to a foreign nation.

Sir 49:6 The holy, chosen city was burnt down, her streets were left deserted,

Sir 49:7 as Jeremiah had predicted; for they had ill-treated him, though consecrated a prophet in his mother’s
womb, to tear up and afflict and destroy, but also to build up and to plant.

Sir 49:8 Ezekiel saw a vision of glory which God showed to him above the chariot of the great winged creatures,

Sir 49:9 for he mentioned the enemies in the downpour to the advantage of those who follow the right way.

Sir 49:10 As for the twelve prophets, may their bones flower again from the tomb, since they have comforted
Jacob and redeemed him in faith and hope.

Sir 49:1 1 How shall we extol Zerubbabel? He was like a signet ring on the right hand,

Sir 49:12 so too was Joshua son of Jozadak; they who in their days built the Temple and raised a sanctuary
sacred to the Lord, destined to everlasting glory.

Sir 49:13 Great too is the memory of Nehemiah, who rebuilt our walls which lay in ruins, erected the bolted
gates and rebuilt our houses.

Sir 49:14 No one else has ever been created on earth to equal Enoch, for he was taken up from earth.

Sir 49:15 And no one else ever born has been like Joseph, the leader of his brothers, the prop of his people; his
bones received a visitation.

Sir 49:16 Shem and Seth were the most honoured of men, but above every living creature is Adam.



Sir 50:1 It was the High Priest Simon son of Onias who repaired the Temple during his lifetime and in his day
fortified the sanctuary.

Sir 50:2 He laid the foundations of double depth, the high buttresses of the Temple precincts.

Sir 50:3 In his day the pool was excavated, a reservoir as huge as the sea.

Sir 50:4 Anxious to save the people from ruin, he fortified the city against siege.

Sir 50:5 How splendid he was with the people thronging round him, when he emerged from the curtained shrine,
Sir 50:6 like the morning star among the clouds, like the moon at the full,

Sir 50:7 like the sun shining on the Temple of the Most High, like the rainbow gleaming against brilliant clouds,
Sir 50:8 like a rose in springtime, like a lily by a spring, like a branch of the incense tree in summer,

Sir 50:9 like fire and incense in the censer, like a massive golden vessel encrusted with every kind of precious
stone,

Sir 50:10 like an olive tree loaded with fruit, like a cypress soaring to the clouds;

Sir 50:1 1 when he took his ceremonial robe and put on his magnificent ornaments, when he went up to the holy
altar and filled the sanctuary precincts with his grandeur;

Sir 50:12 when he received the portions from the hands of the priests, himself standing by the altar hearth,
crowned with the circle of his brothers, as a cedar of Lebanon is by its foliage, as though surrounded by the
trunks of palm trees.

Sir 50:13 When all the sons of Aaron in their glory, with the offerings of the Lord in their hands, stood before the
whole assembly of Israel,

Sir 50:14 while he completed the rites at the altars, nobly presenting the offerings to the Almighty, Most High!

Sir 50:15 He would reach out his hand to the cup and pour a libation of wine, pouring it at the foot of the altar, a
fragrance pleasing to the Most High, King of All;

Sir 50:16 then the sons of Aaron would shout and blow their metal trumpets, making a mighty sound ring out as
a reminder before the Most High;

Sir 50:17 and immediately the people all together would fall on their faces to the ground, in adoration of their
Lord, the Almighty, God Most High,

Sir 50:18 and with the cantors chanting their hymns of praise. Sweet was the melody of all these voices,

Sir 50:19 as the people pleaded with the Lord Most High and prayed in the presence of the Merciful, until the
service of the Lord was completed and the ceremony at an end.

Sir 50:20 Then he would come down and raise his hands over the whole assembly of the Israelites, to give them
the Lord’s blessing from his lips, being privileged to pronounce his name;

Sir 50:21 and once again the people would bow low to receive the blessing of the Most High.

Sir 50:22 And now bless the God of all things, the doer of great deeds everywhere, who has exalted our days
from the womb and has acted mercifully towards us.

Sir 50:23 May he grant us cheerful hearts and bring peace in our time, in Israel for ages on ages.

Sir 50:24 May his mercy be faithfully with us, may he redeem us in our own times!

Sir 50:25 There are two nations that my soul detests, the third is not a nation at all:

Sir 50:26 the inhabitants of Mount Seir, the Philistines, and the stupid people living at Shechem.

Sir 50:27 Instruction in wisdom and knowledge is what has been written in this book by Jesus son of Sira
Eleazar of Jerusalem, who has poured a rain of wisdom from his heart.

Sir 50:28 Blessed is he who devotes his time to these and grows wise by taking them to heart!

Sir 50:29 If he practises them he will be strong enough for anything, since the light of the Lord is his path.

Sir 51:1 I shall give thanks to you, Lord and King, and praise you, God my Saviour, I give thanks to your name;
Sir 51 :2 for you have been my guard and support and redeemed my body from destruction, from the snare of
the lying tongue, from lips that fabricate falsehood; in the presence of my assailants, you were on my side; you
have been my support, you have redeemed me,

Sir 51 :3 true to your abounding kindness — and the greatness of your name — you liberated me from the fangs
of those seeking to devour me, from the clutches of those seeking my life, from the many ordeals which I have
endured,

Sir 51 :4 from the stifling heat which hemmed me in, from the heart of a fire which I had not kindled,

Sir 51 :5 from deep in the belly of Sheol,

Sir 51 :6 treacherous denunciations to the king. My soul has been close to death, my life had gone down to the
brink of Sheol.

Sir 51 :7 I was completely surrounded, there was no one to help me; I looked for someöne to help me, there was
no one.

Sir 51 :8 Then I remembered your mercy, Lord, and your deeds from earliest times, how you deliver those who
wait for you patiently, and save them from the clutches of their enemies.

Sir 51 :9 And I sent up my plea from the earth, I begged to be delivered from death.

Sir 51:10 I called on the Lord, the father of my Lord, “Do not desert me in the days of ordeal, in the days of the



proud, when we are helpless. I shall praise your name unceasingly and gratefully sing its praises”.

Sir 51:11 And my plea was heard, for you saved me from destruction, you delivered me from that time of evil.

Sir 51:12 And therefore I shall thank you and praise you, and bless the name of the Lord.

Sir 51:13 When I was still a youth, before I went travelling, in my prayers I asked outright for wisdom.

Sir 51:14 Outside the sanctuary I would pray for her, and to the last I shall continue to seek her.

Sir 51:15 From her blossoming to the ripening of her grape my heart has taken its delight in her. My foot has
pursued a straight path, I have sought her ever since my youth.

Sir 51:16 By bowing my ear a little, I have received her, and have found much instruction.

Sir 51:17 Thanks to her I have advanced; glory be to him who has given me wisdom!

Sir 51:18 For I was determined to put her into practice, have earnestly pursued the good, and shall not be put to
shame.

Sir 51:19 My soul has fought to possess her, I have been scrupulous in keeping the Law; I have stretched out
my hands to heaven and bewailed how little I knew of her;

Sir 51 :20 I have directed my soul towards her, and in purity I have found her; having my heart fixed on her from
the outset, I shall never be deserted;

Sir 51 :21 my very core having yearned to discover her, I have now acquired a good possession.

Sir 51 :22 In reward the Lord has given me a tongue with which I shall sing his praises.

Sir 51 :23 Come close to me, you ignorant, take your place in my school.

Sir 51 :24 Why complain about lacking these things when your souls are so thirsty for them?

Sir 51 :25 I have opened my mouth, I have said: “Buy her without money,

Sir 51 :26 put your necks under her yoke, let your souls receive instruction, she is near, within your reach”.

Sir 51 :27 See for yourselves: how slight my efforts have been to win so much peace.

Sir 51 :28 Buy instruction with a large sum of silver, thanks to her you will gain much gold.

Sir 51 :29 May your souls rejoice in the mercy of the Lord, may you never be ashamed of praising him.

Sir 51 :30 Do your work before the appointed time and at the appointed time he will give you your reward.

Hag 1:1 In the second year of King Darius, on the first day of the sixth month, the word of Yahweh was
addressed through the prophet Haggai to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel governor of Judah and to Joshua son of
Jehozadak the high priest as follows,

Hag 1:2 “Yahweh Sabaoth says this, ‘This people says: The time has not yet come to rebuild the Temple of
Yahweh’”.

Hag 1:3 (And the word of Yahweh was addressed through the prophet Haggai, as follows,)

Hag 1 :4 “Is this a time for you to live in your panelled houses, when this House lies in ruins?

Hag 1:5 So now, Yahweh Sabaoth says this, ‘Think carefully about your behaviour.

Hag 1:6 You have sown much and harvested little; you eat but never have enough, drink but never have your
fill, put on clothes but feel no warmth. The wage-earner gets his wages only to put them in a bag with a hole in
it.”

Hag 1:7 Yahweh Sabaoth says this, ‘Think carefully about your behaviour.

Hag 1 :8 Go up into the hills, fetch timber and rebuild the House; and I shall take pleasure in it and manifest my
glory there — Yahweh says.

Hag 1:9 The abundance you expected proved to be little. When you brought the harvest in, I blasted it. And
why? - Yahweh Sabaoth declares. Because while my House lies in ruins, each of you is busy with his own
house.

Hag 1:10 That is why the sky has withheld the rain and the earth withheld its yield.

Hag 1:11 I have called down drought on land and hills, on grain, on new wine, on olive oil and on all the produce
of the ground, on humans and animals and all your labours’”.

Hag 1:12 Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Joshua son of Jehozadak the high priest and the entire remnant of the
people, paid attention to the voice of Yahweh their God and to the words of the prophet Haggai, which Yahweh
their God had sent him to deliver. And the people were filled with fear before Yahweh.

Hag 1:13 Haggai, the messenger of Yahweh, then passed on Yahweh’s message to the people, “I am with you
— declares Yahweh”.

Hag 1:14 And Yahweh roused the spirit of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel governor of Judah, the spirit of Joshua
son of Jehozadak the high priest and the spirit of the entire remnant of the people; they came and set to work in
the Temple of Yahweh Sabaoth, their God.

Hag 1:15 This was on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month. In the second year of King Darius,

Hag 2:1 on the twenty-first day of the seventh month, the word of Yahweh was addressed through the prophet
Haggai, as follows,

Hag 2:2 “You are to speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel governor of Judah, to Joshua son of Jehozadak the
high priest and to the remnant of the people. Say this,

Hag 2:3 ‘Is there anyone left among you who saw this Temple in its former glory? And how does it look to you
now? Does it not seem as though there is nothing there?

Hag 2:4 But take courage now, Zerubbabell-Yahweh declares. Courage, Joshua son of Jehozadak high priest!
Courage, all you people of the countryl-Yahweh declares. To work! I am with you — Yahweh Sabaoth declares-
Hag 2:5 and my spirit is present among you. Do not be afraid!

Hag 2:6 For Yahweh Sabaoth says this: A little while now, and I shall shake the heavens and the earth, the sea
and the dry land.

Hag 2:7 I shall shake all the nations, and the treasures of all the nations will flow in, and I shall fill this Temple
with glory, says Yahweh Sabaoth.

Hag 2:8 Mine is the silver, mine the gold!-Yahweh Sabaoth declares.

Hag 2:9 The glory of this new Temple will surpass that of the old, says Yahweh Sabaoth, and in this place I shall
give peace — Yahweh Sabaoth declares’”.

Hag 2:10 On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of Yahweh was
addressed to the prophet Haggai as follows,

Hag 2:1 1 “Yahweh Sabaoth says this, ‘Ask the priests to give a ruling on this:

Hag 2:12 If someöne is carrying consecrated meat in the fold of his gown and allows the fold to touch bread,
broth, wine, oil or food of any kind, will that become holy?’”. The priests replied, “No”.

Hag 2:13 Haggai then said, “If anyone rendered unclean by contact with a corpse touches any of these things,
will that become unclean?”. The priests replied, “It will become unclean”.

Hag 2:14 Haggai then spoke out. “It is the same with this people”, he said, “the same with this nation, in my view
— Yahweh declares — the same with everything they turn their hands to; and whatever they offer here is unclean.
Hag 2:15 “So now think carefully, today and henceforth: before one stone had been laid on another in the



sanctuary of Yahweh,

Hag 2:16 what state were you in? You would come to a twenty-measure heap and find only ten; you would
come to a vat to draw fifty measures and find only twenty.

Hag 2:17 Everything you turned your hands to, I struck with wind-blast, mildew and hail, and still you would not
return to me — Yahweh declares.

Hag 2:18 So think carefully, today and henceforth (from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, from the day
the foundation of the sanctuary of Yahweh was laid, think carefully)

Hag 2:19 if seed-corn is still short in the barn, and if vine and fig tree, pomegranate and olive tree still bear no
fruit. “From today onwards I intend to bless you”.

Hag 2:20 On the twenty-fourth day of the month the word of Yahweh was addressed a second time to Haggai,
as follows,

Hag 2:21 “Speak to Zerubbabel governor of Judah. Say this, ‘I am going to shake the heavens and the earth.
Hag 2:22 I shall overturn the thrones of kingdoms and destroy the power of the kings of the nations. I shall
overthrow the chariots and their crews; horses and their riders will fall, every one to the sword of his comrade.
Hag 2:23 When that day comes — Yahweh Sabaoth declares — 1 shall take you, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel my
servant — Yahweh declares — and make you like a signet ring. For I have chosen you — Yahweh Sabaoth
declares’”.

Zee 1:1 In the second year of Darius, in the eighth month, the word of Yahweh was addressed to the prophet
Zechariah (son of Berechiah), son of Iddo, as follows,

Zee 1 :2 “Yahweh was deeply angry with your ancestors.

Zee 1:3 So say this to them, ‘Yahweh Sabaoth says this: Return to me — Yahweh Sabaoth declares — and I will
return to you, says Yahweh Sabaoth.

Zee 1 :4 Do not be like your ancestors when the prophets in the past cried to them: Yahweh Sabaoth says this:
Turn back from your evil ways and evil deeds — they would not listen or pay attention to me — Yahweh declares.
Zee 1 :5 Where are your ancestors now? And the prophets, do they live for ever?

Zee 1:6 But did not my words and statutes, with which I had charged my servants the prophets, overtake your
ancestors just the same?’”. So they repented and said, “Yahweh Sabaoth has treated us as he resolved to do,
and as our ways and deeds deserved”.

Zee 1 :7 On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month (the month of Shebat), in the second year of Darius, the
word of Yahweh was addressed to the prophet Zechariah (son of Berechiah), son of Iddo, as follows,

Zee 1:8 “I had a vision during the night. There was a man riding a red horse standing among the deep-rooted
myrtles; behind him were other horses-red, chestnut and white.

Zee 1 :9 I said, ‘What are these, my lord?’. And the angel who was talking to me said, ‘I will show you what they
are’.

Zee 1:10 The man standing among the myrtles then replied, ‘Those are they whom Yahweh has sent to patrol
the world’.

Zee 1:11 They reported to the angel of Yahweh as he stood among the myrtles, ‘We have been patrolling the
world, and indeed the whole world is still and at peace’.

Zee 1:12 The angel of Yahweh then spoke and said, ‘Yahweh Sabaoth, how long will you wait before taking pity
on Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, on which you have inflicted your anger for the past seventy years?’.

Zee 1:13 Yahweh then replied with kind and comforting words to the angel who was talking to me.

Zee 1:14 The angel who was talking to me then said to me, ‘Make this proclamation: Yahweh Sabaoth says
this: I am burning with jealousy for Jerusalem and Zion

Zee 1:15 but am deeply angry with the nations now at ease; before, I was only mildly angry, but they contributed
to the disaster.

Zee 1:16 So now Yahweh says this: In compassion I have returned to Jerusalem; my Temple will be rebuilt
there — Yahweh Sabaoth declares — and the measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.

Zee 1:17 Make this proclamation too: Yahweh Sabaoth says this: My cities are once more to be very
prosperous. Yahweh will comfort Zion once again, and again make Jerusalem his choice’”.

Zee 2:1 Then, raising my eyes, I had a vision. It was this: There were four horns.

Zee 2:2 I said to the angel who was talking to me, “What are these?”. He said to me, “These are the horns which
scattered Judah (Israel) and Jerusalem”.

Zee 2:3 Yahweh then showed me four smiths.

Zee 2:4 And I said, “What are these coming to do?”. He said to me, “(Those horns scattered Judah so completely
that no one dared to raise his head; but) these have come to terrify them, to throw down the horns of the nations
who raised their horns over the land of Judah to scatter it”.

Zee 2:5 Then, raising my eyes, I had a vision. There was a man with a measuring line in his hand.

Zee 2:6 I asked him, “Where are you going?”. He said, “To measure Jerusalem, to calculate her width and length”.
Zee 2:7 And then, while the angel who was talking to me walked away, another angel came out to meet him.



Zee 2:8 He said to him, “Run, and tell that young man this, ‘Jerusalem is to remain unwalled, because of the
great number of men and cattle inside.

Zee 2:9 For I — Yahweh declares — shall be a wall of fire all round her and I shall be the Glory within her’”.

Zee 2:10 Look out! Look out! Flee from the land of the north — Yahweh declares- for I have scattered you to the
four winds of heaven — Yahweh declares.

Zee 2:1 1 Look out! Make your escape, Zion, now living with the daughter of Babylon!

Zee 2:12 For Yahweh Sabaoth says this, since the Glory commissioned me, about the nations who plundered
you, “Whoëver touches you touches the apple of my eye.

Zee 2:13 Now look, I shall wave my hand over them and they will be plundered by those whom they have
enslaved”. Then you will know that Yahweh Sabaoth has sent me!

Zee 2:14 Sing, rejoice, daughter of Zion, for now I am coming to live among you -Yahweh declares!

Zee 2:15 And on that day many nations will be converted to Yahweh. Yes, they will become his people, and they
will live among you. Then you will know that Yahweh Sabaoth has sent me to you!

Zee 2:16 Yahweh will take possession of Judah, his portion in the Holy Land, and again make Jerusalem his
choice.

Zee 2:17 Let all people be silent before Yahweh, now that he is stirring from his holy Dwelling!

Zee 3:1 He then showed me the high priest Joshua, standing before the angel of Yahweh, with Satan standing
on his right to accuse him.

Zee 3:2 The angel of Yahweh said to Satan, “May Yahweh rebuke you, Satan! May Yahweh rebuke you, since
he has made Jerusalem his choice. Is not this man a brand snatched from the fire?”.

Zee 3:3 Now Joshua was dressed in dirty clothes as he stood before the angel.

Zee 3:4 The latter then spoke as follows to those who were standing before him, “Take off his dirty clothesand
dress him in splendid robes

Zee 3:5 and put a clean turban on his head”. So they put a clean turban on his head and dressed him in clean
clothes, while the angel of Yahweh stood byand said, “You see, I have taken your guilt away”.

Zee 3:6 The angel of Yahweh then made this declaration to Joshua,

Zee 3:7 “Yahweh Sabaoth says this, ‘If you walk in my ways and keep my ordinances, you shall govern my
house, you shall watch over my courts, and I will give you free access among those in attendance here.

Zee 3:8 “So listen, High Priest Joshua, you and the colleagues over whom you preside — for they are an omen
of things to come — for now I shall bring in my servant the Branch, and I shall remove this country’s guilt in a
single day.

Zee 3:9 For this is the stone which I have put before Joshua, a stone on which are seven eyes; and I myself
shall cut the inscription on it — Yahweh Sabaoth declares’.

Zee 3:10 On that day — Yahweh Sabaoth declares — invite each other to come under your vine and your fig
tree’”.

Zee 4:1 The angel who was talking to me came back and roused me as though rousing someöne who was
asleep.

Zee 4:2 And he asked me, “What do you see?”. I replied, “As I look, there is a lamp-stand entirely of gold with a
bowl at the top of it; it holds seven lamps, with seven openings for the lamps on it.

Zee 4:3 By it are two olive trees, one to the right and the other to the left”.

Zee 4:4 I then said to the angel who was talking to me, “What are those things, my lord?”.

Zee 4:5 The angel who was talking to me replied, “Do you not know what they are?”. I said, “No, my lord”.

Zee 4:6 He then gave me this answer, “These seven are the eyes of Yahweh, which range over the whole world”.
Zee 4:7 “What are you, great mountain? Beside Zerubbabel you shall become a plain! He will bring out the
keystone while it is cheered with Hurrah! Hurrah!”.

Zee 4:8 The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Zee 4:9 “The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this Temple; his hands will finish it. (Then you will
know that Yahweh Sabaoth has sent me to you.)

Zee 4: 1 0 A day of little things, no doubt, but who would dare despise it? How they will rejoice when they see the
chosen stone in the hands of Zerubbabel!”.

Zee 4:1 1 Then I went on to ask him, “What is the meaning of these two olive trees, to right and left of the lamp-
stand?”.

Zee 4: 1 2 (And I went on to ask him further, “What is the meaning of the two olive branches discharging oil
through the two golden openings?')

Zee 4:13 He replied, “Do you not know what they are?”. I said, “No, my lord”.

Zee 4:14 He said, “These are the two anointed ones in attendance on the Lord of the whole world. This is the
word of Yahweh with regard to Zerubbabel, “Not by might and not by power, but by my spirit” — says Yahweh
Sabaoth.

Zee 5:1 Again raising my eyes, I had a vision. There was a flying scroll.



Zee 5:2 The angel who was talking to me said, “What do you see?”. I replied, “I see a flying scroll; it is twenty
cubits long and ten cubits wide”.

Zee 5:3 He then said to me, “This is God’s curse sweeping across the face of the whole country; for, according
to what it says on one side, every thief will be banished and, according to what it says on the other, everyone
who commits perjury in my name will be banished from it.

Zee 5:4 I am going to release it — Yahweh Sabaoth declares — for it to enter the house of the thief and of
anyone who commits perjury in my name, for it to settle deep within his house and consume it, timber, stone and
all”.

Zee 5:5 The angel who was talking to me appeared and said to me, “Raise your eyes, and see what this is,
going along”.

Zee 5:6 I said, “What is it?”. He said, “It is a bushel measure going along”. He went on, “This is their guilt
throughout the country”.

Zee 5:7 At this, a disc of lead was raised, and I saw a woman sitting inside the barrel.

Zee 5:8 He said, “This is Wickedness”. And he rammed her back into the barrel and jammed its mouth shut with
the mass of lead.

Zee 5:9 I raised my eyes, and there were two women appearing. The wind caught their wings — they had wings
like a stork's; they raised the barrel midway between earth and heaven.

Zee 5:10 I then said to the angel who was talking to me, “Where are they taking the barrel?”.

Zee 5:1 1 He replied, “To build a temple for it in the land of Shinar and make a pedestal on which to put it”.

Zee 6:1 Again I raised my eyes, and this is what I saw: four chariots coming out between two mountains, and
the mountains were mountains of bronze.

Zee 6:2 The first chariot had red horses, the second chariot had black horses,

Zee 6:3 the third chariot had white horses and the fourth chariot had vigorous, piebald horses.

Zee 6:4 I asked the angel who was talking to me, “What are these, my lord?”.

Zee 6:5 The angel replied, “They are the four winds of heaven now leaving, after attending the Lord of the whole
world.

Zee 6:6 The black horses are leaving for the land of the north; the white are following them, and the piebald are
leaving for the land of the south”.

Zee 6:7 They came out vigorously, eager to patrol the world. He said to them, “Go and patrol the world”. And
they patrolled the world.

Zee 6:8 He called to me and said, “Look, the ones going to the land of the north brought my spirit to rest on the
land of the north”.

Zee 6:9 Then the word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,

Zee 6:10 “Collect silver and gold from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah and Jedaiah, then (you yourself go the
same day) go to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah, who has arrived from Babylon.

Zee 6:1 1 Then, taking the silver and gold, make a crown and place it on the head of the high priest Joshua son
of Jehozadak.

Zee 6:12 And say this to him, ‘Yahweh Sabaoth says this: Here is a man whose name is Branch; where he is,
there will be a branching out (and he will rebuild Yahweh’s sanctuary).

Zee 6:13 Yes, he is the one who will rebuild Yahweh’s sanctuary; he will wear the royal insignia and sit on his
throne and govern, with a priest on his right. Perfect peace will reign between these two.

Zee 6:14 And the crown will serve Heldai, Tobijah, Jedaiah and the son of Zephaniah as a memorial of favour in
Yahweh’s sanctuary.

Zee 6: 1 5 And those now far away will come and work on the building of Yahweh’s sanctuary’. “Then you will
know that Yahweh Sabaoth has sent me to you. It will happen if you diligently obey the voice of Yahweh your
God”.

Zee 7:1 In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of Yahweh was addressed to Zechariah on the fourth day of
the ninth month, the month of Chislev.

Zee 7:2 Bethel sent Sharezer with a deputation to entreat Yahweh’s favour

Zee 7:3 and to ask the priests in the Temple of Yahweh Sabaoth and the prophets, “Ought I to go on mourning
and fasting in the fifth month as I have been doing for so many years past?”.

Zee 7:4 Then the word of Yahweh Sabaoth was addressed to me as follows,

Zee 7:5 “Say to all the people of the country and to the priests, ‘While you have been fasting and mourning in
the fifth and seventh months for the past seventy years, have you really been fasting for my sake?

Zee 7:6 And when you were eating and drinking, were you not eating and drinking for your own sake?

Zee 7:7 Do you not know the words which Yahweh proclaimed through the prophets in the past, when
Jerusalem was inhabited and secure, as were her surrounding towns, and when the Negeb and the lowlands
were inhabited?’”. (

Zee 7:8 The word of Yahweh was addressed to Zechariah as follows,



Zee 7:9 “Yahweh Sabaoth says this.) He said, ‘Apply the law fairly, and show faithful love and compassion
towards one another.

Zee 7:10 Do not oppress the widow and the orphan, the foreigner and the poor, and do not secretly plan evil
against one another’.

Zee 7:1 1 But they would not listen; they turned a rebellious shoulder; they stopped their ears rather than hear;
Zee 7:12 they made their hearts adamant rather than listen to the teaching and the words that Yahweh Sabaoth
had sent — by his spirit — through the prophets in the past; and consequently the fury of Yahweh Sabaoth
overtook them.

Zee 7:13 And so, since when he called they would not listen, ‘I would not listen when they called’, says Yahweh
Sabaoth,

Zee 7:14 ‘but scattered them among all the nations unknown to them. Hence, after they had gone, the country
was deserted, and no one came or went. They had turned a land of delights into a desert’”.

Zee 8:1 The word of Yahweh Sabaoth came as follows:

Zee 8:2 Yahweh Sabaoth says this: I have been burning with jealousy for Zion, with furious jealousy for her
sake.

Zee 8:3 Yahweh says this: I am coming back to Zion and shall live in the heart of Jerusalem. Jerusalem will be
called Faithful City and the mountain of Yahweh Sabaoth, the Holy Mountain.

Zee 8:4 Yahweh Sabaoth says this: Aged men and women once again will sit in the squares of Jerusalem, each
with a stick to lean on because of their great age.

Zee 8:5 And the squares of the city will be full of boys and girls playing there.

Zee 8:6 Yahweh Sabaoth says this: If this seems a miracle to the remnant of this people (in those days), will it
seem one to me? declares Yahweh.

Zee 8:7 Yahweh Sabaoth says this: Look, I shall rescue my people from the countries of the east and from the
countries of the west.

Zee 8:8 I shall bring them back to live in the heart of Jerusalem, and they will be my people and I shall be their
God, faithful and just.

Zee 8:9 “Yahweh Sabaoth says this, ‘Take heart, you who today hear these promises uttered by the prophets
since the day when the foundations of the Temple of Yahweh Sabaoth were laid, that the sanctuary would
indeed be rebuilt.

Zee 8:10 For up to now, men were not paid their wages and nothing was paid for the animals either; and it has
not been safe for anyone to come and go, because of the enemy, since I had set each one against everyone
else.

Zee 8:1 1 But from now on, I shall not treat the remnant of this people as I have treated them in time past —
declares Yahweh Sabaoth.

Zee 8:12 Now they will sow in peace; the vine will give its fruit, the soil will give its produce and heaven will give
its dew. I shall bestow all these on the remnant of this people.

Zee 8:13 Just as once you were a curse among the nations, House of Judah and House of Israel, so now I shall
save you, and you will be a blessing. Do not be afraid. Take heart!’.

Zee 8:14 “For Yahweh Sabaoth says this, ‘Just as I resolved to ill-treat you when your ancestors provoked me to
anger and did not relent — says Yahweh Sabaoth-

Zec 8:15 so now I have changed my mind and intend to treat Jerusalem and the House of Judah well. Do not be
afraid!

Zee 8: 1 6 ‘These are the things that you must do. Speak the truth to one another; at your gates, administer fair
judgement conducive to peace;

Zee 8:17 do not secretly plot evil against one another; do not love perjury; since I hate all this — Yahweh
declares’. ’

Zee 8:18 The word of Yahweh Sabaoth was addressed to me as follows:

Zee 8:19 “Yahweh Sabaoth says this, ‘The fast of the fourth month, the fast of the fifth, the fast of the seventh
and the fast of the tenth are to become glad, joyful, happy festivals for the House of Judah. So love truth and
peace!’”.

Zee 8:20 “Yahweh Sabaoth says this, ‘In the future, peoples and citizens of many cities will come;

Zee 8:21 and citizens of one city will go to the next and say: We must certainly go to entreat Yahweh’s favour
and seek out Yahweh Sabaoth; I am going myself.

Zee 8:22 Yes, many peoples and great nations will seek out Yahweh Sabaoth in Jerusalem and entreat
Yahweh’s favour’.

Zee 8:23 “Yahweh Sabaoth says this, ‘In those days, ten men from nations of every language will take a Jew by
the sleeve and say: We want to go with you, since we have learnt that God is with you’”.

Zee 9:1 A proclamation. The word of Yahweh is against Hadrach, it has come to rest on Damascus, for the
source of Aram belongs to Yahweh no less than all the tribes of Israel;



Zee 9:2 on Hamath too, which borders on it, and on (Tyre and) Sidon, despite her acumen.

Zee 9:3 Tyre has built herself a fortress, has heaped up silver like dust and gold like the dirt of the streets.

Zee 9:4 And now the Lord is going to dispossess her; at sea he will break her power, and she herself will go up
in flames.

Zee 9:5 Seeing this, Ashkelon will be terrified, Gaza too, and writhe with grief, Ekron too, at the ruin of her
prospects; the king will vanish from Gaza and Ashkelon be unpeopled,

Zee 9:6 while a half-breed will live in Ashdod! Yes, I shall destroy the pride of the Philistine;

Zee 9:7 I shall snatch his blood from his mouth, his abominations from between his teeth. But his remnant too
will belong to our God, becoming like a clan in Judah, and Ekron will become like a Jebusite.

Zee 9:8 I shall stand guard before my home to defend it against all comers, and no oppressor will overrun them
ever again, for now I am on the alert.

Zee 9:9 Rejoice heart and soul, daughter of Zion! Shout for joy, daughter of Jerusalem! Look, your king is
approaching, he is vindicated and victorious, humble and riding on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey.

Zee 9:10 He will banish chariots from Ephraim and horses from Jerusalem; the bow of war will be banished. He
will proclaim peace to the nations, his empire will stretch from sea to sea, from the River to the limits of the earth.
Zee 9:1 1 As for you, because of the blood of your covenant I have released your prisoners from the pit in which
there is no water.

Zee 9:12 Come back to the fortress, you prisoners waiting in hope. This very day, I vow, I shall make it up to you
twice over.

Zee 9:13 For I have strung Judah as a bow for myself, laid Ephraim on the string as an arrow, have roused your
sons, Zion, against your sons, Javan, and have made you like a warrior’s sword.

Zee 9:14 Then Yahweh will appear above them and his arrow will flash out like lightning. (The Lord) Yahweh will
sound the trumpet and advance in the storm-winds of the south.

Zee 9:15 Yahweh Sabaoth will protect them! They will devour, will trample on the sling-stones, they will drink
blood like wine, awash like bowls, like the corners of the altar.

Zee 9:16 Yahweh their God will give them victory when that day comes, like the sheep who are his people; yes,
the stones of a diadem will sparkle over his country.

Zee 9:17 How fine, how splendid that will be, with wheat to make the young men flourish, and new wine the
maidens!

Zee 10:1 Ask Yahweh for rain in autumn and at the time of the spring rains. Yahweh is the one to make the
storm-clouds. He will give them showers of rain; to each, grass in his field.

Zee 10:2 Since the domestic idols have talked nonsense, and the diviners have seen false signs, and dreams
have purveyed delusions, affording empty comfort, that is why they have strayed like sheep, in distress for want
of a shepherd.

Zee 10:3 My anger has been roused by the shepherds, and I shall vent it on the he-goats. When Yahweh
Sabaoth comes to visit his flock, the House of Judah, he will make it his royal war-horse.

Zee 10:4 From it will emerge Cornerstone and Tent-peg, from it, Bow-ready-for-Battle, from it, every type of
leader. Together

Zee 10:5 they will be like warriors trampling the dirt of the streets in battle; when they fight, because Yahweh is
with them, they will put mounted men to rout.

Zee 10:6 Then I shall make the House of Judah mighty and the House of Joseph victorious. I shall restore them,
because I have taken pity on them, and they will be as though I had never cast them off, for I am Yahweh their
God and shall answer their prayer.

Zee 10:7 Ephraim will be like a warrior. Their hearts will be cheered as though by wine. Their children will see
this and rejoice, their hearts will exult in Yahweh.

Zee 10:8 I shall whistle to them and gather them in, for I have redeemed them; they will be as numerous as they
used to be.

Zee 10:9 I shall scatter them among the peoples but in distant countries they will remember me, they will instruct
their children and then return.

Zee 10:10 I shall bring them home from Egypt and gather them back from Assyria; I shall lead them into Gilead
and the Lebanon, and even that will not be large enough for them.

Zee 10:1 1 They will cross the sea of Egypt (and the waves of the sea will be struck); all the depths of the River
will be dried up. The arrogance of Assyria will be cast down and the sceptre of Egypt taken away.

Zee 10:12 I shall make them mighty in Yahweh, and they will march in my name — Yahweh declares.

Zee 11:1 Open your gateways, Lebanon, and the fire shall burn down your cedar trees!

Zee 1 1 :2 Wail, juniper, for the cedar tree has fallen, the majestic ones have been ravaged! Wail, oaks of
Bashan, for the impenetrable forest has been felled!

Zee 1 1 :3 The sound of the wailing of shepherds! Their majesty has been ravaged. The sound of the roaring of
young lions! The pride of the Jordan has been ravaged.



Zee 1 1 :4 Yahweh my God says this, “Pasture the sheep for slaughter,

Zee 1 1 :5 whose buyers kill them and go unpunished, whose sellers say of them, ‘Blessed be Yahweh; now I am
rich!’. and whose own shepherds show them no pity.

Zee 1 1 :6 For I shall show no further pity for the inhabitants of the country — Yahweh declares! Instead, I shall
put everyone into the clutches of a neighbour, into the clutches of the king. They will crush the country and I shall
not rescue anyone from their clutches”.

Zee 1 1 :7 Then I pastured for slaughter the sheep belonging to the sheep-dealers. I took two staves: the one I
called “Goodwill”, the other “Couplers”; and I pastured the sheep myself,

Zee 1 1 :8 getting rid of three shepherds in one month. But I lost patience with them, and they equally detested
me.

Zee 11:91 then said, “I am not going to pasture you any more; the one doomed to die can die; the one doomed
to perish can perish; and the rest can devour one another”.

Zee 11:10 I then took my staff, “Goodwill”, and broke it in half, to break my covenant, which I had made with all
the peoples.

Zee 11:11 When it was broken, that day the sheep-dealers, who were watching me, realised that this had been
a word of Yahweh.

Zee 11:12 I then said to them, “If you see fit, give me my wages; if not, never mind”. So they weighed out my
wages: thirty shekels of silver.

Zee 11:13 Yahweh said to me, “Throw it to the smelter, this princely sum at which they have valued me!”. Taking
the thirty shekels of silver, I threw them into the Temple of Yahweh, for the smelter.

Zee 11:14 I then broke my second staff, “Couplers”, in half, to rupture the brotherly relationship between Judah
and Israel.

Zee 11:15 Next, Yahweh said to me, “This time, take the gear of a good-for-nothing shepherd.

Zee 11:16 For I am now going to raise a shepherd in this country, who will not bother about the lost, who will not
go in search of the stray, who will not heal the injured, who will not support the swollen, but who will eat the meat
of the fat ones, tearing off their very hoofs.

Zee 11:17 Disaster to the shepherd who deserts his flock! May the sword attack his arm and his right eye! May
his arm shrivel completely and his right eye be totally blinded!”.

Zee 12:1 A proclamation. The word of Yahweh about Israel (and also about Judah). Yahweh, who spread out
the heaven and founded the earth and formed the human spirit within, declares:

Zee 12:2 “Look, I shall make Jerusalem a cup to set all the surrounding peoples reeling. (That will be at the time
of the siege of Jerusalem.)

Zee 12:3 “When that day comes, I shall make Jerusalem a stone too heavy for all the peoples to lift; all those
who try to lift it will hurt themselves severely, although all the nations of the world will be massed against her.

Zee 12:4 When that day comes — declares Yahweh - I shall strike all the horses with panic and their riders with
madness. And I shall strike all the peoples with blindness. (But I shall keep watch over Judah.)

Zee 12:5 Then the rulers of Judah will say to themselves, ‘The strength of the inhabitants of Jerusalem lies in
Yahweh Sabaoth their God’.

Zee 12:6 When that day comes, I shall make the rulers of Judah like a brazier burning in a pile of wood, like a
torch flaming in a sheaf; and they will devour all the peoples round them to right and left. And Jerusalem will be
full of people as before, where she stands (in Jerusalem).

Zee 12:7 Yahweh will first save the tents of Judah, so that the glory of the House of David and the glory of the
inhabitants of Jerusalem do not increase at Judah’s expense.

Zee 12:8 When that day comes, Yahweh will protect the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and the frailest of them will be
like David when that day comes, and the House of David will be like God, like the angel of Yahweh, at their
head.

Zee 12:9 “When that day comes, I shall set about destroying all the nations who advance against Jerusalem.

Zee 12:10 But over the House of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem I shall pour out a spirit of grace and
prayer, and they will look to me. They will mourn for the one whom they have pierced as though for an only child,
and weep for him as people weep for a first-born child.

Zee 12:11 When that day comes, the mourning in Jerusalem will be as great as the mourning for Hadad
Rimmon in the Plain of Megiddo.

Zee 12:12 And the country will mourn clan by clan: The clan of the House of David by itself, and their women by
themselves; the clan of the House of Nathan by itself, and their women by themselves;

Zee 12:13 the clan of the House of Levi by itself, and their women by themselves; the clan of the House of
Shimei by itself, and their women by themselves;

Zee 12:14 all the rest of the clans, every clan by itself, and their women by themselves”.

Zee 13:1 “When that day comes, a fountain will be opened for the House of David and the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, to wash sin and impurity away.



Zee 13:2 “When that day comes — Yahweh declares — I shall cut off the names of the idols from the country, and
they will never be remembered again; I shall also rid the country of the prophets, and of the spirit of impurity.

Zee 13:3 Then, if anyone still goes on prophesying, his parents, his own father and mother will say to him, ‘You
shall not live, since you utter lies in Yahweh’s name’. And even while he is prophesying, his parents, his own
father and mother will pierce him through.

Zee 13:4 When that day comes, the prophets will all be ashamed to relate their visions when they prophesy and
no longer put on their hair cloaks with intent to deceive.

Zee 13:5 Instead, they will say, ‘I am no prophet. I am a man who tills the soil, for the land has been my living
since I was a boy’.

Zee 13:6 And if anyone asks him, ‘What are those gashes on your chest?’. he will reply, ‘I got them when I was
with my friends’”.

Zee 13:7 Awake, sword, against my shepherd, against the man who is close to me- declares Yahweh Sabaoth!
Strike the shepherd, scatter the sheep! And I shall turn my hand against the young!

Zee 13:8 So it will be, throughout the country- declares Yahweh Sabaoth- two-thirds in it will be cut off (be killed)
and the other third will be left.

Zee 13:9 I shall pass this third through the fire, refine them as silver is refined, test them as gold is tested. He
will call on my name and I shall answer him; I shall say, “He is my people”, and he will say, “Yahweh is my God!”.
Zee 14:1 Look, the Day of Yahweh is coming, when the spoils taken from you will be shared out among you.

Zee 14:2 For I shall gather all the nations to Jerusalem for battle. The city will be taken, the houses plundered,
the women ravished. Half the city will go into exile, but the rest of the people will not be ejected from the city.

Zee 14:3 Then Yahweh will sally out and fight those nations as once he fought on the day of battle.

Zee 14:4 When that day comes, his feet will rest on the Mount of Olives, which faces Jerusalem on the east,
and the Mount of Olives will be split in half from east to west, forming a huge valley; half the Mount will recede
northwards, the other half southwards.

Zee 14:5 The valley between the hills will be filled in, yes, it will be blocked as far as Jasol, it will be filled in as it
was by the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. And Yahweh my God will come, and all the holy
ones with him.

Zee 14:6 That Day, there will be no light, but only cold and frost.

Zee 14:7 And it will be one continuous day — Yahweh knows — there will be no more day and night, and it will
remain light right into the time of evening.

Zee 14:8 When that Day comes, living waters will issue from Jerusalem, half towards the eastern sea, half
towards the western sea; they will flow summer and winter.

Zee 14:9 Then Yahweh will become king of the whole world. When that Day comes, Yahweh will be the one and
only and his name the one name.

Zee 14:10 The entire country will be transformed into plain, from Geba to Rimmon in the Negeb, but Jerusalem
will stand high in her place and be full of people from the Benjamin Gate to the site of the earlier gate, to the
Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king’s wine-presses.

Zee 14:11 People will make their homes there. The curse of destruction will be lifted; Jerusalem will be safe to
live in.

Zee 14:12 And this is the plague with which Yahweh will strike all the nations who have fought against
Jerusalem; their flesh will rot while they are still standing on their feet; their eyes will rot in their sockets; their
tongues will rot in their mouths.

Zee 14:13 When that Day comes, a great terror will fall on them from Yahweh; each man will grab his
neighbour’s hand and they will fall to fighting among themselves.

Zee 14:14 Even Judah will fight against Jerusalem. The wealth of all the surrounding nations will be heaped
together: gold, silver, clothing, in vast quantity.

Zee 14:15 And the plague afflicting the horses, mules, camels, donkeys and all the other animals in those
armies will be the same.

Zee 14:16 After this, all the survivors of all the nations which have attacked Jerusalem will come up year after
year to worship the King, Yahweh Sabaoth, and to keep the feast of Shelters.

Zee 14:17 Should one of the races of the world fail to come up to Jerusalem to worship the King, Yahweh
Sabaoth, there will be no rain for that one.

Zee 14:18 Should the race of Egypt fail to come up and pay its visit, on it will fall the plague which Yahweh will
inflict on each of those nations which fail to come up to keep the feast of Shelters.

Zee 14:19 Such will be the punishment for Egypt and the punishment for all the nations which fail to come up to
keep the feast of Shelters.

Zee 14:20 When that Day comes, the very bells on the horses will be inscribed with the words, “Sacred to
Yahweh”, and the cooking pots of the house of Yahweh will be as holy as the sprinkling bowls before the altar.
Zee 14:21 Yes, every cooking pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be sacred to Yahweh Sabaoth, and all who



come to offer sacrifice will help themselves and do their cooking in them, and there will be no more traders in the
Temple of Yahweh Sabaoth, when that Day comes.

Mai 1:1 A message. The word of Yahweh to Israel through Malachi.

Mai 1 :2 “I have loved you, says Yahweh. But you ask, ‘How have you shown your love?’. Was not Esau Jacob’s
brother? declares Yahweh; even so, I loved Jacob

Mai 1 :3 but I hated Esau. I turned his mountains into a desert and his heritage into dwellings in the wastelands.
Mai 1 :4 If Edom says, ‘We have been struck down but we shall rebuild our ruins’, Yahweh Sabaoth says this,
‘Let them build, but I shall pull down! They will be known as Land of Wickedness and Nation-with-which-
Yahweh-is-angry-for-ever.

Mai 1:5 You will see this yourselves and you will say: Yahweh is mighty beyond the borders of Israel’.

Mai 1 :6 “The son honours his father, the slave stands in awe of his master. But if I am indeed father, where is
the honour due to me? And if I am indeed master, where is the awe due to me? says Yahweh Sabaoth to you
priests who despise my name. You ask, ‘How have we despised your name?’.

Mai 1:7 By putting polluted food on my altar. You ask, ‘How have we polluted you?’. By saying, ‘The table of
Yahweh deserves no respect’.

Mai 1 :8 When you bring blind animals for sacrifice, is this not wrong? When you bring the lame and the
diseased, is this not wrong? If you offer them to your governor, see if he is pleased with them or receives you
graciously, says Yahweh Sabaoth.

Mai 1 :9 In that case, try pleading with God to take pity on us (that is what you have done), and will he take any
notice? says Yahweh Sabaoth.

Mai 1:10 Why does one of you not close the doors and so stop the pointless lighting of fires on my altar? I am
not pleased with you, says Yahweh Sabaoth; from your hands I find no offerings acceptable.

Mai 1:11 But from farthest east to farthest west my name is great among the nations, and everywhere incense
and a pure gift are offered to my name, since my name is great among the nations, says Yahweh Sabaoth.

Mai 1:12 “But you have profaned it by saying, ‘The table of the Lord is polluted, hence the food offered on it
deserves no respect’.

Mai 1:13 You say, ‘How tiresome it all is!’. and sniff disdainfully at me, says Yahweh Sabaoth. You bring a
stolen, lame or diseased animal, you bring that as an offering! Am I to accept this from you? says Yahweh
Sabaoth.

Mai 1:14 Cursed be the rogue who has a male in his flock but pays his vow by sacrificing a blemished animal to
me! For I am a great king, says Yahweh Sabaoth, and among the nations my name inspires awe”.

Mai 2:1 “And now, priests, this commandment is for you.

Mai 2:2 If you will not listen, if you will not sincerely resolve to glorify my name, says Yahweh Sabaoth, I shall
certainly lay a curse on you and I shall curse your blessing. Indeed I will lay a curse, for none of you makes this
resolve.

Mai 2:3 Now, I am going to break your arm and throw offal in your faces — the offal of your solemn feasts — and
sweep you away with it.

Mai 2:4 Then you will know that I sent this commandment to you, to affirm my intention to maintain my covenant
with Levi, says Yahweh Sabaoth.

Mai 2:5 My covenant was with him — a covenant of life and peace, and these were what I gave him — a
covenant of respect, and he respected me and held my name in awe.

Mai 2:6 The law of truth was in his mouth and guilt was not found on his lips; he walked in peace and justice
with me and he converted many from sinning.

Mai 2:7 The priest’s lips ought to safeguard knowledge; his mouth is where the law should be sought, since he
is Yahweh Sabaoth’s messenger.

Mai 2:8 But you yourselves have turned aside from the way; you have caused many to lapse by your teaching.
Since you have destroyed the covenant of Levi, says Yahweh Sabaoth,

Mai 2:9 so I in my turn have made you contemptible and vile to the whole people, for not having kept my ways
and for being partial in applying the law.

Mai 2:10 “Is there not one Father of us all? Did not one God create us? Why, then, do we break faith with one
another, profaning the covenant of our ancestors?

Mai 2:11 Judah has broken faith; a detestable thing has been done in Israel and in Jerusalem. For Judah has
profaned Yahweh’s beloved sanctuary; he has married the daughter of an alien god.

Mai 2:12 May Yahweh deprive such an offender of witness and advocate in the tents of Jacob among those who
present offerings to Yahweh Sabaoth!

Mai 2:13 “And here is something else you do: you cover the altar of Yahweh with tears, with weeping and
wailing, because he now refuses to consider the offering or to accept it from you.

Mai 2:14 And you ask, ‘Why?’. Because Yahweh stands as witness between you and the wife of your youth,
with whom you have broken faith, even though she was your partner and your wife by covenant.



Mai 2:15 Did he not create a single being, having flesh and the breath of life? And what does this single being
seek? God — given offspring! Have respect for your own life then, and do not break faith with the wife of your
youth.

Mai 2:16 For I hate divorce, says Yahweh, God of Israel, and people concealing their cruelty under a cloak, says
Yahweh Sabaoth. Have respect for your own life then, and do not break faith.

Mai 2:17 “You have wearied Yahweh with your talk. You ask, ‘How have we wearied him?’. When you say, ‘Any
evil-doer is good as far as Yahweh is concerned; indeed he is delighted with them’; or when you say, ‘Where is
the God of fair judgement now?’.

Mai 3:1 “Look, I shall send my messenger to clear a way before me. And suddenly the Lord whom you seek will
come to his Temple; yes, the angel of the covenant, for whom you long, is on his way, says Yahweh Sabaoth.

Mai 3:2 Who will be able to resist the day of his coming? Who will remain standing when he appears? For he
will be like a refiner’s fire, like fullers’ alkali.

Mai 3:3 He will take his seat as refiner and purifier; he will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and
silver, so that they can make the offering to Yahweh with uprightness.

Mai 3:4 The offering of Judah and Jerusalem will then be acceptable to Yahweh as in former days, as in the
years of old.

Mai 3:5 I am coming to put you on trial and I shall be a ready witness against sorcerers, adulterers, perjurers,
and against those who oppress the wage-earner, the widow and the orphan, and who rob the foreigner of his
rights and do not respect me, says Yahweh Sabaoth.

Mai 3:6 “No; I, Yahweh, do not change; and you have not ceased to be children of Jacob!

Mai 3:7 Ever since the days of your ancestors, you have evaded my statutes and not observed them. Return to
me and 1 will return to you, says Yahweh Sabaoth. You ask, ‘How are we to return?

Mai 3:8 Can a human being cheat God?’. Yet you try to cheat me! You ask, ‘How do we try to cheat you?’. Over
tithes and contributions.

Mai 3:9 A curse lies on you because you, this whole nation, try to cheat me.

Mai 3:10 Bring the tithes in full to the treasury, so that there is food in my house; put me to the test now like this,
says Yahweh Sabaoth, and see if I do not open the floodgates of heaven for you and pour out an abundant
blessing for you.

Mai 3:11 For your sakes, I shall forbid the locust to destroy the produce of your soil or prevent the vine from
bearing fruit in your field, says Yahweh Sabaoth,

Mai 3:12 and all the nations will call you blessed, for you will be a land of delights, says Yahweh Sabaoth.

Mai 3:13 “You have said harsh things about me, says Yahweh. And yet you say, ‘What have we said against
you?’.

Mai 3:14 You have said, ‘It is useless to serve God; what is the good of keeping his commands or of walking
mournfully before Yahweh Sabaoth?

Mai 3:15 In fact, we now call the proud the happy ones; the evil-doers are the ones who prosper; they put God
to the test, yet come to no harm!’”.

Mai 3:16 Then those who feared Yahweh talked to one another about this, and Yahweh took note and listened;
and a book of remembrance was written in his presence recording those who feared him and kept his name in
mind.

Mai 3:17 “On the day when 1 act, says Yahweh Sabaoth, they will be my most prized possession, and 1 shall
spare them in the way a man spares the son who serves him.

Mai 3:18 Then once again you will see the difference between the upright person and the wicked one, between
the one who serves God and the one who does not serve him.

Mai 3:19 “For look, the Day is coming, glowing like a furnace. All the proud and all the evil-doers will be the
stubble, and the Day, when it comes, will set them ablaze, says Yahweh Sabaoth, leaving them neither root nor
branch.

Mai 3:20 But for you who fear my name, the Sun of justice will rise with healing in his rays, and you will come
out leaping like calves from the stall,

Mai 3:21 and trample on the wicked, who will be like ashes under the soles of your feet on the day when I act,
says Yahweh Sabaoth.

Mai 3:22 “Remember the Law of my servant Moses to whom at Horeb I prescribed decrees and rulings for all
Israel.

Mai 3:23 “Look, I shall send you the prophet Elijah before the great and awesome Day of Yahweh comes.

Mai 3:24 He will reconcile parents to their children and children to their parents, to forestall my putting the
country under the curse of destruction”.
