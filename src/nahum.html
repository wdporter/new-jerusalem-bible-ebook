<h2 id="ii">The  Fall of Nineveh (2:2–3:19)</h2>

<h4>The assault (2:2–11)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The destroyer has advanced on you,</span><br />
	<span>guarding the siege-works, watching the road,</span><br />
	<span>bracing himself, mustering great strength!</span><br />
	<span>(For Yahweh has restored the vine of Jacob,</span><br />
	<span>yes, the vine of Israel,</span><br />
	<span>although the plunderers had plundered them,</span><br />
	<span>although they had snapped off their vine-shoots!)</span><br />
	<span>The shields of his fighting men show red,</span><br />
	<span>his warriors are dressed in scarlet;</span><br />
	<span>the metal of the chariots sparkles</span><br />
	<span>as he prepares for battle;</span><br />
	<span>the horsemen are impatient for action;</span><br />
	<span>the chariots storm through the streets,</span><br />
	<span>jostling one another in the squares;</span><br />
	<span>they look like blazing flames,</span><br />
	<span>like lightning they dash to and fro.</span><br />
	<span>His captains are called out;</span><br />
	<span>stumbling as they go,</span><br />
	<span>they speed towards the wall,</span><br />
	<span>and the mantelet is put in position.</span><br />
	<span>The sluices of the River are opened,</span><br />
	<span>and the palace melts in terror.</span><br />
	<span>Beauty is taken captive, carried away,</span><br />
	<span>her slave-girls moaning like doves</span><br />
	<span>and beating their breasts.</span><br />
	<span>Nineveh is like a lake,</span><br />
	<span>whose waters are draining away.</span><br />
	<span>“Stop! Stop!”.</span><br />
	<span>But no one turns back.</span><br />
	<span>“Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold!”.</span><br />
	<span>There is no end to the treasure,</span><br />
	<span>a mass of everything you could desire!</span><br />
	<span>Ravaged, wrecked, ruined!</span><br />
	<span>Heart fails and knees give way,</span><br />
	<span>anguish is in the loins of all,</span><br />
	<span>and every face grows pale!</span>
</p>

<h4>Sentence passed on the lion of Assyria (2:12–14)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Where is the lions’ den now,</span><br />
	<span>the cave of the lion’s whelps,</span><br />
	<span>where the lion and lioness walked with their cubs</span><br />
	<span>and no one molested them,</span><br />
	<span>where the lion would tear up food for his whelps</span><br />
	<span>and strangle the kill for his mates,</span><br />
	<span>where he filled his caverns with prey</span><br />
	<span>and his lairs with spoil?</span><br />
	<span>Look, I am against you! — declares Yahweh Sabaoth —</span><br />
	<span>I shall send your chariots up in smoke,</span><br />
	<span>and the sword will devour your whelps;</span><br />
	<span>I shall cut short your depredations on earth,</span><br />
	<span>and the voices of your envoys will be heard no more.</span>
</p>

<h4>Sentence passed on Nineveh the harlot (3:1–7)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Disaster to the city of blood,</span><br />
	<span>packed throughout with lies,</span><br />
	<span>stuffed with booty,</span><br />
	<span>where plundering has no end!</span><br />
	<span>The crack of the whip!</span><br />
	<span>The rumble of wheels!</span><br />
	<span>Galloping horse,</span><br />
	<span>jolting chariot,</span><br />
	<span>charging cavalry,</span><br />
	<span>flashing swords,</span><br />
	<span>gleaming spears,</span><br />
	<span>a mass of wounded,</span><br />
	<span>hosts of dead,</span><br />
	<span>countless corpses;</span><br />
	<span>they stumble over corpses —</span><br />
	<span>because of the countless whorings of the harlot,</span><br />
	<span>the graceful beauty, the cunning witch,</span><br />
	<span>who enslaved nations by her harlotries</span><br />
	<span>and tribes by her spells.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Look, I am against you! — declares Yahweh Sabaoth —</span><br />
	<span>I shall lift your skirts as high as your face</span><br />
	<span>and show your nakedness to the nations,</span><br />
	<span>your shame to the kingdoms.</span><br />
	<span>I shall pelt you with filth,</span><br />
	<span>I shall shame you and put you in the pillory.</span><br />
	<span>Then all who look at you</span><br />
	<span>will shrink from you and say,</span><br />
	<span>“Nineveh has been ruined!”.</span><br />
	<span>Who will mourn for her?</span><br />
	<span>Where would I find people to comfort you?</span>
</p>

<h4>The lesson of Thebes (3:8–11)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Are you better off than No-Amon</span><br />
	<span>situated among rivers,</span><br />
	<span>her defences the seas,</span><br />
	<span>her rampart the waters?</span><br />
	<span>In Ethiopia and Egypt</span><br />
	<span>lay her strength, and it was boundless;</span><br />
	<span>Put and the Libyans served in her army.</span><br />
	<span>But she too went into exile,</span><br />
	<span>into captivity;</span><br />
	<span>her little ones too were dashed to pieces</span><br />
	<span>at every crossroad;</span><br />
	<span>lots were drawn for her nobles,</span><br />
	<span>all her great men were put in chains.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>You too will become drunk,</span><br />
	<span>you will go into hiding;</span><br />
	<span>you too will have to search</span><br />
	<span>for a refuge from the enemy.</span>
</p>

<h4>Nineveh’s preparations useless (3:12–15a)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Your fortifications are all fig trees,</span><br />
	<span>with early ripening figs:</span><br />
	<span>as soon as they are shaken,</span><br />
	<span>they fall into the mouth of the eater.</span><br />
	<span>Look at your people:</span><br />
	<span>you are a nation of women!</span><br />
	<span>The gates of your country</span><br />
	<span>gape open to your enemies;</span><br />
	<span>fire has devoured their bars!</span><br />
	<span>Draw yourselves water for the siege,</span><br />
	<span>strengthen your fortifications!</span><br />
	<span>Into the mud with you, puddle the clay,</span><br />
	<span>repair the brick-kiln!</span><br />
	<span>There the fire will burn you up,</span><br />
	<span>the sword will cut you down.</span>
</p>

<h4>The locusts fly away (3:15b–17a)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Make yourselves as numerous as locusts,</span><br />
	<span>make yourselves as numerous as the hoppers,</span><br />
	<span>let your commercial agents</span><br />
	<span>outnumber the stars of heaven,</span><br />
	<span>your garrisons, like locusts,</span><br />
	<span>and your marshals, like swarms of hoppers!</span><br />
	<span>They settle on the walls</span><br />
	<span>when the day is cold.</span><br />
	<span>The sun appears,</span><br />
	<span>the locusts spread their wings, they fly away,</span><br />
	<span>away they fly, no one knows where.</span>
</p> 

<h4>A funeral lament (3:17b–19)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Alas, your shepherds are asleep,</span><br />
	<span>king of Assyria,</span><br />
	<span>your bravest men slumber;</span><br />
	<span>your people are scattered on the mountains</span><br />
	<span>with no one to gather them.</span><br />
	<span>There is no remedy for your wound,</span><br />
	<span>your injury is past healing.</span><br />
	<span>All who hear the news of you</span><br />
	<span>clap their hands at your downfall.</span><br />
	<span>For who has not felt</span><br />
	<span>your unrelenting cruelty?</span>
</p>
