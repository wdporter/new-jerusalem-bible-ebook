<h4>The two paths</h4>

<p class="poem">
<span>How blessed is anyone who rejects the advice of the wicked</span><br />
<span>and does not take a stand in the path that sinners tread,</span><br />
<span>nor a seat in company with cynics,</span><br />
<span>but who delights in the law of Yahweh</span><br />
<span>and murmurs his law day and night.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>Such a one is like a tree planted near streams;</span><br />
<span>it bears fruit in season and its leaves never wither,</span><br />
<span>and every project succeeds.</span><br />
<span>How different the wicked, how different!</span><br />
</p> 

<p class="poem">
<span>Just like chaff blown around by the wind</span><br />
<span>the wicked will not stand firm at the Judgement</span><br />
<span>nor sinners in the gathering of the upright.</span><br />
<span>For Yahweh watches over the path of the upright,</span><br />
<span>but the path of the wicked is doomed.</span><br />
</p>


<h2 id="p2">Psalm 2</h2>

<h4>The messianic drama</h4>

<p class="poem">
<span>Why this uproar among the nations,</span><br />
<span>this impotent muttering of the peoples?</span><br />
<span>Kings of the earth take up position,</span><br />
<span>princes plot together</span><br />
<span>against Yahweh and his anointed,</span><br />
<span>“Now let us break their fetters!</span><br />
<span>Now let us throw off their bonds!”.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>He who is enthroned in the heavens laughs,</span><br />
<span>Yahweh makes a mockery of them,</span><br />
<span>then in his anger rebukes them,</span><br />
<span>in his rage he strikes them with terror.</span><br />
<span>“I myself have anointed my king</span><br />
<span>on Zion my holy mountain”.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>I will proclaim the decree of Yahweh:</span><br />
<span>He said to me, “You are my son,</span><br />
<span>today have I fathered you.</span><br />
<span>Ask of me, and I shall give you the nations as your birthright,</span><br />
<span>the whole wide world as your possession.</span><br />
<span>With an iron sceptre you will break them,</span><br />
<span>shatter them like so many pots”.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>So now, you kings, come to your senses,</span><br />
<span>you earthly rulers, learn your lesson!</span><br />
<span>In fear be submissive to Yahweh;</span><br />
<span>with trembling kiss his feet,</span><br />
<span>lest he be angry and your way come to nothing,</span><br />
<span>for his fury flares up in a moment.</span><br />
</p> 

<p class="poem">
<span>How blessed are all who take refuge in him!</span><br />
</p>


<h2 id="p3">Psalm 3</h2>

<span>Yahweh, how countless are my enemies,</span><br />
<span>how countless those who rise up against me,</span><br />
<span>how countless those who say of me,</span><br />
<span>“No salvation for him from his God!”.<span class="pause">Pause</span></span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>But you, Yahweh, the shield at my side,</span><br />
<span>my glory, you hold my head high.</span><br />
<span>I cry out to Yahweh;</span><br />
<span>he answers from his holy mountain.<span class="pause">Pause</span></span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>As for me, if I lie down and sleep,</span><br />
<span>I shall awake, for Yahweh sustains me.</span><br />
<span>I have no fear of people in their thousands upon thousands,</span><br />
<span>who range themselves against me wherever I turn.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>Arise, Yahweh, rescue me, my God!</span><br />
<span>You strike all my foes across the face,</span><br />
<span>you break the teeth of the wicked.</span><br />
<span>In Yahweh is salvation,</span><br />
<span>on your people, your blessing!<span class="pause">Pause</span></span><br />

<span>Psalm</span>
<span>OfDavid</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>When I call, answer me, God, upholder of my right.</span><br />
<span>In my distress you have set me at large;</span><br />
<span>take pity on me and hear my prayer!</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>Children of men, how long will you be heavy of heart,</span><br />
<span>why love what is vain and chase after illusions?<span class="pause">Pause</span></span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>Realise that Yahweh performs wonders for his faithful,</span><br />
<span>Yahweh listens when I call to him.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>Be careful not to sin,</span><br />
<span>speak in your hearts, and on your beds keep silence.<span class="pause">Pause</span></span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>Loyally offer sacrifices, and trust in Yahweh.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>Many keep saying, “Who will put happiness before our eyes?”.</span><br />
<span>Let the light of your face shine on us.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>Yahweh, to my heart you are a richer joy</span><br />
<span>than all their corn and new wine.</span><br />

<p class="poem">
<span>In peace I lie down and at once fall asleep,</span><br />
<span>for it is you and none other, Yahweh, who make me rest secure.</span><br />

<span class="i1">spare a thought for my sighing.</span><br />
<span>Listen to my cry for help,</span><br />
<span class="i1"> my King and my God!</span><br />
</p> 

<p class="poem">
<span>To you I pray, Yahweh.</span><br />
<span class="i1">At daybreak you hear my voice;</span><br />
<span>at daybreak I lay my case before you</span><br />
<span class="i1">and fix my eyes on you.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>You are not a God who takes pleasure in evil,</span><br />
<span class="i1">no sinner can be your guest.</span><br />
<span>Boasters cannot stand their ground</span><br />
<span class="i1">under your gaze.</span><br />
</p> 

<p class="poem">
<span>You hate evil-doers,</span><br />

<p class="poem">
<span>Not a word from their lips can be trusted,</span><br />
<span class="i1">through and through they are destruction,</span><br />
<span>their throats are wide — open graves,</span><br />
<span class="i1">their tongues seductive.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>Lay the guilt on them, God,</span><br />
<span class="i1">make their intrigues their own downfall;</span><br />
<span>for their countless offences, thrust them from you,</span><br />
<span class="i1">since they have rebelled against you.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>But joy for all who take refuge in you,</span><br />

<span>Psalm</span>

<span>Yahweh, let your rebuke to me not be in anger,</span><br />

<span>Have pity on me, Yahweh, for I am fading away.</span><br />
<span>Heal me, Yahweh, my bones are shaken,</span><br />
<span>my spirit is shaken to its very depths.</span><br />
<span>But you, Yahweh … how long?</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>Yahweh, relent and save my life</span><br />

<span>for in death there is no remembrance of you;</span><br />
<span>who could sing your praises in Sheol?</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>I am worn out with groaning,</span><br />
<span>every night I drench my pillow</span><br />
<span>and soak my bed with tears.</span><br />
<span>My eyes waste away with vexation.</span><br />
<span>Arrogance from all my foes!</span><br />
<span>Away from me, all evil-doers!</span><br />

<p class="poem">
<span>For Yahweh has heard the sound of my weeping,</span><br />
<span>Yahweh has heard my pleading.</span><br />

</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>Yahweh my God, if I have done this:</span><br />

<span>look at him: pregnant with malice,</span><br />

<span>He digs a trap, scoops it out,</span><br />

<p class="poem">
<span>God, we have heard for ourselves,</span><br />
<span>our ancestors have told us,</span><br />
<span>of the deeds you did in their days,</span><br />
<span>in days of old, by your hand.</span>
</p> 

<p class="poem">
<span>To establish them in the land you drove out nations,</span><br />
<span>to make room for them you harried peoples.</span><br />
<span>It was not their own sword that won the land,</span><br />
<span>nor their own arms which made them victorious,</span><br />
<span>but your hand it was and your arm,</span><br />
<span>and the light of your presence, for you loved them.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>You are my king, my God,</span><br />
<span>who decreed Jacob’s victories;</span><br />
<span>through you we conquered our opponents,</span><br />
<span>in your name we trampled down those who rose up against us.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>For my trust was not in my bow,</span><br />
<span>my victory was not won by my sword;</span><br />
<span>it was you who saved us from our opponents,</span><br />
<span>you who put to shame those who hate us.</span><br />
<span>Our boast was always of God,</span><br />
<span>we praised your name without ceasing. <span class="pause">Pause</span></span>
</p> 

<p class="poem">
<span>Yet now you have abandoned and humiliated us,</span><br />
<span>you no longer take the field with our armies,</span><br />
<span>you leave us to fall back before the enemy,</span><br />
<span>those who hate us plunder us at will.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>You hand us over like sheep for slaughter,</span><br />
<span>you scatter us among the nations,</span><br />
<span>you sell your people for a trifle</span><br />
<span>and make no profit on the sale.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>You make us the butt of our neighbours,</span><br />
<span>the mockery and scorn of those around us,</span><br />
<span>you make us a by-word among nations,</span><br />
<span>other peoples shake their heads over us.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>All day long I brood on my disgrace,</span><br />
<span>the shame written clear on my face,</span><br />
<span>from the sound of insult and abuse,</span><br />
<span>from the sight of hatred and vengefulness.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>All this has befallen us though we had not forgotten you,</span><br />
<span>nor been disloyal to your covenant,</span><br />
<span>our hearts never turning away,</span><br />
<span>our feet never straying from your path.</span><br />
<span>Yet you have crushed us in the place where jackals live,</span><br />
<span>and immersed us in shadow dark as death.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>Had we forgotten the name of our God</span><br />

<span>would not God have found this out,</span><br />
<span>for he knows the secrets of the heart?</span><br />
<span>For your sake we are being massacred all day long,</span><br />
<span>treated as sheep to be slaughtered.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>Wake, Lord! Why are you asleep?</span><br />
<span>Awake! Do not abandon us for good.</span><br />
<span>Why do you turn your face away,</span><br />
<span>forgetting that we are poor and harassed?</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>For we are bowed down to the dust,</span><br />
<span>and lie prone on the ground.</span><br />
<span>Arise! Come to our help!</span><br />
<span>Ransom us, as your faithful love demands.</span><br />

Psa 50:1 [Psalm Of Asaph] The God of gods, Yahweh, is speaking, from east to west he summons the earth.
Psa 50:2 From Zion, perfection of beauty, he shines forth;

Psa 50:3 he is coming, our God, and will not be silent. Devouring fire ahead of him, raging tempest around him,
Psa 50:4 he summons the heavens from on high, and the earth to judge his people.

Psa 50:5 “Gather to me my faithful, who sealed my covenant by sacrifice”.

Psa 50:6 The heavens proclaim his saving justice, “God himself is judge. “Pause

Psa 50:7 “Listen, my people, I am speaking, Israel, I am giving evidence against you, I, God, your God.

Psa 50:8 “It is not with your sacrifices that I find fault, those burnt offerings constantly before me;

Psa 50:9 I will not accept any bull from your homes, nor a single goat from your folds.

Psa 50:10 “For all forest creatures are mine already, the animals on the mountains in their thousands.

Psa 50:1 1 I know every bird in the air, whatever moves in the fields is mine.

Psa 50:12 “If I am hungry I shall not tell you, since the world and all it holds is mine.

Psa 50:13 Am I to eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats?

Psa 50:14 “Let thanksgiving be your sacrifice to God, fulfil the vows you make to the Most High;

Psa 50:15 then if you call to me in time of trouble I will rescue you and you will honour me”.

Psa 50:16 But to the wicked, God says: “What right have you to recite my statutes, to take my covenant on your
lips,

Psa 50:17 when you detest my teaching, and thrust my words behind you?

Psa 50:18 “You make friends with a thief as soon as you see one, you feel at home with adulterers,

Psa 50:19 your conversation is devoted to wickedness, and your tongue to inventing lies.

Psa 50:20 “You sit there, slandering your own brother, you malign your own mother’s son.

Psa 50:21 You do this, and am I to say nothing? Do you think that I am really like you? I charge you, indict you
to your face.

Psa 50:22 “Think it out, you who forget God, or I will tear you apart without hope of a rescuer.

Psa 50:23 Honour to me is a sacrifice of thanksgiving; to the upright I will show God’s salvation”.

<hr />
Psa 74:1 [Poem Of Asaph] God, why have you finally rejected us, your anger blazing against the flock you used
to pasture?

Psa 74:2 Remember the people you took to yourself long ago, your own tribe which you redeemed, and this
Mount Zion where you came to live.

Psa 74:3 Come up to these endless ruins! The enemy have sacked everything in the sanctuary;

Psa 74:4 your opponents made uproar in the place of assemblies, they fixed their emblems over the entrance,
emblems

Psa 74:5 never known before. Their axes deep in the wood,

Psa 74:6 hacking at the panels, they battered them down with axe and pick;

Psa 74:7 they set fire to your sanctuary, profanely razed to the ground the dwelling-place of your name.

Psa 74:8 They said to themselves, “Let us crush them at one stroke!”. They burned down every sacred shrine in
the land.

Psa 74:9 We see no signs, no prophet any more, and none of us knows how long it will last.

Psa 74:10 How much longer, God, will the enemy blaspheme? Is the enemy to insult your name for ever?

Psa 74:1 1 Why hold back your hand, keep your right hand hidden in the folds of your robe?

Psa 74:12 Yet, God, my king from the first, author of saving acts throughout the earth,

Psa 74: 1 3 by your power you split the sea in two, and smashed the heads of the monsters on the waters.

Psa 74:14 You crushed Leviathan’s heads, gave him as food to the wild animals.

Psa 74:15 You released the springs and brooks, and turned primordial rivers into dry land.

Psa 74:16 Yours is the day and yours the night, you caused sun and light to exist,

Psa 74:17 you fixed all the boundaries of the earth, you created summer and winter.

Psa 74:18 Remember, Yahweh, the enemy’s blasphemy, a foolish people insults your name.

Psa 74:19 Do not surrender your turtledove to the beast; do not forget for ever the life of your oppressed people.
Psa 74:20 Look to the covenant! All the hiding-places of the land are full, haunts of violence.

Psa 74:21 Do not let the downtrodden retreat in confusion, give the poor and needy cause to praise your name.
Psa 74:22 Arise, God, champion your own cause, remember how fools blaspheme you all day long!

Psa 74:23 Do not forget the shouting of your enemies, the ever-mounting uproar of your adversaries.

Psa 75:1 [For the choirmaster Tune: “Do not destroy” Psalm Of Asaph Song] We give thanks to you, God, we
give thanks to you, as we call upon your name, as we recount your wonders.

Psa 75:2 “At the appointed time I myself shall dispense justice.

Psa 75:3 The earth quakes and all its inhabitants; it is I who hold its pillars firm. Pause
Psa 75:4 “I said to the boastful, ‘Do not boast!’. to the wicked, ‘Do not flaunt your strength!

Psa 75:5 Do not flaunt your strength so proudly, do not talk with that arrogant stance’”.

Psa 75:6 No longer from east to west, no longer in the mountainous desert,

Psa 75:7 is God judging in uprightness, bringing some down, raising others.



Psa 75:8 Yahweh is holding a cup filled with a heady blend of wine; he will pour it, they will drink it to the dregs,
all the wicked on earth will drink it.

Psa 75:9 But I shall speak out for ever, shall make music for the God of Jacob.

Psa 75:10 I shall break down all the strength of the wicked, and the strength of the upright will rise high.

Psa 76:1 [For the choirmaster For strings Psalm Of Asaph Song] God is acknowledged in Judah, his name is
great in Israel,

Psa 76:2 his tent is pitched in Salem, his dwelling is in Zion;

Psa 76:3 there he has broken the lightning-flashes of the bow, shield and sword and war.Pause
Psa 76:4 Radiant you are, and renowned for the mountains of booty

Psa 76:5 taken from them. Heroes are now sleeping their last sleep, the warriors’ arms have failed them;

Psa 76:6 at your reproof, God of Jacob, chariot and horse stand stunned.

Psa 76:7 You, you alone, strike terror! Who can hold his ground in your presence when your anger strikes?

Psa 76:8 From heaven your verdicts thunder, the earth is silent with dread

Psa 76:9 when God takes his stand to give judgement, to save all the humble of the earth. Pause

Psa 76:10 Human anger serves only to praise you, the survivors of your anger will huddle round you.

Psa 76:1 1 Make and fulfil your vows to Yahweh your God, let those who surround him make offerings to the
Awesome One.

Psa 76:12 He cuts short the breath of princes, strikes terror in earthly kings.

Psa 77:1 [For the choirmaster … Jeduthun Of Asaph Psalm] I cry to God in distress, I cry to God and he hears
me.

Psa 77:2 In the day of my distress I sought the Lord; all night I tirelessly stretched out my hands, my heart
refused to be consoled.

Psa 77:3 I sigh as I think of God, my spirit faints away as I ponder on him. Pause
Psa 77:4 You kept me from closing my eyes, I was too distraught to speak;

Psa 77:5 I thought of former times, years long past

Psa 77:6 I recalled; through the night I ponder in my heart, as I reflect, my spirit asks this question:

Psa 77:7 Is the Lord’s rejection final? Will he never show favour again?

Psa 77:8 Is his faithful love gone for ever? Has his Word come to an end for all time?

Psa 77:9 Does God forget to show mercy? In anger does he shut off his tenderness?Pause

Psa 77:10 And I said, “This is what wounds me, the right hand of the Most High has lost its strength”.

Psa 77:1 1 Remembering Yahweh’s great deeds, remembering your wonders in the past,

Psa 77:12 I reflect on all that you did, I ponder all your great deeds.

Psa 77:13 God, your ways are holy! What god is as great as our God?

Psa 77:14 You are the God who does marvellous deeds, brought nations to acknowledge your power,

Psa 77:15 with your own arm redeeming your people, the children of Jacob and Joseph. Pause

Psa 77:16 When the waters saw you, God, when the waters saw you they writhed in anguish, the very depths

shook with fear.

Psa 77:17 The clouds pelted down water, the sky thundered, your arrows shot back and forth.

Psa 77:18 The rolling of your thunder was heard, your lightning-flashes lit up the world, the earth shuddered and
shook.

Psa 77:19 Your way led over the sea, your path over the countless waters, and none could trace your footsteps.
Psa 77:20 You guided your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

Psa 79:1 [Psalm Of Asaph] God, the pagans have invaded your heritage, they have defiled your holy temple,
they have laid Jerusalem in ruins,

Psa 79:2 they have left the corpses of your servants as food for the birds of the air, the bodies of your faithful for
the wild beasts.

Psa 79:3 Around Jerusalem they have shed blood like water, leaving no one to bury them.

Psa 79:4 We are the scorn of our neighbours, the butt and laughing-stock of those around us.

Psa 79:5 How long will you be angry, Yahweh? For ever? Is your jealousy to go on smouldering like a fire?

Psa 79:6 Pour out your anger on the nations who do not acknowledge you, and on the kingdoms that do not call
on your name;

Psa 79:7 for they have devoured Jacob and devastated his home.

Psa 79:8 Do not count against us the guilt of former generations, in your tenderness come quickly to meet us,
for we are utterly weakened;

Psa 79:9 help us, God our Saviour, for the glory of your name; Yahweh, wipe away our sins, rescue us for the
sake of your name.

Psa 79:10 Why should the nations ask, “Where is their God?”. Let us see the nations suffer vengeance for
shedding your servants’ blood.

Psa 79:1 1 May the groans of the captive reach you, by your great strength save those who are condemned to
death!

Psa 79:12 Repay our neighbours sevenfold for the insults they have levelled at you, Lord.

Psa 79:13 And we, your people, the flock that you pasture, will thank you for ever, will recite your praises from
age to age.

Psa 80:1 [For the choirmaster Tune: “The decrees are lilies’ Of Asaph Psalm] Shepherd of Israel, listen, you who

lead Joseph like a flock, enthroned on the winged creatures, shine forth

Psa 80:2 over Ephraim, Benjamin and Manasseh; rouse your valour and come to our help.

Psa 80:3 God, bring us back, let your face shine on us and we shall be safe.

Psa 80:4 Yahweh, God Sabaoth, how long will you flare up at your people’s prayer?

Psa 80:5 You have made tears their food, redoubled tears their drink.

Psa 80:6 You let our neighbours quarrel over us, our enemies mock us.

Psa 80:7 God Sabaoth, bring us back, let your face shine on us and we shall be safe.

Psa 80:8 You brought a vine out of Egypt, to plant it you drove out nations;

Psa 80:9 you cleared a space for it, it took root and filled the whole country.

Psa 80:10 The mountains were covered with its shade, and the cedars of God with its branches,

Psa 80:1 1 its boughs stretched as far as the sea, its shoots as far as the River.

Psa 80:12 Why have you broken down its fences? Every passer-by plucks its grapes,

Psa 80:13 boars from the forest tear at it, wild beasts feed on it.

Psa 80:14 God Sabaoth, come back, we pray, look down from heaven and see, visit this vine;

Psa 80:15 protect what your own hand has planted.

Psa 80:16 They have thrown it on the fire like dung, the frown of your rebuke will destroy them.

Psa 80:17 May your hand protect those at your side, the child of Adam you have strengthened for yourself!

Psa 80:18 Never again will we turn away from you, give us life and we will call upon your name.

Psa 80:19 God Sabaoth, bring us back, let your face shine on us and we shall be safe.

Psa 81:1 [For the choirmaster On the … of Gath Of Asaph] Sing for joy to God our strength, shout in triumph to
the God of Jacob.

Psa 81 :2 Strike up the music, beat the tambourine, play the melodious harp and the lyre;

Psa 81 :3 blow the trumpet for the new month, for the full moon, for our feast day!

Psa 81 :4 For Israel has this statute, a decision of the God of Jacob,

Psa 81 :5 a decree he imposed on Joseph, when he went to war against Egypt. I heard a voice unknown to me,
Psa 81 :6 “I freed his shoulder from the burden, his hands were able to lay aside the labourer’s basket.

Psa 81:7 You cried out in your distress, so I rescued you. “Hidden in the storm, I answered you, I tested you at
the waters of Meribah. Pause

Psa 81 :8 Listen, my people, while I give you warning; Israel, if only you would listen to me!



Psa 81 :9 “You shall have no strange gods, shall worship no alien god.

Psa 81:10 I, Yahweh, am your God, who brought you here from Egypt, you have only to open your mouth for
me to fill it.

Psa 81:11 “My people would not listen to me, Israel would have none of me.

Psa 81:12 So I left them to their stubborn selves, to follow their own devices.

Psa 81:13 “If only my people would listen to me, if only Israel would walk in my ways,

Psa 81:14 at one stroke I would subdue their enemies, turn my hand against their opponents.

Psa 81:15 “Those who hate Yahweh would woo his favour, though their doom was sealed for ever,

Psa 81:16 while I would feed him on pure wheat, would give you your fill of honey from the rock”.

Psa 82:1 [Psalm Of Asaph] God takes his stand in the divine assembly, surrounded by the gods he gives
judgement.

Psa 82:2 “How much longer will you give unjust judgements and uphold the prestige of the wicked?

Psa 82:3 Let the weak and the orphan have justice, be fair to the wretched and the destitute. Pause
Psa 82:4 “Rescue the weak and the needy, save them from the clutches of the wicked.

Psa 82:5 “Ignorant and uncomprehending, they wander in darkness, while the foundations of the world are
tottering.

Psa 82:6 I had thought, ‘Are you gods, are all of you sons of the Most High?’.

Psa 82:7 No! you will die as human beings do, as one man, princes, you will fall”.

Psa 82:8 Arise, God, judge the world, for all nations belong to you.

Psa 92:1 [Psalm Song For the Sabbath] It is good to give thanks to Yahweh, to make music for your name, Most
High,

Psa 92:2 to proclaim your faithful love at daybreak, and your constancy all through the night,

Psa 92:3 on the lyre, the ten-stringed lyre, to the murmur of the harp.

Psa 92:4 You have brought me joy, Yahweh, by your deeds, at the work of your hands I cry out,

Psa 92:5 “How great are your works, Yahweh, immensely deep your thoughts!”.

Psa 92:6 Stupid people cannot realise this, fools do not grasp it.

Psa 92:7 The wicked may sprout like weeds, and every evil-doer flourish, but only to be eternally destroyed;

Psa 92:8 whereäs you are supreme for ever, Yahweh.

Psa 92:9 Look how your enemies perish, how all evil-doers are scattered!

Psa 92:10 You give me the strength of the wild ox, you anoint me with fresh oil;

Psa 92:1 1 I caught sight of the ambush against me, overheard the plans of the wicked.

Psa 92:12 The upright will flourish like the palm tree, will grow like a cedar of Lebanon.

Psa 92:13 Planted in the house of Yahweh, they will flourish in the courts of our God.

Psa 92:14 In old age they will still bear fruit, will remain fresh and green,

Psa 92:15 to proclaim Yahweh’s integrity; my rock, in whom no fault can be found.

Psa 93:1 Yahweh is king, robed in majesty, robed is Yahweh and girded with power.

Psa 93:2 The world is indeed set firm, it can never be shaken; your throne is set firm from of old, from all
eternity you exist.

Psa 93:3 The rivers lift up, Yahweh, the rivers lift up their voices, the rivers lift up their thunder.

Psa 93:4 Greater than the voice of many waters, more majestic than the breakers of the sea, Yahweh is
majestic in the heights.

Psa 93:5 Your decrees stand firm, unshakeable, holiness is the beauty of your house, Yahweh, for all time to
come.



Psa 94:1 God of vengeance, Yahweh, God of vengeance, shine forth!

Psa 94:2 Arise, judge of the world, give back the proud what they deserve!

Psa 94:3 How long are the wicked, Yahweh, how long are the wicked to triumph?

Psa 94:4 They bluster and boast, they flaunt themselves, all the evil-doers.

Psa 94:5 They crush your people, Yahweh, they oppress your heritage,

Psa 94:6 they murder the widow and the stranger, bring the orphan to a violent death.

Psa 94:7 They say, “Yahweh is not looking, the God of Jacob is taking no notice”.

Psa 94:8 Take notice yourselves, you coarsest of people! Fools, when will you learn some sense?

Psa 94:9 Shall he who implanted the ear not hear, he who fashioned the eye not see?

Psa 94:10 Shall he who instructs nations not punish? Yahweh, the teacher of all people,

Psa 94:1 1 knows human plans and how insipid they are.

Psa 94:12 How blessed are those you instruct, Yahweh, whom you teach by means of your law,

Psa 94:13 to give them respite in evil times, till a pit is dug for the wicked.

Psa 94:14 Yahweh will not abandon his people, he will not desert his heritage;

Psa 94: 1 5 for judgement will again become saving justice, and in its wake all upright hearts will follow.

Psa 94:16 Who rises up on my side against the wicked? Who stands firm on my side against all evil-doers?

Psa 94: 1 7 If Yahweh did not come to my help, I should soon find myself dwelling in the silence.

Psa 94:18 I need only say, “I am slipping”, for your faithful love, Yahweh, to support me;

Psa 94: 1 9 however great the anxiety of my heart, your consolations soothe me.

Psa 94:20 Are you partner to a destructive court, that gives disorder the status of law?

Psa 94:21 They make an attack on the life of the upright, and condemn innocent blood.

Psa 94:22 No! Yahweh is a stronghold to me, my God is my rock of refuge.

Psa 94:23 He turns back their guilt on themselves, annihilates them for their wickedness, he annihilates them,
Yahweh our God.

Psa 95:1 Come, let us cry out with joy to Yahweh, acclaim the rock of our salvation.

Psa 95:2 Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving, acclaim him with music.

Psa 95:3 For Yahweh is a great God, a king greater than all the gods.

Psa 95:4 In his power are the depths of the earth, the peaks of the mountains are his;

Psa 95:5 the sea belongs to him, for he made it, and the dry land, moulded by his hands.

Psa 95:6 Come, let us bow low and do reverence; kneel before Yahweh who made us!

Psa 95:7 For he is our God, and we the people of his sheepfold, the flock of his hand. If only you would listen to
him today!

Psa 95:8 Do not harden your hearts as at Meribah, as at the time of Massah in the desert,

Psa 95:9 when your ancestors challenged me, put me to the test, and saw what I could do!

Psa 95:10 For forty years that generation sickened me, and I said, “Always fickle hearts; they cannot grasp my
ways”.

Psa 95:1 1 Then in my anger I swore they would never enter my place of rest.

Psa 96:1 Sing a new song to Yahweh! Sing to Yahweh, all the earth!

Psa 96:2 Sing to Yahweh, bless his name! Proclaim his salvation day after day,

Psa 96:3 declare his glory among the nations, his marvels to every people!

Psa 96:4 Great is Yahweh, worthy of all praise, more awesome than any of the gods.

Psa 96:5 All the gods of the nations are idols! It was Yahweh who made the heavens;

Psa 96:6 in his presence are splendour and majesty, in his sanctuary power and beauty.

Psa 96:7 Give to Yahweh, families of nations, give to Yahweh glory and power,

Psa 96:8 give to Yahweh the glory due to his name! Bring an offering and enter his courts,

Psa 96:9 adore Yahweh in the splendour of his holiness. Tremble before him, all the earth.

Psa 96:10 Say among the nations, “Yahweh is king”. The world is set firm, it cannot be moved. He will judge the
nations with justice.

Psa 96:1 1 Let the heavens rejoice and earth be glad! Let the sea thunder, and all it holds!

Psa 96:12 Let the countryside exult, and all that is in it, and all the trees of the forest cry out for joy,

Psa 96:13 at Yahweh’s approach, for he is coming, coming to judge the earth; he will judge the world with
saving justice, and the nations with constancy.

Psa 97:1 Yahweh is king! Let earth rejoice, the many isles be glad!

Psa 97:2 Cloud, black cloud enfolds him, saving justice and judgement the foundations of his throne.

Psa 97:3 Fire goes before him, sets ablaze his enemies all around;

Psa 97:4 his lightning-flashes light up the world, the earth sees it and quakes.

Psa 97:5 The mountains melt like wax, before the Lord of all the earth.

Psa 97:6 The heavens proclaim his saving justice, all nations see his glory.

Psa 97:7 Shame on all who serve images, who pride themselves on their idols; bow down to him, all you gods!



Psa 97:8 Zion hears and is glad, the daughters of Judah exult, because of your judgements, Yahweh.

Psa 97:9 For you are Yahweh, Most High over all the earth, far transcending all gods.

Psa 97:10 Yahweh loves those who hate evil, he keeps safe his faithful, rescues them from the clutches of the
wicked.

Psa 97:1 1 Light dawns for the upright, and joy for honest hearts.

Psa 97:12 Rejoice in Yahweh, you who are upright, praise his unforgettable holiness.

Psa 98:1 [Psalm] Sing a new song to Yahweh, for he has performed wonders, his saving power is in his right
hand and his holy arm.

Psa 98:2 Yahweh has made known his saving power, revealed his saving justice for the nations to see,

Psa 98:3 mindful of his faithful love and his constancy to the House of Israel. The whole wide world has seen
the saving power of our God.

Psa 98:4 Acclaim Yahweh, all the earth, burst into shouts of joy!

Psa 98:5 Play to Yahweh on the harp, to the sound of instruments;

Psa 98:6 to the sound of trumpet and horn, acclaim the presence of the King.

Psa 98:7 Let the sea thunder, and all that it holds, the world and all who live in it.

Psa 98:8 Let the rivers clap their hands, and the mountains shout for joy together,

Psa 98:9 at Yahweh’s approach, for he is coming to judge the earth; he will judge the world with saving justice
and the nations with fairness.

Psa 99:1 Yahweh is king, the peoples tremble; he is enthroned on the winged creatures, the earth shivers;

Psa 99:2 Yahweh is great in Zion. He is supreme over all nations;

Psa 99:3 let them praise your name, great and awesome; holy is he

Psa 99:4 and mighty! You are a king who loves justice, you established honesty, justice and uprightness; in
Jacob it is you who are active.

Psa 99:5 Exalt Yahweh our God, bow down at his footstool; holy is he!

Psa 99:6 Moses and Aaron are among his priests, and Samuel, calling on his name; they called on Yahweh and
he answered them.

Psa 99:7 He spoke with them in the pillar of fire, they obeyed his decrees, the Law he gave them.

Psa 99:8 Yahweh our God, you answered them, you were a God of forgiveness to them, but punished them for
their sins.

Psa 99:9 Exalt Yahweh our God, bow down at his holy mountain; holy is Yahweh our God!

Psa 100:1 [Psalm For thanksgiving] Acclaim Yahweh, all the earth,

Psa 100:2 serve Yahweh with gladness, come into his presence with songs of joy!

Psa 100:3 Be sure that Yahweh is God, he made us, we belong to him, his people, the flock of his sheepfold.
Psa 100:4 Come within his gates giving thanks, to his courts singing praise, give thanks to him and bless his
name!

Psa 1 00:5 For Yahweh is good, his faithful love is everlasting, his constancy from age to age.

Psa 102:1 [Prayer of someöne afflicted, who in misfortune pours out sorrows before Yahweh] Yahweh, hear my
prayer, let my cry for help reach you.

Psa 102:2 Do not turn away your face from me when I am in trouble; bend down and listen to me, when I call,
be quick to answer me!

Psa 102:3 For my days are vanishing like smoke, my bones burning like an oven;

Psa 102:4 like grass struck by blight, my heart is withering, I forget to eat my meals.

Psa 1 02:5 From the effort of voicing my groans my bones stick out through my skin.

Psa 102:6 I am like a desert-owl in the wastes, a screech-owl among ruins,

Psa 102:7 I keep vigil and moan like a lone bird on a roof.



Psa 102:8 All day long my enemies taunt me, those who once praised me now use me as a curse.

Psa 102:9 Ashes are the food that I eat, my drink is mingled with tears,

Psa 102:10 because of your fury and anger, since you have raised me up only to cast me away;

Psa 102:11 my days are like a fading shadow, I am withering up like grass.

Psa 102:12 But you, Yahweh, are enthroned for ever, each generation in turn remembers you.

Psa 102:13 Rise up, take pity on Zion! the time has come to have mercy on her, the moment has come;

Psa 102:14 for your servants love her very stones, are moved to pity by her dust.

Psa 102:15 Then will the nations revere the name of Yahweh, and all the kings of the earth your glory;

Psa 102:16 when Yahweh builds Zion anew, he will be seen in his glory;

Psa 102:17 he will turn to hear the prayer of the destitute, and will not treat their prayer with scorn.

Psa 102:18 This shall be put on record for a future generation, and a people yet to be born shall praise God:

Psa 102:19 Yahweh has leaned down from the heights of his sanctuary, has looked down from heaven to earth,
Psa 1 02:20 to listen to the sighing of the captive, and set free those condemned to death,

Psa 102:21 to proclaim the name of Yahweh in Zion, his praise in Jerusalem;

Psa 102:22 nations will gather together, and kingdoms to worship Yahweh.

Psa 102:23 In my journeying my strength has failed on the way;

Psa 102:24 let me know the short time I have left. Do not take me away before half my days are done, for your
years run on from age to age.

Psa 102:25 Long ago you laid earth’s foundations, the heavens are the work of your hands.

Psa 102:26 They pass away but you remain; they all wear out like a garment, like outworn clothes you change
them;

Psa 1 02:27 but you never alter, and your years never end.

Psa 1 02:28 The children of those who serve you will dwell secure, and their descendants live on in your
presence.

<hr />
Psa 105:1 Alleluia! Give thanks to Yahweh, call on his name, proclaim his deeds to the peoples!

Psa 105:2 Sing to him, make music for him, recount all his wonders!

Psa 105:3 Glory in his holy name, let the hearts that seek Yahweh rejoice!

Psa 105:4 Seek Yahweh and his strength, tirelessly seek his presence!

Psa 1 05:5 Remember the marvels he has done, his wonders, the judgements he has spoken.

Psa 105:6 Stock of Abraham, his servant, children of Jacob whom he chose!

Psa 105:7 He is Yahweh our God, his judgements touch the whole world.

Psa 105:8 He remembers his covenant for ever, the promise he laid down for a thousand generations,

Psa 105:9 which he concluded with Abraham, the oath he swore to Isaac.

Psa 105:10 He established it as a statute for Jacob, an everlasting covenant with Israel,

Psa 105:11 saying, To you I give a land, Canaan, your allotted birthright”.

Psa 105:12 When they were insignificant in numbers, a handful of strangers in the land,

Psa 105:13 wandering from country to country, from one kingdom and nation to another,

Psa 105:14 he allowed no one to oppress them; for their sake he instructed kings,

Psa 105:15 “Do not touch my anointed ones, to my prophets you may do no harm”.

Psa 105:16 He called down famine on the land, he took away theirfood supply;

Psa 105:17 he sent a man ahead of them, Joseph, sold as a slave.

Psa 105:18 So his feet were weighed down with shackles, his neck was put in irons.

Psa 105:19 In due time his prophecy was fulfilled, the word of Yahweh proved him true.

Psa 1 05:20 The king sent orders to release him, the ruler of nations set him free;

Psa 1 05:21 he put him in charge of his household, the ruler of all he possessed,

Psa 105:22 to instruct his princes as he saw fit, to teach his counsellors wisdom.

Psa 105:23 Then Israel migrated to Egypt, Jacob settled in the country of Ham.

Psa 105:24 He made his people increase in numbers, he gave them more strength than their enemies,

Psa 105:25 whose heart he turned to hate his own people, to double-cross his servants.

Psa 105:26 He sent his servant Moses, and Aaron, the man of his choice.

Psa 105:27 They worked there the wonders he commanded, marvels in the country of Ham.

Psa 105:28 Darkness he sent, and darkness fell, but that nation defied his orders.

Psa 105:29 He turned their rivers to blood, and killed all the fish in them.

Psa 105:30 Their country was overrun with frogs, even in the royal apartments;

Psa 105:31 at his word came flies, and mosquitoes throughout the country.



Psa 105:32 He gave them hail as their rain, flames of fire in their land;

Psa 1 05:33 he blasted their vine and their fig tree, and shattered the trees of the country.

Psa 105:34 At his word came locusts, hoppers beyond all counting;

Psa 105:35 they devoured every green thing in the land, devoured all the produce of the soil.

Psa 1 05:36 He struck all the first-born in their land, the flower of all their manhood;

Psa 1 05:37 he led Israel out with silver and gold; in their tribes there was none who stumbled.

Psa 1 05:38 Egypt was glad at their leaving, for terror of Israel had seized them.

Psa 105:39 He spread out a cloud to cover them, and fire to light up the night.

Psa 105:40 They asked and he brought them quails, food from heaven to their hearts’ content;

Psa 105:41 he opened a rock, the waters gushed out, and flowed in dry ground as a river.

Psa 105:42 Faithful to his sacred promise, given to his servant Abraham,

Psa 105:43 he led out his people with rejoicing, his chosen ones with shouts of joy.

Psa 105:44 He gave them the territories of nations, they reaped the fruit of other people’s labours,

Psa 105:45 on condition that they kept his statutes, and remained obedient to his laws.

Psa 106:1 Alleluia! Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, his faithful love is everlasting!

Psa 106:2 Who can recount all Yahweh’s triumphs, who can fully voice his praise?

Psa 1 06:3 How blessed are those who keep to what is just, whose conduct is always upright!

Psa 1 06:4 Remember me, Yahweh, in your love for your people. Come near to me with your saving power,

Psa 1 06:5 let me share the happiness of your chosen ones, let me share the joy of your people, the pride of
your heritage.

Psa 106:6 Like our ancestors, we have sinned, we have acted wickedly, guiltily;

Psa 1 06:7 our ancestors in Egypt never grasped the meaning of your wonders. They did not bear in mind your
countless acts of love, at the Sea of Reeds they defied the Most High;

Psa 1 06:8 but for the sake of his name he saved them, to make known his mighty power.

Psa 106:9 At his rebuke the Sea of Reeds dried up, he let them pass through the deep as though it were desert,
Psa 106:10 so he saved them from their opponents’ clutches, rescued them from the clutches of their enemies.
Psa 106:11 The waters enveloped their enemies, not one of whom was left.

Psa 106:12 Then they believed what he had said, and sang his praises.

Psa 106:13 But they soon forgot his achievements, they did not even wait for his plans;

Psa 106:14 they were overwhelmed with greed in the wastelands, in the solitary wastes they challenged God.
Psa 106:15 He gave them all they asked for, but struck them with a deep wasting sickness;

Psa 106:16 in the camp they grew jealous of Moses, and of Aaron, Yahweh’s holy one.

Psa 106:17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, closed in on Abiram’s faction;

Psa 106:18 fire flamed out against their faction, the renegades were engulfed in flames.

Psa 106:19 At Horeb they made a calf, bowed low before cast metal;

Psa 1 06:20 they exchanged their glory for the image of a grass-eating bull.

Psa 1 06:21 They forgot the God who was saving them, who had done great deeds in Egypt,

Psa 106:22 such wonders in the land of Ham, such awesome deeds at the Sea of Reeds.

Psa 106:23 He thought of putting an end to them, had not Moses, his chosen one, taken a stand in the breach
and confronted him, to turn his anger away from destroying them.

Psa 106:24 They counted a desirable land for nothing, they put no trust in his promise;

Psa 1 06:25 they stayed in their tents and grumbled, they would not listen to Yahweh’s voice.

Psa 106:26 So he lifted his hand against them, to strike them down in the desert,

Psa 106:27 to strike down their descendants among the nations, to scatter them all over the world.

Psa 106:28 They committed themselves to serve Baal-Peor, and ate sacrifices made to lifeless gods.

Psa 106:29 They so provoked him by their actions that a plague broke out among them.

Psa 106:30 Then up stood Phinehas to intervene, and the plague was checked;

Psa 1 06:31 for this he is the example of uprightness, from age to age for ever.

Psa 106:32 At the waters of Meribah they so angered Yahweh, that Moses suffered on their account,

Psa 106:33 for they had embittered his spirit, and he spoke without due thought.

Psa 106:34 They did not destroy the nations, as Yahweh had told them to do,

Psa 106:35 but intermarried with them, and adopted their ways.

Psa 106:36 They worshipped those nations’ false gods, till they found themselves entrapped,

Psa 106:37 and sacrificed their own sons and their daughters to demons.

Psa 1 06:38 Innocent blood they shed, the blood of their sons and daughters; offering them to the idols of
Canaan, they polluted the country with blood.

Psa 1 06:39 They defiled themselves by such actions, their behaviour was that of a harlot.

Psa 106:40 Yahweh’s anger blazed out at his people, his own heritage filled him with disgust.

Psa 1 06:41 He handed them over to the nations, and their opponents became their masters;



Psa 1 06:42 their enemies lorded it over them, crushing them under their rule.

Psa 1 06:43 Time and again he rescued them, but they still defied him deliberately, and sank ever deeper in their
guilt;

Psa 106:44 even so he took pity on their distress, as soon as he heard them cry out.

Psa 106:45 Bearing his covenant with them in mind, he relented in his boundless and faithful love;

Psa 1 06:46 he ensured that they received compassion, in their treatment by all their captors.

Psa 106:47 Save us, Yahweh our God, gather us from among the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy
name, and may glory in praising you.

Psa 106:48 Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, from all eternity and for ever! Let all the people say, “Amen 1 .
Psa 107:1 Alleluia! Give thanks to Yahweh for he is good, his faithful love lasts for ever.

Psa 107:2 So let them say whom Yahweh redeemed, whom he redeemed from the power of their enemies,

Psa 107:3 bringing them back from foreign lands, from east and west, north and south.

Psa 107:4 They were wandering in the desert, in the wastelands, could find no way to an inhabited city;

Psa 107:5 they were hungry and thirsty, their life was ebbing away.

Psa 107:6 They cried out to Yahweh in their distress, he rescued them from their plight,

Psa 107:7 he set them on the road, straight to an inhabited city.

Psa 107:8 Let them thank Yahweh for his faithful love, for his wonders for the children of Adam!

Psa 107:9 He has fed the hungry to their hearts’ content, filled the starving with good things.

Psa 107:10 Sojourners in gloom and shadow dark as death, fettered in misery and chains,

Psa 107:11 for defying the orders of Yahweh, for scorning the plan of the Most High-
Psa 107:12 he subdued their spirit by hard labour; if they fell there was no one to help.

Psa 107:13 They cried out to Yahweh in their distress, he rescued them from their plight,

Psa 107:14 he brought them out from gloom and shadow dark as death, and shattered their chains.

Psa 107:15 Let them thank Yahweh for his faithful love, for his wonders for the children of Adam!

Psa 107:16 He broke open gates of bronze and smashed iron bars.

Psa 107:17 Fools for their rebellious ways, wretched because of their sins,

Psa 107:18 finding all food repugnant, brought close to the gates of death-

Psa 107:19 they cried out to Yahweh in their distress; he rescued them from their plight,

Psa 107:20 he sent out his word and cured them, and rescued their life from the abyss.

Psa 107:21 Let them thank Yahweh for his faithful love, for his wonders for the children of Adam!

Psa 107:22 Let them offer thanksgiving sacrifices, and recount with shouts of joy what he has done!

Psa 107:23 Voyagers on the sea in ships, plying their trade on the great ocean,

Psa 107:24 have seen the works of Yahweh, his wonders in the deep.

Psa 107:25 By his word he raised a storm-wind, lashing up towering waves.

Psa 107:26 Up to the sky then down to the depths! Their stomachs were turned to water;

Psa 107:27 they staggered and reeled like drunkards, and all their skill went under.

Psa 107:28 They cried out to Yahweh in their distress, he rescued them from their plight,

Psa 107:29 he reduced the storm to a calm, and all the waters subsided,

Psa 107:30 and he brought them, overjoyed at the stillness, to the port where they were bound.

Psa 107:31 Let them thank Yahweh for his faithful love, for his wonders for the children of Adam!

Psa 107:32 Let them extol him in the assembly of the people, and praise him in the council of elders.

Psa 107:33 He has turned rivers into desert, bubbling springs into arid ground,

Psa 107:34 fertile country into salt-flats, because the people living there were evil.

Psa 107:35 But he has turned desert into stretches of water, arid ground into bubbling springs,

Psa 107:36 and has given the hungry a home, where they have built themselves a city.

Psa 107:37 There they sow fields and plant vines, and reap a harvest of their produce.

Psa 107:38 He blesses them and their numbers increase, he keeps their cattle at full strength.

Psa 107:39 Their numbers had fallen, they had grown weak, under pressure of disaster and hardship;

Psa 107:40 he covered princes in contempt, left them to wander in trackless wastes.

Psa 107:41 But the needy he raises from their misery, makes their families as numerous as sheep.

Psa 107:42 At the sight the honest rejoice, and the wicked have nothing to say.

Psa 107:43 Who is wise? Such a one should take this to heart, and come to understand Yahweh’s faithful love.

Psa 1 16:1 Alleluia! I am filled with love when Yahweh listens to the sound of my prayer,

Psa 1 16:2 when he bends down to hear me, as I call.

Psa 1 16:3 The bonds of death were all round me, the snares of Sheol held me fast; distress and anguish held
me in their grip,

Psa 1 16:4 I called on the name of Yahweh. Deliver me, Yahweh, I beg you.

Psa 116:5 Yahweh is merciful and upright, our God is tenderness.

Psa 1 16:6 Yahweh looks after the simple, when I was brought low he gave me strength.

Psa 1 16:7 My heart, be at peace once again, for Yahweh has treated you generously.

Psa 1 16:8 He has rescued me from death, my eyes from tears, and my feet from stumbling.



Psa 116:9 I shall pass my life in the presence of Yahweh, in the land of the living.

Psa 1 16:10 My trust does not fail even when I say, “I am completely wretched”.

Psa 1 16:1 1 In my terror I said, “No human being can be relied on”.

Psa 1 16:12 What return can I make to Yahweh for his generosity to me?

Psa 116:13 I shall take up the cup of salvation and call on the name of Yahweh.

Psa 1 16:14 I shall fulfil my vows to Yahweh, witnessed by all his people.

Psa 1 16:15 Costly in Yahweh’s sight is the death of his faithful.

Psa 1 16:16 I beg you, Yahweh! I am your servant, I am your servant and my mother was your servant; you have
undone my fetters.

Psa 116:17 I shall offer you a sacrifice of thanksgiving and call on the name of Yahweh.

Psa 116:18 I shall fulfil my vows to Yahweh, witnessed by all his people,

Psa 1 16:19 in the courts of the house of Yahweh, in your very heart, Jerusalem.

Psa 117:1 Alleluia! Praise Yahweh, all nations, extol him, all peoples,

Psa 117:2 for his faithful love is strong and his constancy never-ending.

Psa 1 18:1 Alleluia! Give thanks to Yahweh for he is good, for his faithful love endures for ever.

Psa 1 1 8:3 Let the House of Aaron say, “His faithful love endures for ever”.

Psa 1 1 8:4 Let those who fear Yahweh say, “His faithful love endures for ever”.

Psa 118:5 In my distress I called to Yahweh, he heard me and brought me relief.

Psa 118:6 With Yahweh on my side I fear nothing; what can human beings do to me?

Psa 1 1 8:7 With Yahweh on my side as my help, I gloat over my enemies.

Psa 1 1 8:8 It is better to take refuge in Yahweh than to rely on human beings;

Psa 1 18:9 better to take refuge in Yahweh than to rely on princes.

Psa 1 18:10 Nations were swarming around me, in the name of Yahweh I cut them down;

Psa 1 18:1 1 they swarmed around me, pressing upon me, in the name of Yahweh I cut them down.

Psa 1 18:12 They swarmed around me like bees, they flared up like a brushwood fire, in the name of Yahweh I
cut them down.

Psa 1 18:13 I was pushed hard, to make me fall, but Yahweh came to my help.

Psa 1 18:14 Yahweh is my strength and my song, he has been my Saviour.

Psa 118:15 Shouts of joy and salvation, in the tents of the upright, “Yahweh’s right hand is triumphant,

Psa 118:16 Yahweh’s right hand is victorious, Yahweh’s right hand is triumphant!”.

Psa 1 18:17 I shall not die, I shall live to recount the great deeds of Yahweh.

Psa 1 18:18 Though Yahweh punished me sternly, he has not abandoned me to death.

Psa 1 18:19 Open for me the gates of saving justice, I shall go in and thank Yahweh.

Psa 1 1 8:20 This is the gate of Yahweh, where the upright go in.

Psa 1 1 8:21 I thank you for hearing me, and making yourself my Saviour.

Psa 1 18:22 The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone;

Psa 1 1 8:23 This is Yahweh’s doing, and we marvel at it.

Psa 1 1 8:24 This is the day which Yahweh has made, a day for us to rejoice and be glad.

Psa 118:25 We beg you, Yahweh, save us, we beg you, Yahweh, give us victory!

Psa 1 1 8:26 Blessed in the name of Yahweh is he who is coming! We bless you from the house of Yahweh.

Psa 118:27 Yahweh is God, he gives us light. Link your processions, branches in hand, up to the horns of the
altar.

Psa 1 1 8:28 You are my God, I thank you, all praise to you, my God. I thank you for hearing me, and making
yourself my Saviour.

Psa 1 1 8:29 Give thanks to Yahweh for he is good, for his faithful love endures for ever.

Psa 119:1 How blessed are those whose way is blameless, who walk in the Law of Yahweh!

Psa 119:2 Blessed are those who observe his instructions, who seek him with all their hearts,

Psa 1 1 9:3 and, doing no evil, who walk in his ways.

Psa 1 19:4 You lay down your precepts to be carefully kept.

Psa 1 1 9:5 May my ways be steady in doing your will.

Psa 119:6 Then I shall not be shamed, if my gaze is fixed on your commandments.

Psa 119:7 I thank you with a sincere heart for teaching me your upright judgements.

Psa 119:8 I shall do your will; do not ever abandon me wholly.

Psa 1 1 9:9 How can a young man keep his way spotless? By keeping your words.

Psa 1 19:10 With all my heart I seek you, do not let me stray from your commandments.

Psa 1 19:1 1 In my heart I treasure your promises, to avoid sinning against you.

Psa 1 19:12 Blessed are you, Yahweh, teach me your will!

Psa 1 19:13 With my lips I have repeated all the judgements you have given.

In the way of your instructions lies my joy, a joy beyond all wealth.

I will ponder your precepts and fix my gaze on your paths.

I find my delight in your will, I do not forget your words.

Be generous to your servant and I shall live, and shall keep your words.

Open my eyes and I shall fix my gaze on the wonders of your Law.

Wayfarer though I am on the earth, do not hide your commandments from me.

My heart is pining away with longing at all times for your judgements.

You have rebuked the arrogant, the accursed, who stray from your commandments.

Set me free from taunts and contempt since I observe your instructions.

Though princes sit plotting against me, your servant keeps pondering your will.

Your instructions are my delight, your wishes my counsellors.

Down in the dust I lie prostrate; true to your word, revive me.

I tell you my ways and you answer me; teach me your wishes.

Show me the way of your precepts, that I may reflect on your wonders.

I am melting away for grief; true to your word, raise me up.

Keep me far from the way of deceit, grant me the grace of your Law.

I have chosen the way of constancy, I have moulded myself to your judgements.

I cling to your instructions, Yahweh, do not disappoint me.

I run the way of your commandments, for you have given me freedom of heart.

Teach me, Yahweh, the way of your will, and I will observe it.

Give me understanding and I will observe your Law, and keep it wholeheartedly.

Guide me in the way of your commandments, for my delight is there.

Bend my heart to your instructions, not to selfish gain.

Avert my eyes from pointless images, by your word give me life.

Keep your promise to your servant so that all may hold you in awe.

Avert the taunts that I dread, for your judgements are generous.

See how I yearn for your precepts; in your saving justice give me life.

Let your faithful love come to me, Yahweh, true to your promise, save me!

Give me an answer to the taunts against me, since I rely on your word.

Do not deprive me of that faithful word, since my hope lies in your judgements.

I shall keep your Law without fail for ever and ever.

I shall live in all freedom because I have sought your precepts.

I shall speak of your instructions before kings and will not be shamed.

Your commandments fill me with delight, I love them dearly.

I stretch out my hands to your commandments that I love, and I ponder your judgements.
Keep in mind your promise to your servant on which I have built my hope.

It is my comfort in distress, that your promise gives me life.

Endlessly the arrogant have jeered at me, but I have not swerved from your Law.

I have kept your age — old judgements in mind, Yahweh, and I am comforted.

Fury grips me when I see the wicked who abandon your Law.

Your judgements are my song where I live in exile.

All night, Yahweh, I hold your name in mind, I keep your Law.

This is what it means to me, observing your precepts.

My task, I have said, Yahweh, is to keep your word.

Wholeheartedly I entreat your favour; true to your promise, take pity on me!

I have reflected on my ways, and I turn my steps to your instructions.

I hurry without delay to keep your commandments.

Though caught in the snares of the wicked, I do not forget your Law.

At midnight I rise to praise you for your upright judgements.

I am a friend to all who fear you and keep your precepts.

Your faithful love fills the earth, Yahweh, teach me your judgements.

You have been generous to your servant, Yahweh, true to your promise.

Teach me judgement and knowledge, for I rely on your commandments.

Before I was punished I used to go astray, but now I keep to your promise.

You are generous and act generously, teach me your will.

The arrogant blacken me with lies though I wholeheartedly observe your precepts.

Their hearts are gross like rich fat, but my delight is in your Law.

It was good for me that I had to suffer, the better to learn your judgements.

The Law you have uttered is more precious to me than all the wealth in the world.



Psa 1 1 9:73 Your hands have made me and held me firm, give me understanding and I shall learn your
commandments.

Psa 1 1 9:74 Those who fear you rejoice at the sight of me since I put my hope in your word.

Psa 1 1 9:75 I know, Yahweh, that your judgements are upright, and in punishing me you show your constancy.
Psa 1 1 9:76 Your faithful love must be my consolation, as you have promised your servant.

Psa 1 1 9:77 T reat me with tenderness and I shall live, for your Law is my delight.

Psa 1 1 9:78 Let the arrogant who tell lies against me be shamed, while I ponder your precepts.

Psa 1 1 9:79 Let those who fear you rally to me, those who understand your instructions.

Psa 1 1 9:80 My heart shall be faultless towards your will; then I shall not be ashamed.

Psa 1 1 9:81 I shall wear myself out for your salvation, for your word is my hope.

Psa 1 1 9:82 My eyes, too, are worn out waiting for your promise, when will you have pity on me?

Psa 1 1 9:83 For I am like a smoked wineskin, but I do not forget your will.

Psa 1 1 9:84 How long has your servant to live? When will you bring my persecutors to judgement?

Psa 1 1 9:85 The arrogant have dug pitfalls for me in defiance of your Law.

Psa 119:86 All your commandments show constancy. Help me when they pursue me dishonestly.

Psa 1 1 9:87 They have almost annihilated me on earth, but I have not deserted your precepts.

Psa 119:88 True to your faithful love, give me life, and I shall keep the instructions you have laid down.

Psa 119:89 Forever, Yahweh, your word is planted firm in heaven.

Psa 1 1 9:90 Your constancy endures from age to age; you established the earth and it stands firm.

Psa 1 1 9:91 Through your judgements all stands firm to this day, for all creation is your servant.

Psa 119:92 Had your Law not been my delight, I would have perished in my misery.

Psa 1 1 9:93 I shall never forget your precepts, for by them you have given me life.

Psa 1 1 9:94 I am yours, save me, for I seek your precepts.

Psa 1 1 9:95 The wicked may hope to destroy me, but all my thought is of your instructions.

Psa 1 1 9:96 I have seen that all perfection is finite, but your commandment has no limit.

Psa 1 1 9:97 How I love your Law! I ponder it all day long.

Psa 1 1 9:98 You make me wiser than my enemies by your commandment which is mine for ever.

Psa 1 1 9:99 I am wiser than all my teachers because I ponder your instructions.

Psa 119:100 I have more understanding than the aged because I keep your precepts.

Psa 1 19:101 I restrain my foot from evil paths to keep your word.

Psa 1 19:102 Ido not turn aside from your judgements, because you yourself have instructed me.

Psa 119:103 How pleasant your promise to my palate, sweeter than honey in my mouth!

Psa 119:104 From your precepts I learn wisdom, so I hate all deceptive ways.

Psa 1 19:105 Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path.

Psa 1 19:106 I have sworn — and shall maintain it — to keep your upright judgements.

Psa 1 19:107 I am utterly wretched, Yahweh; true to your promise, give me life.

Psa 119:108 Accept, Yahweh, the tribute from my mouth, and teach me your judgements.

Psa 1 19:109 My life is in your hands perpetually, I do not forget your Law.

Psa 1 19:1 10 The wicked have laid out a snare for me, but I have not strayed from your precepts.

Psa 1 19:1 1 1 Your instructions are my eternal heritage, they are the joy of my heart.

Psa 1 19:1 12 I devote myself to obeying your statutes, their recompense is eternal.

Psa 1 19:1 13 I hate a divided heart, I love your Law.

Psa 1 19:1 14 You are my refuge and shield, I put my hope in your word.

Psa 1 19:1 15 Leave me alone, you wicked, I shall observe the commandments of my God.

Psa 1 19:1 16 True to your word, support me and I shall live; do not disappoint me of my hope.

Psa 1 19:1 17 Uphold me and I shall be saved, my gaze fixed on your will.

Psa 1 19:1 18 You shake off all who stray from your will; deceit fills their horizon.

Psa 1 19:1 19 In your sight all the wicked of the earth are like rust, so I love your instructions.

Psa 1 19:120 My whole body trembles before you, your judgements fill me with fear.

Psa 1 19:121 All my conduct has been just and upright, do not hand me over to my oppressors.

Psa 1 19:122 Guarantee the well-being of your servant, do not let the proud oppress me.

Psa 1 19:123 My eyes are languishing for your salvation and for the saving justice you have promised.

Psa 1 19:124 Show your faithful love to your servant, teach me your judgements.

Psa 1 19:125 Your servant am I; give me understanding and I shall know your instructions.

Psa 1 19:126 It is time to take action, Yahweh, your Law is being broken.

Psa 1 19:127 So I love your commandments more than gold, purest gold.

Psa 119:128 So I rule my life by your precepts, I hate all deceptive paths.

Psa 119:129 Wonderful are your instructions, so I observe them.

Psa 1 19:130 As your word unfolds it gives light, and even the simple understand.



Psa 1 19:131 I open wide my mouth, panting eagerly for your commandments.

Psa 1 19:132 Turn to me, pity me; those who love your name deserve it.

Psa 1 19:133 Keep my steps firm in your promise; that no evil may triumph over me.

Psa 119:134 Rescue me from human oppression, and I will observe your precepts.

Psa 1 19:135 Let your face shine on your servant, teach me your will.

Psa 119:136 My eyes stream with tears because your Law is disregarded.

Psa 119:137 You are upright, Yahweh, and your judgements are honest.

Psa 119:138 You impose uprightness as a witness to yourself, it is constancy itself.

Psa 1 19:139 My zeal is burning me up because my oppressors forget your word.

Psa 1 19:140 Your promise is well tested, your servant holds it dear.

Psa 1 19:141 Puny and despised as I am, I do not forget your precepts.

Psa 1 19:142 Your saving justice is for ever just, and your Law is trustworthy.

Psa 1 19:143 Though anguish and distress grip me your commandments are my delight.

Psa 119:144 Your instructions are upright for ever, give me understanding and I shall live.

Psa 1 19:145 I call with all my heart; answer me, Yahweh, and I will observe your judgements.

Psa 1 19:146 I call to you; save me, and I will keep your instructions.

Psa 1 19:147 I am awake before dawn to cry for help, I put my hope in your word.

Psa 1 19:148 My eyes are awake before each watch of the night, to ponder your promise.

Psa 1 19:149 In your faithful love, Yahweh, listen to my voice, let your judgements give me life.

Psa 119:150 My pursuers are coming closer to their wicked designs, and further from your Law.

Psa 1 19:151 You are close to me, Yahweh, and all your commandments are true.

Psa 1 19:152 Long have I known that your instructions were laid down to last for ever.

Psa 1 19:153 Look at my suffering and rescue me, for I do not forget your Law.

Psa 119:154 Plead my cause and defend me; as you promised, give me life.

Psa 1 19:155 Salvation is far from the wicked, for they do not seek your will.

Psa 1 19:156 Your kindnesses to me are countless, Yahweh; true to your judgements, give me life.

Psa 119:157 Though my enemies and oppressors are countless, I do not turn aside from your instructions.
Psa 119:158 The sight of these renegades appals me; they do not observe your promise.

Psa 119:159 See how I love your precepts; true to your faithful love, give me life.

Psa 1 19:160 Faithfulness is the essence of your word, your upright judgements hold good for ever.

Psa 1 19:161 Though princes hound me unprovoked, what fills me with awe is your word.

Psa 1 19:162 I rejoice in your promise like one who finds a vast treasure.

Psa 1 19:163 Falsehood I hate and detest, my love is for your Law.

Psa 1 19:164 Seven times a day I praise you for your upright judgements.

Psa 1 19:165 Great peace for those who love your Law; no stumbling-blocks for them!

Psa 1 19:166 I am waiting for your salvation, Yahweh, I fulfil your commandments.

Psa 119:167 I observe your instructions, I love them dearly.

Psa 1 19:168 I observe your precepts, your judgements, for all my ways are before you.

Psa 119:169 May my cry approach your presence, Yahweh; by your word give me understanding.

Psa 1 19:170 May my prayer come into your presence, rescue me as you have promised.

Psa 1 19:171 May my lips proclaim your praise, for you teach me your will.

Psa 1 19:172 May my tongue recite your promise, for all your commandments are upright.

Psa 119:173 May your hand be there to help me, since I have chosen your precepts.

Psa 1 19:174 I long for your salvation, Yahweh, your Law is my delight.

Psa 1 19:175 May I live only to praise you, may your judgements be my help.

Psa 1 19:176 I am wandering like a lost sheep, come and look for your servant, for I have not forgotten your
commandments.

Psa 121 :2 My help comes from Yahweh who made heaven and earth.

Psa 121 :3 May he save your foot from stumbling; may he, your guardian, not fall asleep!

Psa 121 :4 You see — he neither sleeps nor slumbers, the guardian of Israel.



Psa 121 :5 Yahweh is your guardian, your shade, Yahweh, at your right hand.

Psa 121 :6 By day the sun will not strike you, nor the moon by night.

Psa 121 :7 Yahweh guards you from all harm Yahweh guards your life,

Psa 121 :8 Yahweh guards your comings and goings, henceforth and for ever.

Psa 137:1 By the rivers of Babylon we sat and wept at the memory of Zion.

Psa 137:2 On the poplars there we had hung up our harps.

Psa 137:3 For there our gaolers had asked us to sing them a song, our captors to make merry, “Sing us one of
the songs of Zion”.

Psa 137:4 How could we sing a song of Yahweh on alien soil?

Psa 137:5 If I forget you, Jerusalem, may my right hand wither!

Psa 137:6 May my tongue remain stuck to my palate if I do not keep you in mind, if I do not count Jerusalem the
greatest of my joys.

Psa 137:7 Remember, Yahweh, to the Edomites’ cost, the day of Jerusalem, how they said, “Down with it! Rase
it to the ground!”.

Psa 137:8 Daughter of Babel, doomed to destruction, a blessing on anyone who treats you as you treated us,
Psa 137:9 a blessing on anyone who seizes your babies and shatters them against a rock!
