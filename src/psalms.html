<h4>The two paths</h4>

<p class="poem">
<span>How blessed is anyone who rejects the advice of the wicked</span><br />
<span>and does not take a stand in the path that sinners tread,</span><br />
<span>nor a seat in company with cynics,</span><br />
<span>but who delights in the law of Yahweh</span><br />
<span>and murmurs his law day and night.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>Such a one is like a tree planted near streams;</span><br />
<span>it bears fruit in season and its leaves never wither,</span><br />
<span>and every project succeeds.</span><br />
<span>How different the wicked, how different!</span>
</p> 

<p class="poem">
<span>Just like chaff blown around by the wind</span><br />
<span>the wicked will not stand firm at the Judgement</span><br />
<span>nor sinners in the gathering of the upright.</span><br />
<span>For Yahweh watches over the path of the upright,</span><br />
<span>but the path of the wicked is doomed.</span>
</p>


<h2 id="p2">Psalm 2</h2>

<h4>The messianic drama</h4>

<p class="poem">
<span>Why this uproar among the nations,</span><br />
<span>this impotent muttering of the peoples?</span><br />
<span>Kings of the earth take up position,</span><br />
<span>princes plot together</span><br />
<span>against Yahweh and his anointed,</span><br />
<span>“Now let us break their fetters!</span><br />
<span>Now let us throw off their bonds!”.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>He who is enthroned in the heavens laughs,</span><br />
<span>Yahweh makes a mockery of them,</span><br />
<span>then in his anger rebukes them,</span><br />
<span>in his rage he strikes them with terror.</span><br />
<span>“I myself have anointed my king</span><br />
<span>on Zion my holy mountain”.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>I will proclaim the decree of Yahweh:</span><br />
<span>He said to me, “You are my son,</span><br />
<span>today have I fathered you.</span><br />
<span>Ask of me, and I shall give you the nations as your birthright,</span><br />
<span>the whole wide world as your possession.</span><br />
<span>With an iron sceptre you will break them,</span><br />
<span>shatter them like so many pots”.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>So now, you kings, come to your senses,</span><br />
<span>you earthly rulers, learn your lesson!</span><br />
<span>In fear be submissive to Yahweh;</span><br />
<span>with trembling kiss his feet,</span><br />
<span>lest he be angry and your way come to nothing,</span><br />
<span>for his fury flares up in a moment.</span>
</p> 

<p class="poem">
<span>How blessed are all who take refuge in him!</span>
</p>

<span>When he was fleeing from his son Absalom</span>
</p> 

<p class="poem">
<span>Yahweh, how countless are my enemies,</span><br />
<span>how countless those who rise up against me,</span><br />
<span>how countless those who say of me,</span><br />
<span>“No salvation for him from his God!”.<span class="pause">Pause</span></span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>But you, Yahweh, the shield at my side,</span><br />

<span>he answers from his holy mountain.<span class="pause">Pause</span></span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>As for me, if I lie down and sleep,</span><br />
<span>I shall awake, for Yahweh sustains me.</span><br />
<span>I have no fear of people in their thousands upon thousands,</span><br />
<span>who range themselves against me wherever I turn.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>Arise, Yahweh, rescue me, my God!</span><br />
<span>You strike all my foes across the face,</span><br />

</p>

<p class="poem">

<span>In my distress you have set me at large;</span><br />
<span>take pity on me and hear my prayer!</span>

<p class="poem">
<span>Children of men, how long will you be heavy of heart,</span><br />

</p>

<span>To establish them in the land you drove out nations,</span><br />
<span>to make room for them you harried peoples.</span><br />
<span>It was not their own sword that won the land,</span><br />

<span>You are my king, my God,</span><br />

</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>For my trust was not in my bow,</span><br />
<span>my victory was not won by my sword;</span><br />
<span>it was you who saved us from our opponents,</span><br />

<span>Our boast was always of God,</span><br />
<span>we praised your name without ceasing. <span class="pause">Pause</span></span>

</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>You hand us over like sheep for slaughter,</span><br />
<span>you scatter us among the nations,</span><br />
<span>you sell your people for a trifle</span><br />
<span>and make no profit on the sale.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>You make us the butt of our neighbours,</span><br />
<span>the mockery and scorn of those around us,</span><br />
<span>you make us a by-word among nations,</span><br />
<span>other peoples shake their heads over us.</span>

<p class="poem">
<span>All day long I brood on my disgrace,</span><br />
<span>the shame written clear on my face,</span><br />

<span>from the sight of hatred and vengefulness.</span>
</p>

<span>All this has befallen us though we had not forgotten you,</span><br />
<span>nor been disloyal to your covenant,</span><br />
<span>our hearts never turning away,</span><br />

<span>would not God have found this out,</span><br />
<span>for he knows the secrets of the heart?</span><br />
<span>For your sake we are being massacred all day long,</span><br />
<span>treated as sheep to be slaughtered.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>Wake, Lord! Why are you asleep?</span><br />
<span>Awake! Do not abandon us for good.</span><br />
<span>Why do you turn your face away,</span><br />
<span>forgetting that we are poor and harassed?</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>For we are bowed down to the dust,</span><br />
<span>and lie prone on the ground.</span><br />
<span>Arise! Come to our help!</span><br />
<span>Ransom us, as your faithful love demands.</span>
