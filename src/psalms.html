<div>
Psa 1:1 How blessed is anyone who rejects the advice of the wicked and does not take a stand in the path that
sinners tread, nor a seat in company with cynics,

Psa 1 :2 but who delights in the law of Yahweh and murmurs his law day and night.

Psa 1 :3 Such a one is like a tree planted near streams; it bears fruit in season and its leaves never wither, and
every project succeeds.

Psa 1 :4 How different the wicked, how different! Just like chaff blown around by the wind

Psa 1 :5 the wicked will not stand firm at the Judgement nor sinners in the gathering of the upright.

Psa 1 :6 For Yahweh watches over the path of the upright, but the path of the wicked is doomed.

Psa 2:1 Why this uproar among the nations, this impotent muttering of the peoples?

Psa 2:2 Kings of the earth take up position, princes plot together against Yahweh and his anointed,

Psa 2:3 “Now let us break their fetters! Now let us throw off their bonds!”.

Psa 2:4 He who is enthroned in the heavens laughs, Yahweh makes a mockery of them,

Psa 2:5 then in his anger rebukes them, in his rage he strikes them with terror.

Psa 2:6 “I myself have anointed my king on Zion my holy mountain”.

Psa 2:7 I will proclaim the decree of Yahweh: He said to me, “You are my son, today have I fathered you.

Psa 2:8 Ask of me, and I shall give you the nations as your birthright, the whole wide world as your possession.
Psa 2:9 With an iron sceptre you will break them, shatter them like so many pots”.

Psa 2:10 So now, you kings, come to your senses, you earthly rulers, learn your lesson!

Psa 2:11 In fear be submissive to Yahweh;

Psa 2:12 with trembling kiss his feet, lest he be angry and your way come to nothing, for his fury flares up in a
moment. How blessed are all who take refuge in him!

Psa 3:1 [Psalm Of David When he was fleeing from his son Absalom] Yahweh, how countless are my enemies,
how countless those who rise up against me,

Psa 3:2 how countless those who say of me, “No salvation for him from his Godl'Pause
Psa 3:3 But you, Yahweh, the shield at my side, my glory, you hold my head high.

Psa 3:4 I cry out to Yahweh; he answers from his holy mountain. Pause

Psa 3:5 As for me, if I lie down and sleep, I shall awake, for Yahweh sustains me.

Psa 3:6 I have no fear of people in their thousands upon thousands, who range themselves against me
wherever I turn.

Psa 3:7 Arise, Yahweh, rescue me, my God! You strike all my foes across the face, you break the teeth of the
wicked.

Psa 3:8 In Yahweh is salvation, on your people, your blessing!Pause

Psa 4:1 [For the choirmaster For strings Psalm Of David] When I call, answer me, God, upholder of my right. In
my distress you have set me at large; take pity on me and hear my prayer!

Psa 4:2 Children of men, how long will you be heavy of heart, why love what is vain and chase after
illusions?Pause

Psa 4:3 Realise that Yahweh performs wonders for his faithful, Yahweh listens when I call to him.

Psa 4:4 Be careful not to sin, speak in your hearts, and on your beds keep silence. Pause



Psa 4:5 Loyally offer sacrifices, and trust in Yahweh.

Psa 4:6 Many keep saying, “Who will put happiness before our eyes?”. Let the light of your face shine on us.
Yahweh,

Psa 4:7 to my heart you are a richer joy than all their corn and new wine.

Psa 4:8 In peace I lie down and at once fall asleep, for it is you and none other, Yahweh, who make me rest
secure.

<h4>Morning prayer</h4>

<p><em>For the choirmaster   For flutes   Psalm   Of David</em></p>

<p>Give ear to my words, Yahweh, <br />
  spare a thought for my sighing. <br />
Listen to my cry for help, <br />
  my King and my God! </p> 

<p>To you I pray, Yahweh. <br />
  At daybreak you hear my voice; <br />
at daybreak I lay my case before you <br />
  and fix my eyes on you. </p>

<p>You are not a God who takes pleasure in evil, <br />
  no sinner can be your guest. <br />
Boasters cannot stand their ground <br />
  under your gaze. </p> 

<p>You hate evil-doers, <br />
  liars you destroy; <br />
the violent and deceitful <br />
  Yahweh detests. </p>

<p>But, so great is your faithful love, <br />
  I may come into your house, <br />
and before your holy temple <br />
  bow down in reverence of you. </p>

<p>In your saving justice, Yahweh, lead me, <br />
  because of those who lie in wait for me; <br />
make your way plain before me. </p>

<p>Not a word from their lips can be trusted, <br />
  through and through they are destruction, <br />
their throats are wide — open graves, <br />
  their tongues seductive. </p>

<p>Lay the guilt on them, God, <br />
  make their intrigues their own downfall; <br />
for their countless offences, thrust them from you, <br />
  since they have rebelled against you. </p>

<p>But joy for all who take refuge in you, <br />
  endless songs of gladness! <br />
You shelter them, they rejoice in you, <br />
  those who love your name. </p>

<p>It is you who bless the upright, Yahweh, <br />
you surround them with favour as with a shield.</p>
<hr />
Psa 6:1 [For the choirmaster For strings For the octachord Psalm Of David] Yahweh, let your rebuke to me not
be in anger, your punishment not in the heat of wrath.

Psa 6:2 Have pity on me, Yahweh, for I am fading away. Heal me, Yahweh, my bones are shaken,

Psa 6:3 my spirit is shaken to its very depths. But you, Yahweh … how long?

Psa 6:4 Yahweh, relent and save my life rescue me because of your faithful love,

Psa 6:5 for in death there is no remembrance of you; who could sing your praises in Sheol?

Psa 6:6 I am worn out with groaning, every night I drench my pillow and soak my bed with tears.

Psa 6:7 My eyes waste away with vexation. Arrogance from all my foes!

Psa 6:8 Away from me, all evil-doers! For Yahweh has heard the sound of my weeping,

Psa 6:9 Yahweh has heard my pleading. Yahweh will accept my prayer.

Psa 6:10 Let all my enemies be put to confusion, shaken to their depths, let them retreat in sudden confusion.

<h2 id="p7">Psalm 7</h2>

<h4>Prayer of the upright in persecution</h4>

<p><em>Lament   Of David   Which he sang to Yahweh about Cush the Benjaminite</em></p>

<p>Yahweh my God, I take refuge in you, <br />
save me from all my pursuers and rescue me,<br />
or he will savage me like a lion, <br />
carry me off with no one to rescue me. </p>

<p>Yahweh my God, if I have done this: <br />
if injustice has stained my hands, <br />
if I have repaid my ally with treachery <br />
or spared one who attacked me unprovoked, <br />
may an enemy hunt me down and catch me, <br />
may he trample my life into the ground and <br />
crush my vital parts into the dust. </p> 

<p class="pause">Pause</p>

<p>Arise, Yahweh, in your anger, <br />
rise up against the arrogance of my foes. <br />
  Awake, my God, <br />
  you demand judgement.<br />
Let the assembly of nations gather round you; <br />
  return above it on high!<br />
(Yahweh judges the nations.) </p> 

<p>Judge me, Yahweh, as my uprightness <br />
  and my integrity deserve. <br />
Put an end to the malice of the wicked, <br />
  make the upright stand firm, <br />
you who discern hearts and minds, <br />
  God the upright. </p>

<p>God is a shield that protects me, <br />
  saving the honest of heart. <br />
God is an upright judge, <br />
  slow to anger, <br />
  but a God at all times threatening <br />
for those who will not repent. </p> 

<p>Let the enemy whet his sword, <br />
draw his bow and make ready; <br />
but he is making ready instruments of death for himself <br />
and tipping his arrows with fire; <br />
look at him: pregnant with malice, <br />
conceiving spite, he gives birth to treachery. </p>

<p>He digs a trap, scoops it out, <br />
but he falls into the snare he made himself. <br />
His spite recoils on his own head, <br />
his brutality falls back on his own skull. </p>

<p>I thank Yahweh for his saving justice. <br />
I sing to the name of the Most High.</p>
<hr />
Psa 8:1 [For the choirmaster On the … of Gath Psalm Of David] Yahweh our Lord, how majestic is your name
throughout the world! Whoëver keeps singing of your majesty higher than the heavens,

Psa 8:2 even through the mouths of children, or of babes in arms, you make him a fortress, firm against your



foes, to subdue the enemy and the rebel.

Psa 8:3 I look up at your heavens, shaped by your fingers, at the moon and the stars you set firm-

Psa 8:4 what are human beings that you spare a thought for them, or the child of Adam that you care for him?

Psa 8:5 Yet you have made him little less than a god, you have crowned him with glory and beauty,

Psa 8:6 made him lord of the works of your hands, put all things under his feet,

Psa 8:7 sheep and cattle, all of them, and even the wild beasts,

Psa 8:8 birds in the sky, fish in the sea, when he makes his way across the ocean.

Psa 8:9 Yahweh our Lord, how majestic your name throughout the world!

Psa 9:1 [For the choirmaster On oboe and harp Psalm Of David] I thank you, Yahweh, with my whole heart, I
recount all your wonders,

Psa 9:2 I rejoice and delight in you, I sing to your name, Most High.

Psa 9:3 My enemies are in retreat, they stumble and perish at your presence,

Psa 9:4 for you have given fair judgement in my favour, seated on your throne as upright judge.

Psa 9:5 You have rebuked the nations, destroyed the wicked, blotted out their name for ever and ever;

Psa 9:6 the enemy is wiped out — mere ruins for ever — you have annihilated their cities, their memory has
perished. See,

Psa 9:7 Yahweh is enthroned for ever, keeping his throne firm for judgement;

Psa 9:8 he will himself judge the world in uprightness, will give a true verdict on the nations.

Psa 9:9 May Yahweh be a stronghold for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble!

Psa 9:10 Those who revere your name can rely on you, you never desert those who seek you, Yahweh.

Psa 9:1 1 Sing to Yahweh who dwells in Zion, tell the nations his mighty deeds,

Psa 9:12 for the avenger of blood does not forget them, he does not ignore the cry of the afflicted.

Psa 9:13 Have pity on me, Yahweh, see my affliction, pull me back from the gates of death,

Psa 9:14 that I may recount all your praises at the gates of the daughter of Zion and rejoice in your salvation.
Psa 9:15 The nations have fallen into the trap they made, their feet caught in the snare they laid.

Psa 9:16 Yahweh has made himself known, given judgement, he has ensnared the wicked in the work of their
own hands. Muted music Pause

Psa 9:17 May the wicked turn away to Sheol, all the nations forgetful of God.

Psa 9:18 For the needy is not forgotten for ever, not for ever does the hope of the poor come to nothing.

Psa 9:19 Arise, Yahweh; human strength shall not prevail. The nations shall stand trial before you.

Psa 9:20 Strike them with terror, Yahweh; the nations shall know that they are no more than human!Pause
Psa 10:1 Why, Yahweh, do you keep so distant, stay hidden in times of trouble?

Psa 10:2 In his pride the wicked hunts down the weak, who is caught in the schemes he devises.

Psa 10:3 The wicked is proud of his inmost desires, by his blasphemies the grasping spurns Yahweh,

Psa 10:4 the wicked in his arrogance does not look very far; There is no God”, is his only thought.

Psa 10:5 In all circumstances his step is assured; your judgements are above his head. His rivals? He scoffs at
them all.

Psa 10:6 He says in his heart, “I shall never be shaken”, free of trouble himself,

Psa 10:7 he wishes it on others. His speech is full of lies and browbeating, under his tongue lurk spite and
wickedness.

Psa 10:8 In the undergrowth he lies in ambush, in his hiding-place he murders the innocent. He watches intently
for the downtrodden,

Psa 10:9 lurking unseen like a lion in his lair, lurking to pounce on the poor; he pounces on him and drags him
off in his net.

Psa 10:10 He keeps watch, crouching down low, the poor wretch falls into his clutches;

Psa 10:11 he says in his heart, “God forgets, he has turned away his face to avoid seeing the end”.

Psa 10:12 Rise, Yahweh! God, raise your hand, do not forget the afflicted!

Psa 10:13 Why should the wicked spurn God, assuring himself you will never follow it up?

Psa 10:14 You have seen for yourself the trouble and vexation, you watch so as to take it in hand. The
oppressed relies on you; you are the only recourse of the orphan.

Psa 10:15 Break the arm of the wicked and evil, seek out wickedness till there is none left to be found.

Psa 10:16 Yahweh is king for ever and ever, the heathen has vanished from his country.

Psa 10:17 Yahweh, you listen to the laments of the poor, you give them courage, you grant them a hearing,

Psa 10:18 to give judgement for the orphaned and exploited, so that earthborn humans may strike terror no
more.

Psa 1 1:1 [For the choirmaster Of David] In Yahweh I have found refuge. How can you say to me, “Bird, flee to
your mountain?

Psa 1 1 :2 “For look, the wicked are drawing their bows, fitting their arrows to the string to shoot honest men from
the shadows.



Psa 11:3 If the foundations fall to ruin, what can the upright do?”.

Psa 1 1 :4 Yahweh in his holy temple! Yahweh, his throne is in heaven; his eyes watch over the world, his gaze
scrutinises the children of Adam.

Psa 1 1 :5 Yahweh examines the upright and the wicked, the lover of violence he detests.

Psa 11:6 He will rain down red-hot coals, fire and sulphur on the wicked, a scorching wind will be their lot.

Psa 1 1 :7 For Yahweh is upright and loves uprightness, the honest will ever see his face.

Psa 12:1 [For the choirmaster On the octachord Psalm Of David] Help, Yahweh! No one loyal is left, the faithful
have vanished from among the children of Adam.

Psa 12:2 Friend tells lies to friend, and, smooth-tongued, speaks from an insincere heart.

Psa 12:3 May Yahweh cut away every smooth lip, every boastful tongue,

Psa 12:4 those who say, “In our tongue lies our strength, our lips are our allies; who can master us?”.

Psa 12:5 “For the poor who are plundered, the needy who groan, now will I act”, says Yahweh, “I will grant
salvation to those who sigh for it”.

Psa 12:6 Yahweh’s promises are promises unalloyed, natural silver which comes from the earth seven times
refined.

Psa 12:7 You, Yahweh, will watch over them, you will protect them from that brood for ever.

Psa 12:8 The wicked will scatter in every direction, as the height of depravity among the children of Adam.

<h4>A confident appeal</h4>

<p><em>For the choirmaster   Psalm   Of David</em></p>

<p>How long, Yahweh, will you forget me? For ever? <br />
How long will you turn away your face from me?<br />
How long must I nurse rebellion in my soul, <br />
sorrow in my heart day and night? <br />
How long is the enemy to domineer over me?<br />
Look down, answer me, Yahweh my God! <br />
Give light to my eyes or I shall fall into the sleep of death. </p>

<p>Or my foe will boast, “I have overpowered him”, <br />
and my enemy have the joy of seeing me stumble. <br />
As for me, I trust in your faithful love, Yahweh. <br />
Let my heart delight in your saving help, <br />
let me sing to Yahweh for his generosity to me, <br />
let me sing to the name of Yahweh the Most High! </p>

<h4>The fate of the godless</h4>

<p><em>For the choirmaster   Of David</em></p>

<p>The fool has said in his heart, <br />
  “There is no God”. <br />
Their deeds are corrupt and vile, <br />
  not one of them does right. </p>

<p>Yahweh looks down from heaven <br />
  at the children of Adam. <br />
To see if a single one is wise, <br />
  a single one seeks God. </p>

<p>All have turned away, <br />
  all alike turned sour, <br />
not one of them does right, <br />
  not a single one.</p>

<p>Are they not aware, all these evil-doers? <br />
  They are devouring my people, <br />
  this is the bread they eat, <br />
  and they never call to Yahweh. </p>

<p>They will be gripped with fear, <br />
  where there is no need for fear, <br />
for God takes the side of the upright; <br />
you may mock the plans of the poor, <br />
  but Yahweh is their refuge. </p>

<p>Who will bring from Zion salvation for Israel? <br />
When Yahweh brings his people home, <br />
what joy for Jacob, what happiness for Israel! </p>
<hr />
Psa 15:1 [Psalm Of David] Yahweh, who can find a home in your tent, who can dwell on your holy mountain?
Psa 15:2 Whoëver lives blamelessly, who acts uprightly, who speaks the truth from the heart,

Psa 15:3 who keeps the tongue under control, who does not wrong a comrade, who casts no discredit on a
neighbour,

Psa 15:4 who looks with scorn on the vile, but honours those who fear Yahweh, who stands by an oath at any
cost,

Psa 15:5 who asks no interest on loans, who takes no bribe to harm the innocent. No one who so acts can ever
be shaken.

Psa 16:1 [In a quiet voice Of David] Protect me, O God, in you is my refuge.

Psa 16:2 To Yahweh I say, “You are my Lord, my happiness is in none

Psa 16:3 of the sacred spirits of the earth”. They only take advantage of all who love them.

Psa 16:4 People flock to their teeming idols. Never shall I pour libations to them! Never take their names on my
lips.

Psa 16:5 My birthright, my cup is Yahweh; you, you alone, hold my lot secure.

Psa 16:6 The measuring-line marks out for me a delightful place, my birthright is all I could wish.

Psa 16:7 I bless Yahweh who is my counsellor, even at night my heart instructs me.

Psa 16:8 I keep Yahweh before me always, for with him at my right hand, nothing can shake me.

Psa 16:9 So my heart rejoices, my soul delights, my body too will rest secure,

Psa 16:10 for you will not abandon me to Sheol, you cannot allow your faithful servant to see the abyss.

Psa 16:1 1 You will teach me the path of life, unbounded joy in your presence, at your right hand delight for ever.
<hr />

<h2 id="p17">Psalm 17</h2>

<h4>The plea of the innocent</h4>

<p><em>Prayer   Of David</em></p>

<p>Listen, Yahweh, to an upright cause, <br />
  pay attention to my cry, <br />
lend an ear to my prayer, <br />
  my lips free from deceit.<br />
From your presence will issue my vindication, <br />
  your eyes fixed on what is right. </p>

<p>You probe my heart, examine me at night, <br />
you test me by fire and find no evil. <br />
I have not sinned with my mouth as most people do. </p> 

<p>I have treasured the word from your lips, <br />
my steps never stray from the paths you lay down, <br />
from your tracks; so my feet never stumble. <br />
I call upon you, God, for you answer me; <br />
turn your ear to me, hear what I say. <br />
Show the evidence of your faithful love, <br />
saviour of those who hope in your strength against attack. </p>

<p>Guard me as the pupil of an eye, <br />
shelter me in the shadow of your wings <br />
from the presence of the wicked who would maltreat me; <br />
deadly enemies are closing in on me. <br />
Engrossed in themselves <br />
they are mouthing arrogant words.<br />
They are advancing against me, now they are closing in, <br />
watching for the chance to hurl me to the ground, <br />
like a lion preparing to pounce, <br />
like a young lion crouching in ambush. </p>

<p>Arise, Yahweh, confront him and bring him down, <br />
with your sword save my life from the wicked, <br />
Yahweh, from mortals, by your hand, <br />
from mortals whose part in life is in this world. </p> 

<p>You fill their bellies from your store, <br />
their children will have all they desire, <br />
and leave their surplus to their children. <br />
But I in my uprightness will see your face, <br />
and when I awake I shall be filled with the vision of you. </p>


<h2 id="p18">Psalm 18</h2>

<h4>A king’s thanksgiving</h4>

<p><em>For the choirmaster   Of David, the servant of Yahweh, who addressed the words of this song to Yahweh when Yahweh had delivered him from all his enemies and from the clutches of Saul. He said: </em></p>

<p>I love you, Yahweh, my strength <br />
(my Saviour, you have saved me from violence). </p>

<p>Yahweh is my rock and my fortress, <br />
my deliverer is my God. <br />
I take refuge in him, my rock, <br />
my shield, my saving strength, <br />
my stronghold, my place of refuge. </p>

<p>I call to Yahweh who is worthy of praise, <br />
and I am saved from my foes.</p>

<p>With Death’s breakers closing in on me, <br />
Belial’s torrents ready to swallow me, <br />
Sheol’s snares every side of me, <br />
Death’s traps lying ahead of me,
</p>

<p>I called to Yahweh in my anguish, <br />
I cried for help to my God; <br />
from his Temple he heard my voice, <br />
my cry came to his ears.</p>

<p>Then the earth quaked and rocked, <br />
the mountains’ foundations shuddered, <br />
they quaked at his blazing anger. <br />
Smoke rose from his nostrils, <br />
from his mouth devouring fire <br />
(coals were kindled at it). </p>

<p>He parted the heavens and came down, <br />
a storm-cloud underneath his feet; <br />
riding one of the winged creatures, he flew, <br />
soaring on the wings of the wind. </p>

<p>His covering he made the darkness, <br />
his pavilion dark waters and dense cloud. <br />
A brightness lit up before him, <br />
hail and blazing fire. </p>

<p>Yahweh thundered from the heavens, <br />
the Most High made his voice heard. <br />
He shot his arrows and scattered them, <br />
he hurled his lightning and routed them. </p>

<p>The very springs of ocean were exposed, <br />
the world’s foundations were laid bare, <br />
at your roaring, Yahweh, <br />
at the blast of breath from your nostrils! </p>

<p>He reached down from on high, snatched me up, <br />
pulled me from the watery depths, <br />
rescued me from my mighty foe, <br />
from my enemies who were stronger than I. </p>

<p>They assailed me on my day of disaster <br />
but Yahweh was there to support me; <br />
he freed me, set me at large, <br />
he rescued me because he loves me. </p>

<p>Yahweh rewards me for my uprightness, <br />
as my hands are pure, so he repays me, <br />
since I have kept the ways of Yahweh, <br />
and not fallen away from my God. </p>

<p>His judgements are all before me, <br />
his statutes I have not put away from me. <br />
I am blameless before him, <br />
I keep myself clear of evil. </p>

<p>So Yahweh repaid me for acting uprightly <br />
because he could see I was pure. <br />
You are faithful to the faithful, <br />
blameless with the blameless, </p>

<p>sincere to the sincere, <br />
but cunning to the crafty, <br />
you save a people that is humble <br />
and humiliate those with haughty looks. </p>

<p>Yahweh, you yourself are my lamp, <br />
my God lights up my darkness; <br />
with you I storm the rampart, <br />
with my God I can scale any wall. </p>

<p>This God, his way is blameless; <br />
the word of Yahweh is refined in the furnace, <br />
for he alone is the shield <br />
of all who take refuge in him. </p>

<p>For who is God but Yahweh, <br />
who is a rock but our God? <br />
This God who girds me with strength, <br />
who makes my way free from blame, </p>

<p>who makes me as swift as a deer <br />
and sets me firmly on the heights, <br />
who trains my hands for battle, <br />
my arms to bend a bow of bronze. </p>

<p>You give me your invincible shield <br />
(your right hand upholds me) <br />
you never cease to listen to me, <br />
you give me the strides of a giant, <br />
give me ankles that never weaken. </p>

<p>I pursue my enemies and overtake them, <br />
not turning back until they are annihilated; <br />
I strike them down and they cannot rise, <br />
they fall, they are under my feet. </p>

<p>You have girded me with strength for the fight, <br />
bent down my assailants beneath me, <br />
made my enemies retreat before me; <br />
and those who hate me I destroy. </p>

<p>They cry out, there is no one to save; <br />
to Yahweh, but no answer comes. <br />
I crumble them like dust before the wind, <br />
trample them like the mud of the streets. </p>

<p>You free me from the quarrels of my people, <br />
you place me at the head of the nations, <br />
a people I did not know are now my servants; </p>

<p>foreigners come wooing my favour, <br />
no sooner do they hear than they obey me; <br />
foreigners grow faint of heart, <br />
they come trembling out of their fastnesses. </p>

<p>Life to Yahweh! Blessed be my rock! <br />
Exalted be the God of my salvation, <br />
the God who gives me vengeance, <br />
and subjects whole peoples to me, </p>

<p>who rescues me from my raging enemies. <br />
You lift me high above those who attack me, <br />
you deliver me from the man of violence. </p>

<p>For this I will praise you, Yahweh, among the nations, <br />
and sing praise to your name. </p>

<p>He saves his king time after time, <br />
displays his faithful love for his anointed, <br />
for David and his heirs for	ever. </p>

Psa 19:1 [For the choirmaster Psalm Of David] The heavens declare the glory of God, the vault of heaven
proclaims his handiwork,

Psa 19:2 day discourses of it to day, night to night hands on the knowledge.

Psa 19:3 No utterance at all, no speech, not a sound to be heard,

Psa 19:4 but from the entire earth the design stands out, this message reaches the whole world. High above, he
pitched a tent for the sun,

Psa 19:5 who comes forth from his pavilion like a bridegroom, delights like a champion in the course to be run.

Psa 1 9:6 Rising on the one horizon he runs his circuit to the other, and nothing can escape his heat.

Psa 19:7 The Law of Yahweh is perfect, refreshment to the soul; the decree of Yahweh is trustworthy, wisdom
for the simple.

Psa 1 9:8 The precepts of Yahweh are honest, joy for the heart; the commandment of Yahweh is pure, light for
the eyes.

Psa 1 9:9 The fear of Yahweh is pure, lasting for ever; the judgements of Yahweh are true, upright, every one,
Psa 19:10 more desirable than gold, even than the finest gold; his words are sweeter than honey, that drips
from the comb.

Psa 19:11 Thus your servant is formed by them; observing them brings great reward.

Psa 19:12 But who can detect his own failings? Wash away my hidden faults.

Psa 19:13 And from pride preserve your servant, never let it be my master. So shall I be above reproach, free
from grave sin.

Psa 19:14 May the words of my mouth always find favour, and the whispering of my heart, in your presence,
Yahweh, my rock, my redeemer.

Psa 20:1 [For the choirmaster Psalm Of David] May Yahweh answer you in time of trouble, may the name of the
God of Jacob protect you!

Psa 20:2 May he send you help from the sanctuary, give you support from Zion!

Psa 20:3 May he remember all your sacrifices and delight in your burnt offerings! Pause
Psa 20:4 May he grant you your heart’s desire and crown all your plans with success!

Psa 20:5 So that with joy we can hail your victory and draw up our ranks in the name of our God. May Yahweh
grant all your petitions.

Psa 20:6 Now I know that Yahweh gives victory to his anointed. He will respond from his holy heavens with
great deeds of victory from his right hand.

Psa 20:7 Some call on chariots, some on horses, but we on the name of Yahweh our God.

Psa 20:8 They will crumple and fall, while we stand upright and firm.

Psa 20:9 Yahweh, save the king, answer us when we call.

Psa 21:1 [For the choirmaster Psalm Of David] Yahweh, the king rejoices in your power; How your saving help
fills him with joy!

Psa 21 :2 You have granted him his heart’s desire, not denied him the prayer of his lips. Pause

Psa 21 :3 For you come to meet him with blessings of prosperity, put a crown of pure gold on his head.

Psa 21 :4 He has asked for life, you have given it him, length of days for ever and ever.

Psa 21 :5 Great his glory through your saving help; you invest him with splendour and majesty.

Psa 21 :6 You confer on him everlasting blessings, you gladden him with the joy of your presence.

Psa 21 :7 For the king puts his trust in Yahweh; the faithful love of the Most High will keep him from falling.

Psa 21 :8 Your hand will reach all your enemies, your right hand all who hate you.



Psa 21 :9 You will hurl them into a blazing furnace on the day when you appear; Yahweh will engulf them in his
anger, and fire will devour them.

Psa 21:10 You will purge the earth of their descendants, the human race of their posterity.

Psa 21:11 They have devised evil against you but, plot as they may, they will not succeed,

Psa 21:12 since you will make them turn tail, by shooting your arrows in their faces.

Psa 21:13 Rise, Yahweh, in your power! We will sing and make music in honour of your strength.

<h4>The sufferings and hope of the upright</h4>

<p><em>For the choirmaster   To “the Doe of the Dawn”   Psalm   Of David</em></p>

<p>My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? <br />
The words of my groaning do nothing to save me. <br />
My God, I call by day but you do not answer, <br />
at night, but I find no respite. </p>

<p>Yet you, the Holy One, <br />
who make your home in the praises of Israel,<br />
in you our ancestors put their trust, <br />
they trusted and you set them free. <br />
To you they called for help and were delivered; <br />
in you they trusted and were not put to shame. </p>

<p>But I am a worm, not a man, <br />
scorn of mankind, contempt of the people;<br />
all who see me jeer at me, <br />
they sneer and wag their heads, <br />
“He trusted himself to Yahweh, let Yahweh set him free! <br />
Let him deliver him, as he took such delight in him”. </p>

<p>It was you who drew me from the womb <br />
and soothed me on my mother’s breast. <br />
On you was I cast from my birth, <br />
from the womb I have belonged to you. <br />
Do not hold aloof, for trouble is upon me, <br />
and no one to help me! </p>

<p>Many bulls are encircling me, <br />
wild bulls of Bashan closing in on me. <br />
Lions ravening and roaring <br />
open their jaws at me. </p>

<p>My strength is trickling away, <br />
my bones are all disjointed, <br />
my heart has turned to wax, <br />
melting inside me. <br />
My mouth is dry as earthenware, <br />
my tongue sticks to my jaw. <br />
You lay me down in the dust of death. </p>

<p>A pack of dogs surrounds me, <br />
a gang of villains closing in on me <br />
as if to hack off my hands and my feet. <br />
I can count every one of my bones, <br />
while they look on and gloat; <br />
they divide my garments among them <br />
and cast lots for my clothing. </p>

<p>Yahweh, do not hold aloof! <br />
My strength, come quickly to my help, <br />
rescue my soul from the sword, <br />
the one life I have from the grasp of the dog! <br />
Save me from the lion’s mouth, <br />
my poor life from the wild bulls’ horns! </p>

<p>I shall proclaim your name to my brothers, <br />
praise you in full assembly: <br />
“You who fear Yahweh, praise him! <br />
All the race of Jacob, honour him! <br />
Revere him, all the race of Israel!”. </p>

<p>For he has not despised <br />
nor disregarded the poverty of the poor, <br />
has not turned away his face, <br />
but has listened to the cry for help. </p>

<p>Of you is my praise in the thronged assembly, <br />
I will perform my vows before all who fear him. <br />
The poor will eat and be filled, <br />
those who seek Yahweh will praise him, <br />
“May your heart live for ever”. </p>

<p>The whole wide world will remember and return to Yahweh, <br />
all the families of nations bow down before him. <br />
For to Yahweh, ruler of the nations, belongs kingly power! <br />
All who prosper on earth will bow before him, <br />
all who go down to the dust will do reverence before him. <br />
And those who are dead, their descendants will serve him, <br />
will proclaim his name to generations still to come; <br />
and these will tell of his saving justice to a people yet unborn: <br />
he has fulfilled it. </p>

<hr />
Psa 23:1 [Psalm Of David] Yahweh is my shepherd, I lack nothing.

Psa 23:2 In grassy meadows he lets me lie. By tranquil streams he leads me

Psa 23:3 to restore my spirit. He guides me in paths of saving justice as befits his name.

Psa 23:4 Even were I to walk in a ravine as dark as death I should fear no danger, for you are at my side. Your
staff and your crook are there to soothe me.

Psa 23:5 You prepare a table for me under the eyes of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup brims
over.

Psa 23:6 Kindness and faithful love pursue me every day of my life. I make my home in the house of Yahweh
for all time to come.

Psa 24:1 [Psalm Of David] To Yahweh belong the earth and all it contains, the world and all who live there;

Psa 24:2 it is he who laid its foundations on the seas, on the flowing waters fixed it firm.

Psa 24:3 Who shall go up to the mountain of Yahweh? Who shall take a stand in his holy place?

Psa 24:4 The clean of hands and pure of heart, whose heart is not set on vanities, who does not swear an oath
in order to deceive.



Psa 24:5 Such a one will receive blessing from Yahweh, saving justice from the God of his salvation.

Psa 24:6 Such is the people that seeks him, that seeks your presence, God of Jacob. Pause

Psa 24:7 Gates, lift high your heads, raise high the ancient gateways, and the king of glory shall enter!

Psa 24:8 Who is he, this king of glory? It is Yahweh, strong and valiant, Yahweh valiant in battle.

Psa 24:9 Gates, lift high your heads, raise high the ancient gateways, and the king of glory shall enter!

Psa 24:10 Who is he, this king of glory? Yahweh Sabaoth, he is the king of glory. Pause
Psa 25:1 [Of David] ADORATION I offer, Yahweh,

Psa 25:2 to you, my God. BUT in my trust in you do not put me to shame, let not my enemies gloat over me.

Psa 25:3 CALLING to you, none shall ever be put to shame, but shame is theirs who groundlessly break faith.
Psa 25:4 DIRECT me in your ways, Yahweh, and teach me your paths.

Psa 25:5 ENCOURAGE me to walk in your truth and teach me since you are the God who saves me. FOR my
hope is in you all day long — such is your generosity, Yahweh.

Psa 25:6 GOODNESS and faithful love have been yours for ever, Yahweh, do not forget them.

Psa 25:7 HOLD not my youthful sins against me, but remember me as your faithful love dictates.

Psa 25:8 INTEGRITY and generosity are marks of Yahweh for he brings sinners back to the path.

Psa 25:9 JUDICIOUSLY he guides the humble, instructing the poor in his way.

Psa 25:10 KINDNESS unfailing and constancy mark all Yahweh’s paths, for those who keep his covenant and
his decrees.

Psa 25:1 1 LET my sin, great though it is, be forgiven, Yahweh, for the sake of your name.

Psa 25:12 MEN who respect Yahweh, what of them? He teaches them the way they must choose.

Psa 25:13 NEIGHBOURS to happiness will they live, and their children inherit the land.

Psa 25:14 ONLY those who fear Yahweh have his secret and his covenant, for their understanding.

Psa 25:15 PERMANENTLY my eyes are on Yahweh, for he will free my feet from the snare.

Psa 25:16 QUICK, turn to me, pity me, alone and wretched as I am!

Psa 25:17 RELIEVE the distress of my heart, bring me out of my constraint.

Psa 25:18 SPARE a glance for my misery and pain, take all my sins away.

Psa 25:19 TAKE note how countless are my enemies, how violent their hatred for me.

Psa 25:20 UNLESS you guard me and rescue me I shall be put to shame, for you are my refuge.

Psa 25:21 VIRTUE and integrity be my protection, for my hope, Yahweh, is in you.

Psa 25:22 Ransom Israel, O God, from all its troubles.

Psa 26:1 [Of David] Yahweh, be my judge! I go on my way in innocence, my trust in Yahweh never wavers.

Psa 26:2 Probe me, Yahweh, examine me, Test my heart and my mind in the fire.

Psa 26:3 For your faithful love is before my eyes, and I live my life by your truth.

Psa 26:4 No sitting with wastrels for me, no travelling with hypocrites;

Psa 26:5 I hate the company of sinners, I refuse to sit down with the wicked.

Psa 26:6 I will wash my hands in innocence and join the procession round your altar, Yahweh,

Psa 26:7 to make heard the sound of thanksgiving, to proclaim all your wonders.

Psa 26:8 Yahweh, I love the beauty of your house and the place where your glory dwells.

Psa 26:9 Do not couple me with sinners, nor my life with men of violence,

Psa 26:10 whose hands are stained with guilt, their right hands heavy with bribes.

Psa 26:1 1 In innocence I will go on my way; ransom me, take pity on me.

Psa 26:12 I take my stand on the right path; I will bless you, Yahweh, in the assemblies.

Psa 27:1 [Of David] Yahweh is my light and my salvation, whom should I fear? Yahweh is the fortress of my life,
whom should I dread?

Psa 27:2 When the wicked advance against me to eat me up, they, my opponents, my enemies, are the ones
who stumble and fall.

Psa 27:3 Though an army pitch camp against me, my heart will not fear, though war break out against me, my
trust will never be shaken.

Psa 27:4 One thing I ask of Yahweh, one thing I seek: to dwell in Yahweh’s house all the days of my life, to
enjoy the sweetness of Yahweh, to seek out his temple.

Psa 27:5 For he hides me away under his roof on the day of evil, he folds me in the recesses of his tent, sets
me high on a rock.

Psa 27:6 Now my head is held high above the enemies who surround me; in his tent I will offer sacrifices of
acclaim. I will sing, I will make music for Yahweh.

Psa 27:7 Yahweh, hear my voice as I cry, pity me, answer me!

Psa 27:8 Of you my heart has said, “Seek his face!”. Your face, Yahweh, I seek;

Psa 27:9 do not turn away from me. Do not thrust aside your servant in anger, without you I am helpless. Never
leave me, never forsake me, God, my Saviour.

Psa 27:10 Though my father and mother forsake me, Yahweh will gather me up.



Psa 27:1 1 Yahweh, teach me your way, lead me on the path of integrity because of my enemies;

Psa 27:12 do not abandon me to the will of my foes — false witnesses have risen against me, and are breathing
out violence.

Psa 27:13 This I believe: I shall see the goodness of Yahweh, in the land of the living.

Psa 27:14 Put your hope in Yahweh, be strong, let your heart be bold, put your hope in Yahweh.

Psa 28:1 [Of David] To you, Yahweh, I cry, my rock, do not be deaf to me! If you stay silent I shall be like those
who sink into oblivion.

Psa 28:2 Hear the sound of my prayer when I call upon you, when I raise my hands, Yahweh, towards your Holy
of Holies.

Psa 28:3 Do not drag me away with the wicked, with evil-doers, who talk to their partners of peace with
treachery in their hearts.

Psa 28:4 Repay them as their deeds deserve, as befits their treacherous actions; as befits their handiwork
repay them, let their deserts fall back on themselves.

Psa 28:5 They do not comprehend the deeds of Yahweh, the work of his hands. May he pull them down and not
rebuild them!

Psa 28:6 Blessed be Yahweh for he hears the sound of my prayer.

Psa 28:7 Yahweh is my strength and my shield, in him my heart trusts. I have been helped; my body has
recovered its vigour, with all my heart I thank him.

Psa 28:8 Yahweh is the strength of his people, a safe refuge for his anointed.

Psa 28:9 Save your people, bless your heritage, shepherd them and carry them for ever!

Psa 29:1 [Psalm Of David] Give Yahweh his due, sons of God, give Yahweh his due of glory and strength,

Psa 29:2 give Yahweh the glory due to his name, adore Yahweh in the splendour of holiness.

Psa 29:3 Yahweh’s voice over the waters, the God of glory thunders; Yahweh over countless waters,

Psa 29:4 Yahweh’s voice in power, Yahweh’s voice in splendour;

Psa 29:5 Yahweh’s voice shatters cedars, Yahweh shatters cedars of Lebanon,

Psa 29:6 he makes Lebanon skip like a calf, Sirion like a young wild ox.

Psa 29:7 Yahweh’s voice carves out lightning-shafts,

Psa 29:8 Yahweh’s voice convulses the desert, Yahweh convulses the desert of Kadesh,

Psa 29:9 Yahweh’s voice convulses terebinths, strips forests bare. In his palace all cry, “Glory!”.

Psa 29:10 Yahweh was enthroned for the flood, Yahweh is enthroned as king for ever.

Psa 29:1 1 Yahweh will give strength to his people, Yahweh blesses his people with peace.

Psa 30:1 [Psalm Canticle for the Dedication of the House Of David] I praise you to the heights, Yahweh, for you
have raised me up, you have not let my foes make merry over me.

Psa 30:2 Yahweh, my God, I cried to you for help and you healed me.

Psa 30:3 Yahweh, you have lifted me out of Sheol, from among those who sink into oblivion you have given me
life.

Psa 30:4 Make music for Yahweh, all you who are faithful to him, praise his unforgettable holiness.

Psa 30:5 His anger lasts but a moment, his favour through life; In the evening come tears, but with dawn cries of
joy.

Psa 30:6 Carefree, I used to think, “Nothing can ever shake me!”.

Psa 30:7 Your favour, Yahweh, set me on impregnable heights, but you turned away your face and I was
terrified.

Psa 30:8 To you, Yahweh, I call, to my God I cry for mercy.

Psa 30:9 What point is there in my death, my going down to the abyss? Can the dust praise you or proclaim
your faithfulness?

Psa 30:10 Listen, Yahweh, take pity on me, Yahweh, be my help!

Psa 30:1 1 You have turned my mourning into dancing, you have stripped off my sackcloth and clothed me with
joy.

Psa 30:12 So my heart will sing to you unceasingly, Yahweh, my God, I shall praise you for ever.

<p><em>For the choirmaster   Psalm   Of David</em></p>

<p>In you, Yahweh, I have taken refuge, <br />
let me never be put to shame, <br />
in your saving justice deliver me, rescue me, <br />
turn your ear to me, make haste. </p> 

<p>Be for me a rock-fastness, <br />

<p>Draw me out of the net they have spread for me, <br />

by you have I been redeemed. </p> 

<p>God of truth, you hate <br />
those who serve useless idols; <br />
but my trust is in Yahweh: <br />
I will delight and rejoice in your faithful love! </p> 

<p>You, who have seen my misery, <br />
and witnessed the miseries of my soul, <br />
have not handed me over to the enemy, <br />
but have given me freedom to roam at large. </p>

<p>Take pity on me, Yahweh, <br />

Vexation is gnawing away my eyes, <br />

<p>For my life is worn out with sorrow, <br />

My strength gives way under my misery, <br />

I have no more place in their hearts than a corpse, <br />

  scheming to take my life. </p>

<p>But my trust is in you, Yahweh; <br />
  I say, “You are my God”, <br />
every moment of my life is in your hands, rescue me <br />
  from the clutches of my foes who pursue me; <br />
let your face shine on your servant, <br />
  save me in your faithful love. </p>

<p>I call on you, Yahweh, so let disgrace fall not on me, <br />
  but on the wicked. <br />
Let them go down to Sheol in silence, <br />
  muzzles on their lying mouths, <br />
which speak arrogantly against the upright <br />
  in pride and contempt. </p>

<p>Yahweh, what quantities of good things <br />
  you have in store for those who fear you, <br />
and bestow on those who make you their refuge, <br />
 for all humanity to see. </p>

<p>Safe in your presence you hide them, <br />
  far from human plotting, <br />
shielding them in your tent, <br />
  far from contentious tongues. </p>

<p>Blessed be Yahweh who works for me <br />
  miracles of his faithful love <br />

In a state of terror I cried, <br />
  “I have been cut off from your sight!”. <br />
Yet you heard my plea for help <br />
  when I cried out to you. </p>

<p>Love Yahweh, all his faithful: <br />

Be brave, take heart, <br />

Psa 32:1 [Of David Poem] How blessed are those whose offence is forgiven, whose sin blotted out.

Psa 32:2 How blessed are those to whom Yahweh imputes no guilt, whose spirit harbours no deceit.

Psa 32:3 I said not a word, but my bones wasted away from groaning all the day;

Psa 32:4 day and night your hand lay heavy upon me; my heart grew parched as stubble in summer
drought.Pause

Psa 32:5 I made my sin known to you, did not conceal my guilt. I said, “I shall confess my offence to Yahweh”.
And you, for your part, took away my guilt, forgave my sin. Pause

Psa 32:6 That is why each of your faithful ones prays to you in time of distress. Even if great floods overflow,
they will never reach your faithful.

Psa 32:7 You are a refuge for me, you guard me in trouble, with songs of deliverance you surround me. Pause
Psa 32:8 I shall instruct you and teach you the way to go; I shall not take my eyes off you.

Psa 32:9 Be not like a horse or a mule; that does not understand bridle or bit; if you advance to master them,
there is no means of bringing them near.

Psa 32:10 Countless troubles are in store for the wicked, but one who trusts in Yahweh is enfolded in his faithful
love.

Psa 32:11 Rejoice in Yahweh, exult all you upright, shout for joy, you honest of heart.

Psa 33:1 Shout for joy, you upright; praise comes well from the honest.

Psa 33:2 Give thanks to Yahweh on the lyre, play for him on the ten-stringed lyre.

Psa 33:3 Sing to him a new song, make sweet music for your cry of victory.

Psa 33:4 The word of Yahweh is straightforward, all he does springs from his constancy.

Psa 33:5 He loves uprightness and justice; the faithful love of Yahweh fills the earth.

Psa 33:6 By the word of Yahweh the heavens were made, by the breath of his mouth all their array.

Psa 33:7 He collects the waters of the sea like a dam, he stores away the abyss in his treasure-house.

Psa 33:8 Let the whole earth fear Yahweh, let all who dwell in the world revere him;

Psa 33:9 for, the moment he spoke, it was so, no sooner had he commanded, than there it stood!

Psa 33:10 Yahweh thwarts the plans of nations, frustrates the counsels of peoples;

Psa 33:1 1 but Yahweh’s own plan stands firm for ever, his heart’s counsel from age to age.

Psa 33:12 How blessed the nation whose God is Yahweh, the people he has chosen as his heritage.

Psa 33:13 From heaven Yahweh looks down, he sees all the children of Adam,

Psa 33:14 from the place where he sits he watches all who dwell on the earth;

Psa 33:15 he alone moulds their hearts, he understands all they do.

Psa 33:16 A large army will not keep a king safe, nor his strength save a warrior’s life;

Psa 33:17 it is delusion to rely on a horse for safety, for all its power it cannot save.

Psa 33:18 But see how Yahweh watches over those who fear him, those who rely on his faithful love,



Psa 33:19 to rescue them from death and keep them alive in famine.

Psa 33:20 We are waiting for Yahweh; he is our help and our shield,

Psa 33:21 for in him our heart rejoices, in his holy name we trust.

Psa 33:22 Yahweh, let your faithful love rest on us, as our hope has rested in you.

<h4>Prayer of the virtuous in persecution</h4>

<p><em>Of David</em></p>

<p>Accuse my accusers, Yahweh, <br />
  attack my attackers. <br />
Grasp your buckler and shield, <br />
  up, and help me. <br />
Brandish spear and pike <br />
  to confront my pursuers, <br />
give me the assurance, “I am your Saviour”. </p>

<p>Shame and humiliation on those <br />
  who are out to kill me! <br />
Defeat and repulse in dismay <br />
  on those who plot my downfall. </p>

<p>May they be like chaff before the wind, <br />
  with the angel of Yahweh to chase them. <br />
May their way be dark and slippery, <br />
  with the angel of Yahweh to hound them.
</p>

<p>Unprovoked they laid their snare for me, <br />
  unprovoked dug a trap to kill me. <br />
Ruin comes upon them unawares; <br />
  the snare they have laid will catch them,<br />
  and into their own trap they will fall. </p>

<p>Then I shall delight in Yahweh, <br />
  rejoice that he has saved me. <br />
My very bones will all exclaim, <br />
  Yahweh, who can compare with you <br />
in rescuing the poor from the oppressor; <br />
  the needy from the exploiter? </p>

<p>False witnesses come forward against me <br />
  asking me questions I cannot answer, <br />
they cross-examine me, repay my kindness with cruelty, <br />
  make my life barren. </p>

<p>But I, when they were ill, had worn sackcloth, <br />
  and mortified myself with fasting, <br />
praying ever anew in my heart, <br />
  as if for a friend or brother; I had wandered restless, <br />
  as if mourning a mother, <br />
  so bowed had I been in sorrow. </p>

<p>When I stumble they gather in glee,<br />
  gather around me; <br />
strangers I never even knew <br />
  tear me apart incessantly. <br />
If I fall they surround me, <br />
  grinding their teeth at me. </p>

<p>How much longer, Lord, will you look on? <br />
Rescue me from their onslaughts, <br />
  from young lions rescue the one life that I have.
</p>

<p>I will give you thanks in the great assembly <br />
  praise you where the people gather. <br />
Let not my lying enemies <br />

Up, awake, to my defence, <br />

Psa 36:1 [For the choirmaster Of the servant of Yahweh Of David] Sin is the oracle of the wicked in the depths
of his heart; there is no fear of God before his eyes.

Psa 36:2 He sees himself with too flattering an eye to detect and detest his guilt;

Psa 36:3 all he says is malicious and deceitful, he has turned his back on wisdom. To get his way

Psa 36:4 he hatches malicious plots even in his bed; once set on his evil course no wickedness is too much for

him.

Psa 36:5 Yahweh, your faithful love is in the heavens, your constancy reaches to the clouds,

Psa 36:6 your saving justice is like towering mountains, your judgements like the mighty deep. Yahweh, you
support both man and beast;

Psa 36:7 how precious, God, is your faithful love. So the children of Adam take refuge in the shadow of your
wings.

Psa 36:8 They feast on the bounty of your house, you let them drink from your delicious streams;

Psa 36:9 in you is the source of life, by your light we see the light.

Psa 36:10 Maintain your faithful love to those who acknowledge you, and your saving justice to the honest of
heart.

Psa 36:1 1 Do not let the foot of the arrogant overtake me or wicked hands drive me away.

Psa 36:12 There they have fallen, the evil-doers, flung down, never to rise again.

Psa 37:1 [Of David] Do not get heated about the wicked or envy those who do wrong.

Psa 37:2 Quick as the grass they wither, fading like the green of the fields.

Psa 37:3 Put your trust in Yahweh and do right, make your home in the land and live secure.

Psa 37:4 Make Yahweh your joy and he will give you your heart’s desires.

Psa 37:5 Commit your destiny to Yahweh, be confident in him, and he will act,

Psa 37:6 making your uprightness clear as daylight, and the justice of your cause as the noon.

Psa 37:7 Stay quiet before Yahweh, wait longingly for him, do not get heated over someöne who is making a
fortune, succeeding by devious means.

Psa 37:8 Refrain from anger, leave rage aside, do not get heated — it can do no good;

Psa 37:9 for evil-doers will be annihilated, while those who hope in Yahweh shall have the land for their own.

Psa 37:10 A little while and the wicked will be no more, however well you search for the place, the wicked will
not be there;

Psa 37:1 1 but the poor will have the land for their own, to enjoy untroubled peace.

Psa 37:12 The wicked plots against the upright and gnashes his teeth at him,

Psa 37:13 but Yahweh only laughs at his efforts, knowing that his end is in sight.

Psa 37:14 Though the wicked draw his sword and bend his bow to slaughter the honest and bring down the
poor and the needy,

Psa 37:15 his sword will pierce his own heart, and his bow will be shattered.

Psa 37:16 What little the upright possesses outweighs all the wealth of the wicked;

Psa 37:17 for the weapons of the wicked shall be shattered, while Yahweh supports the upright.

Psa 37:18 The lives of the just are in Yahweh’s care, their birthright will endure for ever;

Psa 37:19 they will not be put to shame when bad times come, in time of famine they will have plenty.

Psa 37:20 The wicked, enemies of Yahweh, will be destroyed, they will vanish like the green of the pasture, they
will vanish in smoke.

Psa 37:21 The wicked borrows and will not repay, but the upright is generous in giving;

Psa 37:22 those he blesses will have the land for their own, and those he curses be annihilated.

Psa 37:23 Yahweh guides a strong man’s steps and keeps them firm; and takes pleasure in him.

Psa 37:24 When he trips he is not thrown sprawling, since Yahweh supports him by the hand.

Psa 37:25 Now I am old, but ever since my youth I never saw an upright person abandoned, or the descendants
of the upright forced to beg their bread.

Psa 37:26 The upright is always compassionate, always lending, so his descendants reap a blessing.

Psa 37:27 Turn your back on evil and do good, you will have a home for ever,

Psa 37:28 for Yahweh loves justice and will not forsake his faithful. Evil-doers will perish eternally, the
descendants of the wicked be annihilated,



Psa 37:29 but the upright shall have the land for their own, there they shall live for ever.

Psa 37:30 Wisdom comes from the lips of the upright, and his tongue speaks what is right;

Psa 37:31 the law of his God is in his heart, his foot will never slip.

Psa 37:32 The wicked keeps a close eye on the upright, looking out for a chance to kill him;

Psa 37:33 Yahweh will never abandon him to the clutches of the wicked, nor let him be condemned if he is tried.
Psa 37:34 Put your hope in Yahweh, keep to his path, he will raise you up to make the land your own; you will
look on while the wicked are annihilated.

Psa 37:35 I have seen the wicked exultant, towering like a cedar of Lebanon.

Psa 37:36 When next I passed he was gone, I searched for him and he was nowhere to be found.

Psa 37:37 Observe the innocent, consider the honest, for the lover of peace will not lack children.

Psa 37:38 But the wicked will all be destroyed together, and their children annihilated.

Psa 37:39 The upright have Yahweh for their Saviour, their refuge in times of trouble;

Psa 37:40 Yahweh helps them and rescues them, he will rescue them from the wicked, and save them because
they take refuge in him.

Psa 38:1 [Psalm Of David In commemoration] Yahweh, do not correct me in anger, do not discipline me in
wrath.

Psa 38:2 For your arrows have pierced deep into me, your hand has pressed down upon me.

Psa 38:3 Your indignation has left no part of me unscathed, my sin has left no health in my bones.

Psa 38:4 My sins stand higher than my head, they weigh on me as an unbearable weight.

Psa 38:5 I have stinking, festering wounds, thanks to my folly.

Psa 38:6 I am twisted and bent double, I spend my days in gloom.

Psa 38:7 My loins burn with fever, no part of me is unscathed.

Psa 38:8 Numbed and utterly crushed I groan in distress of heart.

Psa 38:9 Lord, all my longing is known to you, my sighing no secret from you,

Psa 38:10 my heart is throbbing, my strength has failed, the light has gone out of my eyes.

Psa 38:1 1 Friends and companions shun my disease, even the dearest of them keep their distance.

Psa 38:12 Those with designs on my life lay snares, those who wish me ill speak of violence and hatch
treachery all day long.

Psa 38:13 But I hear nothing, as though I were deaf, as though dumb, saying not a word.

Psa 38:14 I am like the one who, hearing nothing, has no sharp answer to make.

Psa 38:15 For in you, Yahweh, I put my hope, you, Lord my God, will give answer.

Psa 38:16 I said, “Never let them gloat over me, do not let them take advantage of me if my foot slips”.

Psa 38:17 There is no escape for me from falling, no relief from my misery.

Psa 38:18 But I make no secret of my guilt, I am anxious at the thought of my sin.

Psa 38:19 There is no numbering those who oppose me without cause, no counting those who hate me
unprovoked,

Psa 38:20 repaying me evil for good, slandering me for trying to do them good.

Psa 38:21 Yahweh, do not desert me, my God, do not stand aloof from me.

Psa 38:22 Come quickly to my help, Lord, my Saviour!

Psa 39:1 [For the choirmaster For Jeduthun Psalm Of David] I said, “I will watch how I behave so that I do not

sin by my tongue. I will keep a muzzle on my mouth as long as any sinner is near”.

Psa 39:2 I stayed dumb, silent, speechless, but the sinner’s prosperity redoubled my torment.

Psa 39:3 My heart had been smouldering within me, but at the thought of this it flared up and the words came
bursting out,

Psa 39:4 “Yahweh, let me know my fate, how much longer I have to live. Show me just how frail I am.

Psa 39:5 “Look, you have given me but a hand’s breadth or two of life, the length of my life is as nothing to you.

Every human being that stands on earth is a mere puff of wind,

Psa 39:6 every human being that walks only a shadow; a mere puff of wind is the wealth stored away — no
knowing who will profit from it”.

Psa 39:7 So now, Lord, what am I to hope for? My hope is in you.

Psa 39:8 Save me from all my sins, do not make me the butt of fools.

Psa 39:9 I keep silence, I speak no more since you yourself have been at work.

Psa 39:10 Take your scourge away from me. I am worn out by the blows you deal me.

Psa 39:1 1 You correct human beings by punishing sin, like a moth you eat away all their desires — a human
being is a mere puff of wind.

Psa 39:12 Yahweh, hear my prayer, listen to my cry for help, do not remain deaf to my weeping. For I am a
stranger in your house, a nomad like all my ancestors.

Psa 39:13 Turn away your gaze that I may breathe freely before I depart and am no more!

Psa 41:1 [For the choirmaster Psalm Of David] Blessed is anyone who cares for the poor and the weak; in time
of trouble Yahweh rescues him.

Psa 41 :2 Yahweh protects him, gives him life and happiness on earth. Do not abandon him to his enemies’
pleasure!

Psa 41 :3 Yahweh sustains him on his bed of sickness; you transform altogether the bed where he lies sick.

Psa 41 :4 For my part I said, “Yahweh, take pity on me! Cure me for I have sinned against you”.

Psa 41 :5 My enemies speak to me only of disaster, “When will he die and his name disappear?”.

Psa 41 :6 When people come to see me their talk is hollow, when they get out they spread the news with spite in
their hearts.

Psa 41 :7 All who hate me whisper together about me and reckon I deserve the misery I suffer.

Psa 41 :8 “A fatal sickness has a grip on him; now that he is down, he will never get up again”.

Psa 41 :9 Even my trusted friend on whom I relied, who shared my table, takes advantage of me.

Psa 41:10 But you, Yahweh, take pity on me! Put me on my feet and I will give them their due.

Psa 41:11 This will convince me that you delight in me, if my enemy no longer exults over me.

Psa 41:12 Then you will keep me unscathed, and set me in your presence for ever.

Psa 41:13 Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, from eternity to eternity. Amen, Amen.

Psa 42:1 [For the choirmaster Poem Of the sons of Korah] As a deer yearns for running streams, so I yearn for
you, my God.

Psa 42:2 I thirst for God, the living God; when shall I go to see the face of God?

Psa 42:3 I have no food but tears day and night, as all day long I am taunted, “Where is your God?”.

Psa 42:4 This I remember as I pour out my heart, how I used to pass under the roof of the Most High used to go
to the house of God, among cries of joy and praise, the sound of the feast.

Psa 42:5 Why be so downcast, why all these sighs? Hope in God! I will praise him still, my Saviour,

Psa 42:6 my God. When I am downcast I think of you: from the land of Jordan and Hermon, I think of you,
humble mountain.

Psa 42:7 Deep is calling to deep by the roar of your cataracts, all your waves and breakers have rolled over me.

Psa 42:8 In the daytime God sends his faithful love, and even at night; the song it inspires in me is a prayer to

my living God.

Psa 42:9 I shall say to God, my rock, “Why have you forgotten me? Why must I go around in mourning,
harrassed by the enemy?”.



Psa 42:10 With death in my bones, my enemies taunt me, all day long they ask me, “Where is your God?”.

Psa 42:1 1 Why so downcast, why all these sighs? Hope in God! I will praise him still, my Saviour, my God.

Psa 43:1 Judge me, God, defend my cause against a people who have no faithful love; from those who are
treacherous and unjust, rescue me.

Psa 43:2 For you are the God of my strength; why abandon me? Why must I go around in mourning, harrassed
by the enemy?

Psa 43:3 Send out your light and your truth; they shall be my guide, to lead me to your holy mountain to the
place where you dwell.

Psa 43:4 Then I shall go to the altar of God, to the God of my joy. I will rejoice and praise you on the harp, O
God, my God.

Psa 43:5 Why so downcast, why all these sighs? Hope in God! I will praise him still, my Saviour, my God.

Psa 44:1 [For the choirmaster Of the sons of Korah Poem] God, we have heard for ourselves, our ancestors
have told us, of the deeds you did in their days, in days of old,

Psa 44:2 by your hand. To establish them in the land you drove out nations, to make room for them you harried
peoples.

Psa 44:3 It was not their own sword that won the land, nor their own arms which made them victorious, but your
hand it was and your arm, and the light of your presence, for you loved them.

Psa 44:4 You are my king, my God, who decreed Jacob’s victories;

Psa 44:5 through you we conquered our opponents, in your name we trampled down those who rose up against
us.

Psa 44:6 For my trust was not in my bow, my victory was not won by my sword;

Psa 44:7 it was you who saved us from our opponents, you who put to shame those who hate us.

Psa 44:8 Our boast was always of God, we praised your name without ceasing. Pause

Psa 44:9 Yet now you have abandoned and humiliated us, you no longer take the field with our armies,

Psa 44:10 you leave us to fall back before the enemy, those who hate us plunder us at will.

Psa 44:1 1 You hand us over like sheep for slaughter, you scatter us among the nations,

Psa 44:12 you sell your people for a trifle and make no profit on the sale.

Psa 44:13 You make us the butt of our neighbours, the mockery and scorn of those around us,

Psa 44:14 you make us a by-word among nations, other peoples shake their heads over us.

Psa 44: 1 5 All day long I brood on my disgrace, the shame written clear on my face,

Psa 44:16 from the sound of insult and abuse, from the sight of hatred and vengefulness.

Psa 44:17 All this has befallen us though we had not forgotten you, nor been disloyal to your covenant,

Psa 44:18 our hearts never turning away, our feet never straying from your path.

Psa 44:19 Yet you have crushed us in the place where jackals live, and immersed us in shadow dark as death.
Psa 44:20 Had we forgotten the name of our God and stretched out our hands to a foreign god,

Psa 44:21 would not God have found this out, for he knows the secrets of the heart?

Psa 44:22 For your sake we are being massacred all day long, treated as sheep to be slaughtered.

Psa 44:23 Wake, Lord! Why are you asleep? Awake! Do not abandon us for good.

Psa 44:24 Why do you turn your face away, forgetting that we are poor and harrassed?

Psa 44:25 For we are bowed down to the dust, and lie prone on the ground.

Psa 44:26 Arise! Come to our help! Ransom us, as your faithful love demands.

Psa 45:1 [For the choirmaster Tune: “Lilies . . ”. Of the sons of Korah Poem Love song] My heart is stirred by a
noble theme, I address my poem to the king, my tongue the pen of an expert scribe.

Psa 45:2 Of all men you are the most handsome, gracefulness is a dew upon your lips, for God has blessed you
for ever.

Psa 45:3 Warrior, strap your sword at your side, in your majesty and splendour advance,

Psa 45:4 ride on in the cause of truth, gentleness and uprightness. Stretch the bowstring tight, lending terror to
your right hand.

Psa 45:5 Your arrows are sharp, nations lie at your mercy, the king’s enemies lose heart.

Psa 45:6 Your throne is from God, for ever and ever, the sceptre of your kingship a sceptre of justice,

Psa 45:7 you love uprightness and detest evil. This is why God, your God, has anointed you with oil of
gladness, as none of your rivals,

Psa 45:8 your robes all myrrh and aloes. From palaces of ivory, harps bring you joy,

Psa 45:9 in your retinue are daughters of kings, the consort at your right hand in gold of Ophir.

Psa 45:10 Listen, my daughter, attend to my words and hear; forget your own nation and your ancestral home,
Psa 45:1 1 then the king will fall in love with your beauty; he is your lord, bow down before him.

Psa 45:12 The daughter of Tyre will court your favour with gifts, and the richest of peoples
Psa 45:13 with jewels set in gold. Clothed

Psa 45:14 in brocade, the king’s daughter is led within to the king with the maidens of her retinue; her



companions are brought to her,

Psa 45:15 they enter the king’s palace with joy and rejoicing.

Psa 45:16 Instead of your ancestors you will have sons; you will make them rulers over the whole world.

Psa 45:17 I will make your name endure from generation to generation, so nations will sing your praise for ever
and ever.

Psa 46:1 [For the choirmaster Of the sons of Korah For oboe Song] God is both refuge and strength for us, a
help always ready in trouble;

Psa 46:2 so we shall not be afraid though the earth be in turmoil, though mountains tumble into the depths of
the sea,

Psa 46:3 and its waters roar and seethe, and the mountains totter as it heaves. (Yahweh Sabaoth is with us, our
citadel, the God of Jacob. )Pause

Psa 46:4 There is a river whose streams bring joy to God’s city, it sanctifies the dwelling of the Most High.

Psa 46:5 God is in the city, it cannot fall; at break of day God comes to its rescue.

Psa 46:6 Nations are in uproar, kingdoms are tumbling, when he raises his voice the earth crumbles away.

Psa 46:7 Yahweh Sabaoth is with us, our citadel, the God of Jacob. Pause

Psa 46:8 Come, consider the wonders of Yahweh, the astounding deeds he has done on the earth;

Psa 46:9 he puts an end to wars over the whole wide world, he breaks the bow, he snaps the spear, shields he
burns in the fire.

Psa 46:10 “Be still and acknowledge that I am God, supreme over nations, supreme over the world”.

Psa 46:1 1 Yahweh Sabaoth is with us, our citadel, the God of Jacob. Pause

Psa 47:1 [For the choirmaster Of the sons of Korah Psalm] Clap your hands, all peoples, acclaim God with
shouts of joy.

Psa 47:2 For Yahweh, the Most High, is glorious, the great king over all the earth.

Psa 47:3 He brings peoples under our yoke and nations under our feet.

Psa 47:4 He chooses for us our birthright, the pride of Jacob whom he loves. Pause
Psa 47:5 God goes up to shouts of acclaim, Yahweh to a fanfare on the ram’s horn.

Psa 47:6 Let the music sound for our God, let it sound, let the music sound for our king, let it sound.

Psa 47:7 For he is king of the whole world; learn the music, let it sound for God!

Psa 47:8 God reigns over the nations, seated on his holy throne.

Psa 47:9 The leaders of the nations rally to the people of the God of Abraham. The shields of the earth belong
to God, who is exalted on high.

Psa 48:1 [Song Psalm Of the sons of Korah] Great is Yahweh and most worthy of praise in the city of our God,
the holy mountain,

Psa 48:2 towering in beauty, the joy of the whole world: Mount Zion in the heart of the north, the settlement of
the great king;

Psa 48:3 God himself among its palaces has proved himself its bulwark.

Psa 48:4 For look, kings made alliance, together they advanced;

Psa 48:5 without a second glance, when they saw, they panicked and fled away.

Psa 48:6 Trembling seized them on the spot, pains like those of a woman in labour;

Psa 48:7 it was the east wind, that wrecker of ships from Tarshish.

Psa 48:8 What we had heard we saw for ourselves in the city of our God, in the city of Yahweh Sabaoth, which
God has established for ever.Pause

Psa 48:9 We reflect on your faithful love, God, in your temple!

Psa 48:10 Both your name and your praise, God, are over the whole wide world. Your right hand is full of saving
justice,

Psa 48:1 1 Mount Zion rejoices, the daughters of Judah delight because of your saving justice.

Psa 48:12 Go round Zion, walk right through her, count her bastions,

Psa 48:13 admire her walls, examine her palaces, to tell future generations
Psa 48:14 that such is God; our God for ever and ever, he is our guide!

Psa 49:1 [For the choirmaster Of the sons of Korah Psalm] Hear this, all nations, listen, all who dwell on earth,
Psa 49:2 people high and low, rich and poor alike!

Psa 49:3 My lips have wisdom to utter, my heart good sense to whisper.

Psa 49:4 I listen carefully to a proverb, I set my riddle to the music of the harp.

Psa 49:5 Why should I be afraid in times of trouble? Malice dogs me and hems me in.

Psa 49:6 They trust in their wealth, and boast of the profusion of their riches.

Psa 49:7 But no one can ever redeem himself or pay his own ransom to God,

Psa 49:8 the price for himself is too high; it can never be

Psa 49:9 that he will live on for ever and avoid the sight of the abyss.

Psa 49:10 For he will see the wise also die no less than the fool and the brute, and leave their wealth behind for



others.

Psa 49:1 1 For ever no home but their tombs, their dwelling-place age after age, though they gave their name to
whole territories.

Psa 49:12 In prosperity people lose their good sense, they become no better than dumb animals.

Psa 49:13 So they go on in their self-assurance, right up to the end they are content with their lot. Pause
Psa 49:14 They are penned in Sheol like sheep, Death will lead them to pasture, and those who are honest will
rule over them. In the morning all trace of them will be gone, Sheol will be their home.

Psa 49:15 But my soul God will ransom from the clutches of Sheol, and will snatch me up. Pause
Psa 49:16 Do not be overawed when someöne gets rich, and lives in ever greater splendour;

Psa 49:17 when he dies he will take nothing with him, his wealth will not go down with him.

Psa 49:18 Though he pampered himself while he lived — and people praise you for looking after yourself-
Psa 49:19 he will go to join the ranks of his ancestors, who will never again see the light.

Psa 49:20 In prosperity people lose their good sense, they become no better than dumb animals.

Psa 50:1 [Psalm Of Asaph] The God of gods, Yahweh, is speaking, from east to west he summons the earth.
Psa 50:2 From Zion, perfection of beauty, he shines forth;

Psa 50:3 he is coming, our God, and will not be silent. Devouring fire ahead of him, raging tempest around him,
Psa 50:4 he summons the heavens from on high, and the earth to judge his people.

Psa 50:5 “Gather to me my faithful, who sealed my covenant by sacrifice”.

Psa 50:6 The heavens proclaim his saving justice, “God himself is judge. “Pause

Psa 50:7 “Listen, my people, I am speaking, Israel, I am giving evidence against you, I, God, your God.

Psa 50:8 “It is not with your sacrifices that I find fault, those burnt offerings constantly before me;

Psa 50:9 I will not accept any bull from your homes, nor a single goat from your folds.

Psa 50:10 “For all forest creatures are mine already, the animals on the mountains in their thousands.

Psa 50:1 1 I know every bird in the air, whatever moves in the fields is mine.

Psa 50:12 “If I am hungry I shall not tell you, since the world and all it holds is mine.

Psa 50:13 Am I to eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats?

Psa 50:14 “Let thanksgiving be your sacrifice to God, fulfil the vows you make to the Most High;

Psa 50:15 then if you call to me in time of trouble I will rescue you and you will honour me”.

Psa 50:16 But to the wicked, God says: “What right have you to recite my statutes, to take my covenant on your
lips,

Psa 50:17 when you detest my teaching, and thrust my words behind you?

Psa 50:18 “You make friends with a thief as soon as you see one, you feel at home with adulterers,

Psa 50:19 your conversation is devoted to wickedness, and your tongue to inventing lies.

Psa 50:20 “You sit there, slandering your own brother, you malign your own mother’s son.

Psa 50:21 You do this, and am I to say nothing? Do you think that I am really like you? I charge you, indict you
to your face.

Psa 50:22 “Think it out, you who forget God, or I will tear you apart without hope of a rescuer.

Psa 50:23 Honour to me is a sacrifice of thanksgiving; to the upright I will show God’s salvation”.

Psa 51:1 [For the choirmaster Of David When the prophet Nathan had come to him because he had gone to
Bathsheba] Have mercy on me, O God, in your faithful love, in your great tenderness wipe away my offences;
Psa 51 :2 wash me clean from my guilt, purify me from my sin.

Psa 51 :3 For I am well aware of my offences, my sin is constantly in mind.

Psa 51 :4 Against you, you alone, I have sinned, I have done what you see to be wrong, that you may show your
saving justice when you pass sentence, and your victory may appear when you give judgement,

Psa 51 :5 remember, I was born guilty, a sinner from the moment of conception.

Psa 51 :6 But you delight in sincerity of heart, and in secret you teach me wisdom.

Psa 51 :7 Purify me with hyssop till I am clean, wash me till I am whiter than snow.

Psa 51 :8 Let me hear the sound of joy and gladness, and the bones you have crushed will dance.

Psa 51 :9 Turn away your face from my sins, and wipe away all my guilt.

Psa 51:10 God, create in me a clean heart, renew within me a resolute spirit,

Psa 51:11 do not thrust me away from your presence, do not take away from me your spirit of holiness.

Psa 51:12 Give me back the joy of your salvation, sustain in me a generous spirit.

Psa 51:13 I shall teach the wicked your paths, and sinners will return to you.

Psa 51:14 Deliver me from bloodshed, God, God of my salvation, and my tongue will acclaim your saving
justice.

Psa 51:15 Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will speak out your praise.

Psa 51:16 Sacrifice gives you no pleasure, burnt offering you do not desire.

Psa 51:17 Sacrifice to God is a broken spirit, a broken, contrite heart you never scorn.

Psa 51:18 In your graciousness do good to Zion, rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.



Psa 51:19 Then you will delight in upright sacrifices, -burnt offerings and whole oblations — and young bulls will
be offered on your altar.

<hr />
Psa 55:1 [For the choirmaster For strings Poem Of David] God, hear my prayer, do not hide away from my plea,
Psa 55:2 give me a hearing, answer me, my troubles give me no peace. I shudder

Psa 55:3 at the enemy’s shouts, at the outcry of the wicked; they heap up charges against me, in their anger
bring hostile accusations against me.

Psa 55:4 My heart writhes within me, the terrors of death come upon me,

Psa 55:5 fear and trembling overwhelm me, and shuddering grips me.

Psa 55:6 And I say, “Who will give me wings like a dove, to fly away and find rest?”.

Psa 55:7 How far I would escape, and make a nest in the desertIPause
Psa 55:8 I would soon find a refuge from the storm of abuse, from the

Psa 55:9 destructive tempest, Lord, from the flood of their tongues. For I see violence and strife in the city,

Psa 55:10 day and night they make their rounds along the city walls, Inside live malice and mischief,

Psa 55:1 1 inside lives destruction, tyranny and treachery never absent from its central square.

Psa 55:12 Were it an enemy who insulted me, that I could bear; if an opponent pitted himself against me, I could
turn away from him.

Psa 55:13 But you, a person of my own rank, a comrade and dear friend,

Psa 55:14 to whom I was bound by intimate friendship in the house of God! May they recoil in disorder,

Psa 55:15 may death descend on them, may they go down alive to Sheol, since evil shares their home with
them.

Psa 55:16 For my part, I appeal to God, and Yahweh saves me;

Psa 55:17 evening, morning, noon, I complain and I groan. He hears my cry,

Psa 55:18 he ransoms me and gives me peace from the feud against me, for they are taking me to law.

Psa 55:19 But God will listen and will humble them, he who has been enthroned from the beginning; no change
of heart for them, for they do not fear God.



Psa 55:20 They attack those at peace with them, going back on their oaths;

Psa 55:21 though their mouth is smoother than butter, enmity is in their hearts; their words more soothing than
oil, yet sharpened like swords.

Psa 55:22 Unload your burden onto Yahweh and he will sustain you; never will he allow the upright to stumble.
Psa 55:23 You, God, will thrust them down to the abyss of destruction, men bloodthirsty and deceptive, before
half their days are spent. For my part, I put my trust in you.

Psa 60:3 You have forced your people to drink a bitter draught, forced us to drink a wine that made us reel.

Psa 60:4 You gave a signal to those who fear you to let them escape out of range of the bow. Pause
Psa 60:5 To rescue those you love, save with your right hand and answer us.

Psa 60:6 God has spoken from his sanctuary, “In triumph I will divide up Shechem, and share out the Valley of
Succoth.

Psa 60:7 “Mine is Gilead, mine Manasseh, Ephraim the helmet on my head, Judah my commander’s baton,

Psa 60:8 “Moab a bowl for me to wash in, on Edom I plant my sandal. Now try shouting ‘Victory!’. over me,
Philistia!”.

Psa 60:9 Who will lead me against a fortified city, who will guide me into Edom,

Psa 60:10 if not you, the God who has rejected us? God, you no longer march with our armies.

Psa 60:1 1 Bring us help in our time of crisis, any human help is worthless.

Psa 60:12 With God we shall do deeds of valour, he will trample down our enemies.

Psa 61:1 [For the choirmaster For strings Of David] God, hear my cry, listen to my prayer.

Psa 61 :2 From the end of the earth I call to you with fainting heart. Lead me to the high rock that stands far out
of my reach.

Psa 61 :3 For you are my refuge, a strong tower against the enemy.

Psa 61 :4 Let me stay in your tent for ever, taking refuge in the shelter of your wings!

Psa 61 :5 For you, God, accept my vows, you grant me the heritage of those who fear your name.

Psa 61 :6 Let the king live on and on, let his years continue age after age.

Psa 61 :7 May his throne be always in God’s presence, your faithful love and constancy watch over him.

Psa 61 :8 Then I shall always sing to your name, day after day fulfilling my vows.

Psa 62:1 [For the choirmaster … Jeduthun Psalm Of David] In God alone there is rest for my soul, from him
comes my safety;

Psa 62:2 he alone is my rock, my safety, my stronghold so that I stand unshaken.

Psa 62:3 How much longer will you set on a victim, all together, intent on murder, like a rampart already leaning
over, a wall already damaged?

Psa 62:4 Trickery is their only plan, deception their only pleasure, with lies on their lips they pronounce a
blessing, with a curse in their hearts. Pause

Psa 62:5 Rest in God alone, my soul! He is the source of my hope.

Psa 62:6 He alone is my rock, my safety, my stronghold, so that I stand unwavering.

Psa 62:7 In God is my safety and my glory, the rock of my strength. In God is my refuge;

Psa 62:8 trust in him, you people, at all times. Pour out your hearts to him, God is a refuge for us. Pause
Psa 62:9 Ordinary people are a mere puff of wind, important people a delusion; set both on the scales together,
and they are lighter than a puff of wind.

Psa 62:10 Put no trust in extortion, no empty hopes in robbery; however much wealth may multiply, do not set
your heart on it.

Psa 62:1 1 Once God has spoken, twice have I heard this: Strength belongs to God,

Psa 62:12 to you, Lord, faithful love; and you repay everyone as their deeds deserve.

<h4>Yearning for God</h4>

<p><em>Psalm   Of David   When he was in the desert of Judah</em></p>

<p>God, you are my God, I pine for you; <br />
my heart thirsts for you, <br />
my body longs for you, <br />
as a land parched, dreary and waterless.<br />
Thus I have gazed on you in the sanctuary, <br />
seeing your power and your glory. </p>

<p>Better your faithful love than life itself; <br />
my lips will praise you. <br />
Thus I will bless you all my life, <br />
in your name lift up my hands. <br />
All my longings fulfilled as with fat and rich foods, <br />
a song of joy on my lips and praise in my mouth. </p>

<p>On my bed when I think of you, <br />
I muse on you in the watches of the night, <br />
for you have always been my help; <br />
in the shadow of your wings I rejoice; <br />
my heart clings to you, <br />
your right hand supports me. </p>

<p>May those who are hounding me to death <br />
go down to the depths of the earth, <br />
given over to the blade of the sword, <br />
and left as food for jackals. <br />
Then the king shall rejoice in God, <br />
all who swear by him shall gain recognition, <br />
for the mouths of liars shall be silenced. </p>

Psa 64:1 [For the choirmaster Psalm Of David] Listen, God, to my voice as I plead, protect my life from fear of
the enemy;

Psa 64:2 hide me from the league of the wicked, from the gang of evil-doers.

Psa 64:3 They sharpen their tongues like a sword, aim their arrows of poisonous abuse,

Psa 64:4 shoot at the innocent from cover, shoot suddenly, with nothing to fear.

Psa 64:5 They support each other in their evil designs, they discuss how to lay their snares. “Who will see us?”.
they say,

Psa 64:6 “or will penetrate our secrets?”. He will do that, he who penetrates human nature to its depths, the
depths of the heart.

Psa 64:7 God has shot them with his arrow, sudden were their wounds.

Psa 64:8 He brings them down because of their tongue, and all who see them shake their heads.

Psa 64:9 Everyone will be awestruck, proclaim what God has done, and understand why he has done it.

Psa 64:10 The upright will rejoice in Yahweh, will take refuge in him, and all the honest will praise him.

Psa 65:1 [For the choirmaster Psalm Of David Song] Praise is rightfully yours, God, in Zion. Vows to you shall
be fulfilled,

Psa 65:2 for you answer prayer. All humanity must come to you

Psa 65:3 with its sinful deeds. Our faults overwhelm us, but you blot them out.

Psa 65:4 How blessed those whom you choose and invite to dwell in your courts. We shall be filled with the
good things of your house, of your holy temple.

Psa 65:5 You respond to us with the marvels of your saving justice, God our Saviour, hope of the whole wide
world, even the distant islands.

Psa 65:6 By your strength you hold the mountains steady, being clothed in power,

Psa 65:7 you calm the turmoil of the seas, the turmoil of their waves. The nations are in uproar, in panic those
who live at the ends of the earth;

Psa 65:8 your miracles bring shouts of joy to the gateways of morning and evening.

Psa 65:9 You visit the earth and make it fruitful, you fill it with riches; the river of God brims over with water, you
provide the grain. To that end

Psa 65:10 you water its furrows abundantly, level its ridges, soften it with showers and bless its shoots.

Psa 65:1 1 You crown the year with your generosity, richness seeps from your tracks,

Psa 65:12 the pastures of the desert grow moist, the hillsides are wrapped in joy,

Psa 65:13 the meadows are covered with flocks, the valleys clothed with wheat; they shout and sing for joy.

Psa 66:1 [For the choirmaster Song Psalm] Acclaim God, all the earth,

Psa 66:2 sing psalms to the glory of his name, glorify him with your praises,

Psa 66:3 say to God, “How awesome you are! “Your achievements are the measure of your power, your
enemies woo your favour,

Psa 66:4 all the earth bows down before you, sings psalms to you, sings psalms to your name. “Pause
Psa 66:5 Come and see the marvels of God, his awesome deeds for the children of Adam:

Psa 66:6 he changed the sea into dry land, they crossed the river on foot. So let us rejoice in him,

Psa 66:7 who rules for ever by his power; his eyes keep watch on the nations to forestall rebellion against
him. Pause

Psa 66:8 Nations, bless our God, let the sound of his praise be heard;

Psa 66:9 he brings us to life and keeps our feet from stumbling.

Psa 66:10 God, you have put us to the test, refined us like silver,

Psa 66:1 1 let us fall into the net; you have put a heavy strain on our backs,

Psa 66:12 let men ride over our heads; but now the ordeal by fire and water is over, you have led us out to
breathe again.



Psa 66:13 I bring burnt offerings to your house, I fulfil to you my vows,

Psa 66:14 the vows that rose to my lips, that I pronounced when I was in trouble.

Psa 66:15 I will offer you rich burnt offerings, with the smoke of burning rams. I will sacrifice to you bullocks and
goats. Pause

Psa 66:16 Come and listen, all who fear God, while I tell what he has done for me.

Psa 66:17 To him I cried aloud, high praise was on my tongue.

Psa 66:18 Had I been aware of guilt in my heart, the Lord would not have listened,

Psa 66:19 but in fact God did listen, attentive to the sound of my prayer.

Psa 66:20 Blessed be God who has not turned away my prayer, nor his own faithful love from me.

Psa 67:1 [For the choirmaster For strings Psalm Song] May God show kindness and bless us, and make his
face shine on us. Pause

Psa 67:2 Then the earth will acknowledge your ways, and all nations your power to save.

Psa 67:3 Let the nations praise you, God, let all the nations praise you.

Psa 67:4 Let the nations rejoice and sing for joy, for you judge the world with justice, you judge the peoples with
fairness, you guide the nations on earth. Pause

Psa 67:5 Let the nations praise you, God, let all the nations praise you.

Psa 67:6 The earth has yielded its produce; God, our God has blessed us.

Psa 67:7 May God continue to bless us, and be revered by the whole wide world.

Psa 68:1 [For the choirmaster Of David Psalm Song] Let God arise, let his enemies scatter, let his opponents
flee before him.

Psa 68:2 You disperse them like smoke; as wax melts in the presence of a fire, so the wicked melt at the
presence of God.

Psa 68:3 The upright rejoice in the presence of God, delighted and crying out for joy.

Psa 68:4 Sing to God, play music to his name, build a road for the Rider of the Clouds, rejoice in Yahweh,
dance before him.

Psa 68:5 Father of orphans, defender of widows, such is God in his holy dwelling.

Psa 68:6 God gives the lonely a home to live in, leads prisoners out into prosperity, but rebels must live in the
bare wastelands.

Psa 68:7 God, when you set out at the head of your people, when you strode over the desert,

Psa 68:8 the earth rocked, Pause the heavens pelted down rain at the presence of God, at the presence of God,
the God of Israel.

Psa 68:9 God, you rained down a shower of blessings, when your heritage was weary you gave it strength.

Psa 68:10 Your family found a home, which you in your generosity provided for the humble.

Psa 68:1 1 The Lord gave a command, the good news of a countless army.

Psa 68:12 The chieftains of the army are in flight, in flight, and the fair one at home is sharing out the spoils.

Psa 68:13 While you are at ease in the sheepfolds, the wings of the Dove are being covered with silver, and her
feathers with a sheen of green gold;

Psa 68:14 when Shaddai scatters the chieftains, through her it snows on the Dark Mountain.

Psa 68:15 A mountain of God, the mountain of Bashan! a haughty mountain, the mountain of Bashan!

Psa 68:16 Why be envious, haughty mountains, of the mountain God has chosen for his dwelling? There God
will dwell for ever.

Psa 68:17 The chariots of God are thousand upon thousand; God has come from Sinai to the sanctuary.

Psa 68:18 You have climbed the heights, taken captives, you have taken men as tribute, even rebels that
Yahweh God might have a dwelling-place.

Psa 68:19 Blessed be the Lord day after day, he carries us along, God our Saviour.Pause
Psa 68:20 This God of ours is a God who saves; from Lord Yahweh comes escape from death;

Psa 68:21 but God smashes the head of his enemies, the long-haired skull of the prowling criminal.

Psa 68:22 The Lord has said, “I will bring them back from Bashan, I will bring them back from the depths of the
sea,

Psa 68:23 so that you may bathe your feet in blood, and the tongues of your dogs feast on your enemies”.

Psa 68:24 Your processions, God, are for all to see, the processions of my God, of my king, to the sanctuary;
Psa 68:25 singers ahead, musicians behind, in the middle come girls, beating their drums.

Psa 68:26 In choirs they bless God, Yahweh, since the foundation of Israel.

Psa 68:27 Benjamin was there, the youngest in front, the princes of Judah in bright-coloured robes, the princes
of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali.

Psa 68:28 Take command, my God, as befits your power, the power, God, which you have wielded for us,

Psa 68:29 from your temple high above Jerusalem. Kings will come to you bearing tribute.

Psa 68:30 Rebuke the Beast of the Reeds, that herd of bulls, that people of calves, who bow down with ingots
of silver. Scatter the people who delight in war.



Psa 68:31 From Egypt nobles will come, Ethiopia will stretch out its hands to God.

Psa 68:32 Kingdoms of the earth, sing to God, play for

Psa 68:33 the Rider of the Heavens, the primeval heavens. Pause There he speaks, with a voice of power!

Psa 68:34 Acknowledge the power of God. Over Israel his splendour, in the clouds his power.

Psa 68:35 Awesome is God in his sanctuary. He, the God of Israel, gives strength and power to his people.
Blessed be God.

<h4>Lament</h4>

<p><em>For the choirmaster   Tune: “Lilies…”   Of David</em></p>

<p>Save me, God, for the waters <br />
  have closed in on my very being. </p>

<p>I am sinking in the deepest swamp <br />
  and there is no firm ground.</p>

<p>I have stepped into deep water <br />
  and the waves are washing over me. </p>

<p>I am exhausted with calling out, my throat is hoarse, <br />
  my eyes are worn out with searching for my God.</p>

<p>More numerous than the hairs of my head <br />
  are those who hate me without reason. <br />
Those who seek to get rid of me are powerful, <br />
  my treacherous enemies. <br />
(Must I give back what I have never stolen?) </p>

<p>God, you know how foolish I am, <br />
  my offences are not hidden from you.</p>

<p>Those who hope in you must not be made fools of, <br />
  Yahweh Sabaoth, because of me!</p> 

<p>Those who seek you must not be disgraced, <br />
  God of Israel, because of me! </p>

<p>It is for you I bear insults, <br />
  my face is covered with shame,<br />
I am estranged from my brothers, <br />
  alienated from my own mother’s sons; <br />
for I am eaten up with zeal for your house, <br />
  and insults directed against you fall on me. </p>

<p>I mortify myself with fasting, <br />
  and find myself insulted for it, <br />
I dress myself in sackcloth <br />
  and become their laughing-stock, <br />
the gossip of people sitting at the gate, <br />
  and the theme of drunkards’ songs. </p>

<p>And so, I pray to you, Yahweh, <br />
  at the time of your favour; <br />
in your faithful love answer me, <br />
  in the constancy of your saving power. </p>

<p>Rescue me from the mire before I sink in; <br />
  so I shall be saved from those who hate me, <br />
  from the watery depths. <br />
Let not the waves wash over me, <br />
  nor the deep swallow me up, <br />
nor the pit close its mouth on me. </p>

<p>Answer me, Yahweh, for your faithful love is generous; <br />
in your tenderness turn towards me; <br />
do not turn away from your servant, <br />
be quick to answer me, for I am in trouble. <br />
Come to my side, redeem me, <br />
ransom me because of my enemies. </p>

<p>You know well the insults, <br />
the shame and disgrace I endure. <br />
Every one of my oppressors is known to you. <br />
Insult has broken my heart past cure. <br />
I hoped for sympathy, but in vain, <br />
for consolers — not one to be found. </p>

<p>To eat they gave me poison, <br />
to drink, vinegar when I was thirsty. <br />
May their own table prove a trap for them, <br />
and their abundance a snare; <br />
may their eyes grow so dim that they cannot see, <br />
all their muscles lose their strength. </p>

<p>Vent your fury on them, <br />
let your burning anger overtake them. <br />
Reduce their encampment to ruin, <br />
and leave their tents untenanted, <br />
for hounding someöne you had already stricken, <br />
for redoubling the pain of one you had wounded. </p>

<p>Charge them with crime after crime, <br />
exclude them from your saving justice, <br />
erase them from the book of life, <br />
do not enrol them among the upright. </p>

<p>For myself, wounded wretch that I am, <br />
by your saving power raise me up! <br />
I will praise God’s name in song, <br />
I will extol him by thanksgiving, <br />
for this will please Yahweh more than an ox, <br />
than a bullock horned and hoofed. </p>

<p>The humble have seen and are glad. <br />
Let your courage revive, you who seek God. <br />
For God listens to the poor, <br />
he has never scorned his captive people. <br />
Let heaven and earth and seas, <br />
and all that stirs in them, acclaim him! </p>

<p>For God will save Zion, <br />
and rebuild the cities of Judah, <br />
and people will live there on their own land; <br />
the descendants of his servants will inherit it, <br />
and those who love his name will dwell there. </p>

Psa 70:1 [For the choirmaster Of David In commemoration] Be pleased, God, to rescue me, Yahweh, come
quickly and help me!

Psa 70:2 Shame and dismay to those who seek my life! Back with them! Let them be humiliated who delight in
my misfortunes.

Psa 70:3 Let them shrink away covered with shame, those who say to me, “Aha, aha!”.

Psa 70:4 But joy and happiness in you to all who seek you. Let them ceaselessly cry, “God is great”, who love
your saving power.

Psa 70:5 Poor and needy as I am, God, come quickly to me! Yahweh, my helper, my Saviour, do not delay!

Psa 71:1 In you, Yahweh, I take refuge, I shall never be put to shame.



Psa 71:2 In your saving justice rescue me, deliver me, listen to me and save me.

Psa 71:3 Be a sheltering rock for me, always accessible; you have determined to save me, for you are my rock,
my fortress.

Psa 71 :4 My God, rescue me from the clutches of the wicked, from the grasp of the rogue and the ruthless.

Psa 71:5 For you are my hope, Lord, my trust, Yahweh, since boyhood.

Psa 71:6 On you I have relied since my birth, since my mother’s womb you have been my portion, the constant
theme of my praise.

Psa 71:7 Many were bewildered at me, but you are my sure refuge.

Psa 71:8 My mouth is full of your praises, filled with your splendour all day long.

Psa 71:9 Do not reject me in my old age, nor desert me when my strength is failing,

Psa 71:10 for my enemies are discussing me, those with designs on my life are plotting together.

Psa 71:11 “Hound him down, for God has deserted him! Seize him, there is no one to rescue him”.

Psa 71:12 God, do not stand aloof, my God, come quickly to help me.

Psa 71:13 Shame and ruin on those who slander me, may those intent on harming me be covered with insult
and infamy.

Psa 71:14 As for me, my hope will never fade, I will praise you more and more.

Psa 71:15 My lips shall proclaim your saving justice, your saving power all day long.

Psa 71:16 I will come in the power of Yahweh to tell of your justice, yours alone.

Psa 71:17 God, you have taught me from boyhood, and I am still proclaiming your marvels.

Psa 71:18 Now that I am old and grey-haired, God, do not desert me, till I have proclaimed your strength to
generations still to come, your power

Psa 71:19 and justice to the skies. You have done great things, God, who is like you?

Psa 71 :20 You have shown me much misery and hardship, but you will give me life again, You will raise me up
again from the depths of the earth,

Psa 71 :21 prolong my old age, and comfort me again.

Psa 71 :22 For my part, I will thank you on the lyre for your constancy, my God. I will play the harp in your
honour, Holy One of Israel.

Psa 71:23 My lips sing for joy as I play to you, because you have redeemed me,

Psa 71 :24 and all day long my tongue muses on your saving justice. Shame and disgrace on those intent to
harm me!

Psa 72:1 [Of Solomon] God, endow the king with your own fair judgement, the son of the king with your own
saving justice,

Psa 72:2 that he may rule your people with justice, and your poor with fair judgement.

Psa 72:3 Mountains and hills, bring peace to the people! With justice

Psa 72:4 he will judge the poor of the people, he will save the children of the needy and crush their oppressors.
Psa 72:5 In the sight of the sun and the moon he will endure, age after age.

Psa 72:6 He will come down like rain on mown grass, like showers moistening the land.

Psa 72:7 In his days uprightness shall flourish, and peace in plenty till the moon is no more.

Psa 72:8 His empire shall stretch from sea to sea, from the river to the limits of the earth.

Psa 72:9 The Beast will cower before him, his enemies lick the dust;

Psa 72:10 the kings of Tarshish and the islands will pay him tribute. The kings of Sheba and Saba will offer gifts;
Psa 72:1 1 all kings will do him homage, all nations become his servants.

Psa 72:12 For he rescues the needy who calls to him, and the poor who has no one to help.

Psa 72:13 He has pity on the weak and the needy, and saves the needy from death.

Psa 72:14 From oppression and violence he redeems their lives, their blood is precious in his sight.

Psa 72:15 (Long may he live; may the gold of Sheba be given him!) Prayer will be offered for him constantly,
and blessings invoked on him all day.

Psa 72:16 May wheat abound in the land, waving on the heights of the hills, like Lebanon with its fruits and
flowers at their best, like the grasses of the earth.

Psa 72:17 May his name be blessed for ever, and endure in the sight of the sun. In him shall be blessed every
race in the world, and all nations call him blessed.

Psa 72:18 Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who alone works wonders;

Psa 72:19 blessed for ever his glorious name. May the whole world be filled with his glory! Amen! Amen!

Psa 72:20 End of the prayers of David, son of Jesse.

Psa 73:1 [Psalm Of Asaph] Indeed God is good to Israel, the Lord to those who are pure of heart.

Psa 73:2 My feet were on the point of stumbling, a little more and I had slipped,

Psa 73:3 envying the arrogant as I did, and seeing the prosperity of the wicked.

Psa 73:4 For them no such thing as pain, untroubled, their comfortable portliness;

Psa 73:5 exempt from the cares which are the human lot, they have no part in Adam’s afflictions.



Psa 73:6 So pride is a necklace to them, violence the garment they wear.

Psa 73:7 From their fat oozes out malice, their hearts drip with cunning.

Psa 73:8 Cynically they advocate evil, loftily they advocate force.

Psa 73:9 Their mouth claims heaven for themselves, and their tongue is never still on earth.

Psa 73:10 That is why my people turn to them, and enjoy the waters of plenty,

Psa 73:1 1 saying, “How can God know? What knowledge can the Most High have?”.

Psa 73:12 That is what the wicked are like, piling up wealth without any worries.

Psa 73:13 Was it useless, then, to have kept my own heart clean, to have washed my hands in innocence?

Psa 73:14 When I was under a hail of blows all day long, and punished every morning,

Psa 73:15 had I said, “I shall talk like them, 1 1 should have betrayed your children’s race.

Psa 73:16 So I set myself to understand this: how difficult I found it!

Psa 73:17 Until I went into the sanctuaries of the gods and understood what was destined to become of them.
Psa 73:18 You place them on a slippery slope and drive them down into chaos.

Psa 73:19 How sudden their hideous destruction! They are swept away, annihilated by terror!

Psa 73:20 Like a dream upon waking, Lord, when you awake, you dismiss their image.

Psa 73:21 My heart grew embittered, my affections dried up,

Psa 73:22 I was stupid and uncomprehending, a clumsy animal in your presence.

Psa 73:23 Even so, I stayed in your presence, you grasped me by the right hand;

Psa 73:24 you will guide me with advice, and will draw me in the wake of your glory.

Psa 73:25 Who else is there for me in heaven? And, with you, I lack nothing on earth.

Psa 73:26 My heart and my flesh are pining away: my heart’s rock, my portion, God for ever!

Psa 73:27 Truly, those who abandon you will perish; you destroy those who adulterously desert you,

Psa 73:28 whereäs my happiness is to be near God. I have made the Lord Yahweh my refuge, to tell of all your
works.

Psa 74:1 [Poem Of Asaph] God, why have you finally rejected us, your anger blazing against the flock you used
to pasture?

Psa 74:2 Remember the people you took to yourself long ago, your own tribe which you redeemed, and this
Mount Zion where you came to live.

Psa 74:3 Come up to these endless ruins! The enemy have sacked everything in the sanctuary;

Psa 74:4 your opponents made uproar in the place of assemblies, they fixed their emblems over the entrance,
emblems

Psa 74:5 never known before. Their axes deep in the wood,

Psa 74:6 hacking at the panels, they battered them down with axe and pick;

Psa 74:7 they set fire to your sanctuary, profanely rased to the ground the dwelling-place of your name.

Psa 74:8 They said to themselves, “Let us crush them at one stroke!”. They burned down every sacred shrine in
the land.

Psa 74:9 We see no signs, no prophet any more, and none of us knows how long it will last.

Psa 74:10 How much longer, God, will the enemy blaspheme? Is the enemy to insult your name for ever?

Psa 74:1 1 Why hold back your hand, keep your right hand hidden in the folds of your robe?

Psa 74:12 Yet, God, my king from the first, author of saving acts throughout the earth,

Psa 74: 1 3 by your power you split the sea in two, and smashed the heads of the monsters on the waters.

Psa 74:14 You crushed Leviathan’s heads, gave him as food to the wild animals.

Psa 74:15 You released the springs and brooks, and turned primordial rivers into dry land.

Psa 74:16 Yours is the day and yours the night, you caused sun and light to exist,

Psa 74:17 you fixed all the boundaries of the earth, you created summer and winter.

Psa 74:18 Remember, Yahweh, the enemy’s blasphemy, a foolish people insults your name.

Psa 74:19 Do not surrender your turtledove to the beast; do not forget for ever the life of your oppressed people.
Psa 74:20 Look to the covenant! All the hiding-places of the land are full, haunts of violence.

Psa 74:21 Do not let the downtrodden retreat in confusion, give the poor and needy cause to praise your name.
Psa 74:22 Arise, God, champion your own cause, remember how fools blaspheme you all day long!

Psa 74:23 Do not forget the shouting of your enemies, the ever-mounting uproar of your adversaries.

Psa 75:1 [For the choirmaster Tune: “Do not destroy” Psalm Of Asaph Song] We give thanks to you, God, we
give thanks to you, as we call upon your name, as we recount your wonders.

Psa 75:2 “At the appointed time I myself shall dispense justice.

Psa 75:3 The earth quakes and all its inhabitants; it is I who hold its pillars firm. Pause
Psa 75:4 “I said to the boastful, ‘Do not boast!’. to the wicked, ‘Do not flaunt your strength!

Psa 75:5 Do not flaunt your strength so proudly, do not talk with that arrogant stance’”.

Psa 75:6 No longer from east to west, no longer in the mountainous desert,

Psa 75:7 is God judging in uprightness, bringing some down, raising others.



Psa 75:8 Yahweh is holding a cup filled with a heady blend of wine; he will pour it, they will drink it to the dregs,
all the wicked on earth will drink it.

Psa 75:9 But I shall speak out for ever, shall make music for the God of Jacob.

Psa 75:10 I shall break down all the strength of the wicked, and the strength of the upright will rise high.

Psa 76:1 [For the choirmaster For strings Psalm Of Asaph Song] God is acknowledged in Judah, his name is
great in Israel,

Psa 76:2 his tent is pitched in Salem, his dwelling is in Zion;

Psa 76:3 there he has broken the lightning-flashes of the bow, shield and sword and war.Pause
Psa 76:4 Radiant you are, and renowned for the mountains of booty

Psa 76:5 taken from them. Heroes are now sleeping their last sleep, the warriors’ arms have failed them;

Psa 76:6 at your reproof, God of Jacob, chariot and horse stand stunned.

Psa 76:7 You, you alone, strike terror! Who can hold his ground in your presence when your anger strikes?

Psa 76:8 From heaven your verdicts thunder, the earth is silent with dread

Psa 76:9 when God takes his stand to give judgement, to save all the humble of the earth. Pause

Psa 76:10 Human anger serves only to praise you, the survivors of your anger will huddle round you.

Psa 76:1 1 Make and fulfil your vows to Yahweh your God, let those who surround him make offerings to the
Awesome One.

Psa 76:12 He cuts short the breath of princes, strikes terror in earthly kings.

Psa 77:1 [For the choirmaster … Jeduthun Of Asaph Psalm] I cry to God in distress, I cry to God and he hears
me.

Psa 77:2 In the day of my distress I sought the Lord; all night I tirelessly stretched out my hands, my heart
refused to be consoled.

Psa 77:3 I sigh as I think of God, my spirit faints away as I ponder on him. Pause
Psa 77:4 You kept me from closing my eyes, I was too distraught to speak;

Psa 77:5 I thought of former times, years long past

Psa 77:6 I recalled; through the night I ponder in my heart, as I reflect, my spirit asks this question:

Psa 77:7 Is the Lord’s rejection final? Will he never show favour again?

Psa 77:8 Is his faithful love gone for ever? Has his Word come to an end for all time?

Psa 77:9 Does God forget to show mercy? In anger does he shut off his tenderness?Pause

Psa 77:10 And I said, “This is what wounds me, the right hand of the Most High has lost its strength”.

Psa 77:1 1 Remembering Yahweh’s great deeds, remembering your wonders in the past,

Psa 77:12 I reflect on all that you did, I ponder all your great deeds.

Psa 77:13 God, your ways are holy! What god is as great as our God?

Psa 77:14 You are the God who does marvellous deeds, brought nations to acknowledge your power,

Psa 77:15 with your own arm redeeming your people, the children of Jacob and Joseph. Pause

Psa 77:16 When the waters saw you, God, when the waters saw you they writhed in anguish, the very depths

shook with fear.

Psa 77:17 The clouds pelted down water, the sky thundered, your arrows shot back and forth.

Psa 77:18 The rolling of your thunder was heard, your lightning-flashes lit up the world, the earth shuddered and
shook.

Psa 77:19 Your way led over the sea, your path over the countless waters, and none could trace your footsteps.
Psa 77:20 You guided your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

Psa 78:1 [Psalm Of Asaph] My people, listen to my teaching, pay attention to what I say.

Psa 78:2 I will speak to you in poetry, unfold the mysteries of the past.

Psa 78:3 What we have heard and know, what our ancestors have told us

Psa 78:4 we shall not conceal from their descendants, but will tell to a generation still to come: the praises of
Yahweh, his power, the wonderful deeds he has done.

Psa 78:5 He instituted a witness in Jacob, he established a law in Israel, he commanded our ancestors to hand
it down to their descendants,

Psa 78:6 that a generation still to come might know it, children yet to be born. They should be sure to tell their
own children,

Psa 78:7 and should put their trust in God, never forgetting God’s great deeds, always keeping his commands,
Psa 78:8 and not, like their ancestors, be a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation weak of purpose,
their spirit fickle towards God.

Psa 78:9 The archer sons of Ephraim turned tail when the time came for fighting;

Psa 78:10 they failed to keep God’s covenant, they refused to follow his Law;

Psa 78:1 1 they had forgotten his great deeds, the marvels he had shown them;

Psa 78:12 he did marvels in the sight of their ancestors in Egypt, in the plains of Tanis.

Psa 78:13 He split the sea and brought them through, made the waters stand up like a dam;



Psa 78:14 he led them with a cloud by day, and all the night with the light of a fire;

Psa 78:15 he split rocks in the desert, let them drink as though from the limitless depths;

Psa 78:16 he brought forth streams from a rock, made waters flow down in torrents.

Psa 78:17 But they only sinned against him more than ever, defying the Most High in barren country;

Psa 78:18 they deliberately challenged God by demanding food to their hearts’ content.

Psa 78:19 They insulted God by saying, “Can God make a banquet in the desert?

Psa 78:20 True, when he struck the rock, waters gushed out and flowed in torrents; but what of bread? Can he
give that, can he provide meat for his people?”.

Psa 78:21 When he heard them Yahweh vented his anger, fire blazed against Jacob, his anger mounted
against Israel,

Psa 78:22 because they had no faith in God, no trust in his power to save.

Psa 78:23 Even so he gave orders to the skies above, he opened the sluice-gates of heaven;

Psa 78:24 he rained down manna to feed them, he gave them the wheat of heaven;

Psa 78:25 mere mortals ate the bread of the Mighty, he sent them as much food as they could want.

Psa 78:26 He roused an east wind in the heavens, despatched a south wind by his strength;

Psa 78:27 he rained down meat on them like dust, birds thick as sand on the seashore,

Psa 78:28 tumbling into the middle of his camp, all around his dwelling-place.

Psa 78:29 They ate as much food as they wanted, he satisfied all their cravings;

Psa 78:30 but their cravings were still upon them, the food was still in their mouths,

Psa 78:31 when the wrath of God attacked them, slaughtering their strongest men, laying low the flower of
Israel.

Psa 78:32 Despite all this, they went on sinning, they put no faith in his marvels.

Psa 78:33 He made their days vanish in mist, their years in sudden ruin.

Psa 78:34 Whenever he slaughtered them, they began to seek him, they turned back and looked eagerly for
him,

Psa 78:35 recalling that God was their rock, God the Most High, their redeemer.

Psa 78:36 They tried to hoodwink him with their mouths, their tongues were deceitful towards him;

Psa 78:37 their hearts were not loyal to him, they were not faithful to his covenant.

Psa 78:38 But in his compassion he forgave their guilt instead of killing them, time and again repressing his
anger instead of rousing his full wrath,

Psa 78:39 remembering they were creatures of flesh, a breath of wind that passes, never to return.

Psa 78:40 How often they defied him in the desert! How often they grieved him in the wastelands!

Psa 78:41 Repeatedly they challenged God, provoking the Holy One of Israel,

Psa 78:42 not remembering his hand, the time when he saved them from the oppressor,

Psa 78:43 he who did his signs in Egypt, his miracles in the plains of Tanis,

Psa 78:44 turning their rivers to blood, their streams so that they had nothing to drink.

Psa 78:45 He sent horseflies to eat them up, and frogs to devastate them,

Psa 78:46 consigning their crops to the caterpillar, the fruit of their hard work to the locust;

Psa 78:47 he killed their vines with hail, their sycamore trees with frost,

Psa 78:48 delivering up their cattle to hail, and their flocks to thunderbolts.

Psa 78:49 He loosed against them the full heat of his anger, fury, rage and destruction, a detachment of
destroying angels;

Psa 78:50 he gave free course to his anger. He did not exempt their own selves from death, delivering up their
lives to the plague.

Psa 78:51 He struck all the first-born in Egypt, the flower of the youth in the tents of Ham.

Psa 78:52 He brought out his people like sheep, guiding them like a flock in the desert,

Psa 78:53 leading them safe and unafraid, while the sea engulfed their enemies.

Psa 78:54 He brought them to his holy land, the hill-country won by his right hand;

Psa 78:55 he dispossessed nations before them, measured out a heritage for each of them, and settled the
tribes of Israel in their tents.

Psa 78:56 But still they challenged the Most High God and defied him, refusing to keep his decrees;

Psa 78:57 as perverse and treacherous as their ancestors, they gave way like a faulty bow,

Psa 78:58 provoking him with their high places, rousing his jealousy with their idols.

Psa 78:59 God listened and vented his wrath, he totally rejected Israel;

Psa 78:60 he forsook his dwelling in Shiloh, the tent where he used to dwell on the earth.

Psa 78:61 He abandoned his power to captivity, his splendour to the enemy’s clutches;

Psa 78:62 he gave up his people to the sword, he vented his wrath on his own heritage.

Psa 78:63 Fire devoured their young men, their young girls had no wedding-song;

Psa 78:64 their priests fell by the sword and their widows sang no dirge.



Psa 78:65 The Lord arose as though he had been asleep, like a strong man fighting-mad with wine,

Psa 78:66 he struck his enemies on the rump, and put them to everlasting shame.

Psa 78:67 Rejecting the tents of Joseph, passing over the tribe of Ephraim,

Psa 78:68 he chose the tribe of Judah, his well-loved mountain of Zion;

Psa 78:69 he built his sanctuary like high hills, like the earth set it firm for ever.

Psa 78:70 He chose David to be his servant, took him from the sheepfold,

Psa 78:71 took him from tending ewes to pasture his servant Jacob, and Israel his heritage.

Psa 78:72 He pastured them with unblemished heart, with a sensitive hand he led them.

Psa 79:1 [Psalm Of Asaph] God, the pagans have invaded your heritage, they have defiled your holy temple,
they have laid Jerusalem in ruins,

Psa 79:2 they have left the corpses of your servants as food for the birds of the air, the bodies of your faithful for
the wild beasts.

Psa 79:3 Around Jerusalem they have shed blood like water, leaving no one to bury them.

Psa 79:4 We are the scorn of our neighbours, the butt and laughing-stock of those around us.

Psa 79:5 How long will you be angry, Yahweh? For ever? Is your jealousy to go on smouldering like a fire?

Psa 79:6 Pour out your anger on the nations who do not acknowledge you, and on the kingdoms that do not call
on your name;

Psa 79:7 for they have devoured Jacob and devastated his home.

Psa 79:8 Do not count against us the guilt of former generations, in your tenderness come quickly to meet us,
for we are utterly weakened;

Psa 79:9 help us, God our Saviour, for the glory of your name; Yahweh, wipe away our sins, rescue us for the
sake of your name.

Psa 79:10 Why should the nations ask, “Where is their God?”. Let us see the nations suffer vengeance for
shedding your servants’ blood.

Psa 79:1 1 May the groans of the captive reach you, by your great strength save those who are condemned to
death!

Psa 79:12 Repay our neighbours sevenfold for the insults they have levelled at you, Lord.

Psa 79:13 And we, your people, the flock that you pasture, will thank you for ever, will recite your praises from
age to age.

Psa 80:1 [For the choirmaster Tune: “The decrees are lilies’ Of Asaph Psalm] Shepherd of Israel, listen, you who

lead Joseph like a flock, enthroned on the winged creatures, shine forth

Psa 80:2 over Ephraim, Benjamin and Manasseh; rouse your valour and come to our help.

Psa 80:3 God, bring us back, let your face shine on us and we shall be safe.

Psa 80:4 Yahweh, God Sabaoth, how long will you flare up at your people’s prayer?

Psa 80:5 You have made tears their food, redoubled tears their drink.

Psa 80:6 You let our neighbours quarrel over us, our enemies mock us.

Psa 80:7 God Sabaoth, bring us back, let your face shine on us and we shall be safe.

Psa 80:8 You brought a vine out of Egypt, to plant it you drove out nations;

Psa 80:9 you cleared a space for it, it took root and filled the whole country.

Psa 80:10 The mountains were covered with its shade, and the cedars of God with its branches,

Psa 80:1 1 its boughs stretched as far as the sea, its shoots as far as the River.

Psa 80:12 Why have you broken down its fences? Every passer-by plucks its grapes,

Psa 80:13 boars from the forest tear at it, wild beasts feed on it.

Psa 80:14 God Sabaoth, come back, we pray, look down from heaven and see, visit this vine;

Psa 80:15 protect what your own hand has planted.

Psa 80:16 They have thrown it on the fire like dung, the frown of your rebuke will destroy them.

Psa 80:17 May your hand protect those at your side, the child of Adam you have strengthened for yourself!

Psa 80:18 Never again will we turn away from you, give us life and we will call upon your name.

Psa 80:19 God Sabaoth, bring us back, let your face shine on us and we shall be safe.

Psa 81:1 [For the choirmaster On the … of Gath Of Asaph] Sing for joy to God our strength, shout in triumph to
the God of Jacob.

Psa 81 :2 Strike up the music, beat the tambourine, play the melodious harp and the lyre;

Psa 81 :3 blow the trumpet for the new month, for the full moon, for our feast day!

Psa 81 :4 For Israel has this statute, a decision of the God of Jacob,

Psa 81 :5 a decree he imposed on Joseph, when he went to war against Egypt. I heard a voice unknown to me,
Psa 81 :6 “I freed his shoulder from the burden, his hands were able to lay aside the labourer’s basket.

Psa 81:7 You cried out in your distress, so I rescued you. “Hidden in the storm, I answered you, I tested you at
the waters of Meribah. Pause

Psa 81 :8 Listen, my people, while I give you warning; Israel, if only you would listen to me!



Psa 81 :9 “You shall have no strange gods, shall worship no alien god.

Psa 81:10 I, Yahweh, am your God, who brought you here from Egypt, you have only to open your mouth for
me to fill it.

Psa 81:11 “My people would not listen to me, Israel would have none of me.

Psa 81:12 Sol left them to their stubborn selves, to follow their own devices.

Psa 81:13 “If only my people would listen to me, if only Israel would walk in my ways,

Psa 81:14 at one stroke I would subdue their enemies, turn my hand against their opponents.

Psa 81:15 “Those who hate Yahweh would woo his favour, though their doom was sealed for ever,

Psa 81:16 while I would feed him on pure wheat, would give you your fill of honey from the rock”.

Psa 82:1 [Psalm Of Asaph] God takes his stand in the divine assembly, surrounded by the gods he gives
judgement.

Psa 82:2 “How much longer will you give unjust judgements and uphold the prestige of the wicked?

Psa 82:3 Let the weak and the orphan have justice, be fair to the wretched and the destitute. Pause
Psa 82:4 “Rescue the weak and the needy, save them from the clutches of the wicked.

Psa 82:5 “Ignorant and uncomprehending, they wander in darkness, while the foundations of the world are
tottering.

Psa 82:6 I had thought, ‘Are you gods, are all of you sons of the Most High?’.

Psa 82:7 No! you will die as human beings do, as one man, princes, you will fall”.

Psa 82:8 Arise, God, judge the world, for all nations belong to you.

Psa 83:1 [Song Psalm Of Asaph] God, do not remain silent, do not stay quiet or unmoved, God!

Psa 83:2 See how your enemies are in uproar, how those who hate you are rearing their heads.

Psa 83:3 They are laying plans against your people, conspiring against those you cherish;

Psa 83:4 they say, “Come, let us annihilate them as a nation, the name of Israel shall be remembered no more!”.
Psa 83:5 They conspire with a single mind, they conclude an alliance against you,

Psa 83:6 the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagrites,

Psa 83:7 Gebal, Ammon, Amalek, Philistia and the Tyrians;

Psa 83:8 even Assyria has joined them to reinforce the children of Lot.Pause
Psa 83:9 Treat them like Midian and Sisera, like Jabin at the river Kishon;

Psa 83:10 wiped out at En-Dor, they served to manure the ground.

Psa 83:1 1 Treat their leaders like Oreb and Zeeb, all their commanders like Zebah and Zalmunna,

Psa 83:12 for they said, “Let us take for ourselves God’s settlements”.

Psa 83:13 My God, treat them like thistledown, like chaff at the mercy of the wind.

Psa 83:14 As fire devours a forest, as a flame sets mountains ablaze,

Psa 83:15 so drive them away with your tempest, by your whirlwind fill them with terror.

Psa 83:16 Shame written all over their faces, let them seek your name, Yahweh!

Psa 83:17 Dishonour and terror be always theirs, death also and destruction.

Psa 83:18 Let them know that you alone bear the name of Yahweh, Most High overall the earth.

Psa 84:1 [For the choirmaster On the … of Gath Of the sons of Korah Psalm] How lovely are your dwelling-
places, Yahweh Sabaoth.

Psa 84:2 My whole being yearns and pines for Yahweh’s courts, My heart and my body cry out for joy to the
living God.

Psa 84:3 Even the sparrow has found a home, the swallow a nest to place its young: your altars, Yahweh
Sabaoth, my King and my God.

Psa 84:4 How blessed are those who live in your house; they shall praise you continually. Pause
Psa 84:5 Blessed those who find their strength in you, whose hearts are set on pilgrimage.

Psa 84:6 As they pass through the Valley of the Balsam, they make there a water-hole, and — a further blessing
— early rain fills it.

Psa 84:7 They make their way from height to height, God shows himself to them in Zion.

Psa 84:8 Yahweh, God Sabaoth, hear my prayer, listen, God of Jacob.

Psa 84:9 God, our shield, look, and see the face of your anointed.

Psa 84:10 Better one day in your courts than a thousand at my own devices, to stand on the threshold of God’s
house than to live in the tents of the wicked.

Psa 84:1 1 For Yahweh God is a rampart and shield, he gives grace and glory; Yahweh refuses nothing good to
those whose life is blameless.

Psa 84:12 Yahweh Sabaoth, blessed is he who trusts in you.

Psa 85:1 [For the choirmaster Of the sons of Korah Psalm] Yahweh, you are gracious to your land, you bring
back the captives of Jacob,

Psa 85:2 you take away the guilt of your people, you blot out all their sin. Pause
Psa 85:3 You retract all your anger, you renounce the heat of your fury.



Psa 85:4 Bring us back, God our Saviour, appease your indignation against us!

Psa 85:5 Will you be angry with us for ever? Will you prolong your wrath age after age?

Psa 85:6 Will you not give us life again, for your people to rejoice in you?

Psa 85:7 Show us, Lord, your faithful love, grant us your saving help.

Psa 85:8 I am listening. What is God’s message? Yahweh’s message is peace for his people, for his faithful, if
only they renounce their folly.

Psa 85:9 His saving help is near for those who fear him, his glory will dwell in our land.

Psa 85:10 Faithful Love and Loyalty join together, Saving Justice and Peace embrace.

Psa 85:1 1 Loyalty will spring up from the earth, and Justice will lean down from heaven.

Psa 85:12 Yahweh will himself give prosperity, and our soil will yield its harvest.

Psa 85:13 Justice will walk before him, treading out a path.

Psa 87:1 [Of the sons of Korah Psalm Song] With its foundations on the holy mountains,

Psa 87:6 Yahweh in his register of peoples will note against each, “Born there”, Pause
Psa 87:7 princes no less than native-born; all make their home in you.

Psa 88:1 [Song Psalm Of the sons of Korah In sickness In suffering Poem For Heman the native-born] Yahweh,
God of my salvation, when I cry out to you in the night,

Psa 88:2 may my prayer reach your presence, hear my cry for help.

Psa 88:3 For I am filled with misery, my life is on the brink of Sheol;

Psa 88:4 already numbered among those who sink into oblivion, I am as one bereft of strength,

Psa 88:5 left alone among the dead, like the slaughtered lying in the grave, whom you remember no more, cut
off as they are from your protection.

Psa 88:6 You have plunged me to the bottom of the grave, in the darkness, in the depths;

Psa 88:7 weighted down by your anger, kept low by your waves. Pause

Psa 88:8 You have deprived me of my friends, made me repulsive to them, imprisoned, with no escape;

Psa 88:9 my eyes are worn out with suffering. I call to you, Yahweh, all day, I stretch out my hands to you.

Psa 88:10 Do you work wonders for the dead, can shadows rise up to praise you?Pause

Psa 88:1 1 Do they speak in the grave of your faithful love, of your constancy in the place of perdition?

Psa 88:12 Are your wonders known in the darkness, your saving justice in the land of oblivion?

Psa 88:13 But, for my part, I cry to you, Yahweh, every morning my prayer comes before you;

Psa 88:14 why, Yahweh, do you rebuff me, turn your face away from me?

Psa 88:15 Wretched and close to death since childhood, I have borne your terrors — I am finished!

Psa 88:16 Your anger has overwhelmed me, your terrors annihilated me.

Psa 88:17 They flood around me all day long, close in on me all at once.



Psa 88:18 You have deprived me of friends and companions, and all that I know is the dark.

Psa 89:1 [Poem For Ethan the native-born] I shall sing the faithful love of Yahweh for ever, from age to age my
lips shall declare your constancy,

Psa 89:2 for you have said: love is built to last for ever, you have fixed your constancy firm in the heavens.

Psa 89:3 “I have made a covenant with my Chosen One, sworn an oath to my servant David:

Psa 89:4 I have made your dynasty firm for ever, built your throne stable age after age. “Pause
Psa 89:5 The heavens praise your wonders, Yahweh, your constancy in the gathering of your faithful.

Psa 89:6 Who in the skies can compare with Yahweh? Who among the sons of god can rival him?

Psa 89:7 God, awesome in the assembly of holy ones, great and dreaded among all who surround him,

Psa 89:8 Yahweh, God Sabaoth, who is like you? Mighty Yahweh, your constancy is all round you!

Psa 89:9 You control the pride of the ocean, when its waves ride high you calm them.

Psa 89:10 You split Rahab in two like a corpse, scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.

Psa 89:1 1 Yours are the heavens and yours the earth, the world and all it holds, you founded them;

Psa 89:12 you created the north and the south, Tabor and Hermon hail your name with joy.

Psa 89:13 Yours is a strong arm, mighty your hand, your right hand raised high;

Psa 89:14 Saving Justice and Fair Judgement the foundations of your throne, Faithful Love and Constancy
march before you.

Psa 89:15 How blessed the nation that learns to acclaim you! They will live, Yahweh, in the light of your
presence.

Psa 89:16 In your name they rejoice all day long, by your saving justice they are raised up.

Psa 89:17 You are the flower of their strength, by your favour our strength is triumphant;

Psa 89:18 for to Yahweh belongs our shield, to the Holy One of Israel our king.

Psa 89:19 Once you spoke in a vision, to your faithful you said: “I have given strength to a warrior, I have raised
up a man chosen from my people.

Psa 89:20 “I have found David my servant, and anointed him with my holy oil.

Psa 89:21 My hand will always be with him, my arm will make him strong.

Psa 89:22 “No enemy will be able to outwit him, no wicked man overcome him;

Psa 89:23 I shall crush his enemies before him, strike his opponents dead.

Psa 89:24 “My constancy and faithful love will be with him, in my name his strength will be triumphant.

Psa 89:25 I shall establish his power over the sea, his dominion over the rivers.

Psa 89:26 “He will cry to me, ‘You are my father, my God, the rock of my salvation!’.

Psa 89:27 So I shall make him my first-born, the highest of earthly kings.

Psa 89:28 “I shall maintain my faithful love for him always, my covenant with him will stay firm.

Psa 89:29 I have established his dynasty for ever, his throne to be as lasting as the heavens.

Psa 89:30 “Should his descendants desert my law, and not keep to my rulings,

Psa 89:31 should they violate my statutes, and not observe my commandments,

Psa 89:32 “then I shall punish their offences with the rod, their guilt with the whip,

Psa 89:33 but I shall never withdraw from him my faithful love, I shall not belie my constancy.

Psa 89:34 “I shall not violate my covenant, I shall not withdraw the word once spoken.

Psa 89:35 I have sworn by my holiness, once and for all, never will I break faith with David.

Psa 89:36 “His dynasty shall endure for ever, his throne like the sun before me,

Psa 89:37 as the moon is established for ever, a faithful witness in the skies. “Pause

Psa 89:38 Yet you yourself— you have spurned and rejected, and have vented your wrath on your anointed,
Psa 89:39 you have repudiated the covenant with your servant, dishonoured his crown in the dust.

Psa 89:40 You have pierced all his defences, and laid his strongholds in ruins,

Psa 89:41 everyone passing by plunders him, he has become the butt of his neighbours.

Psa 89:42 You have raised high the right hand of his opponents, have made all his enemies happy;

Psa 89:43 you have snapped off his sword on a rock, and failed to support him in battle.

Psa 89:44 You have stripped him of his splendid sceptre, and toppled his throne to the ground.

Psa 89:45 You have aged him before his time, enveloped him in shame. Pause

Psa 89:46 How long, Yahweh, will you remain hidden? For ever? Is your anger to go on smouldering like a fire?
Psa 89:47 Remember me; how long have I left? For what pointless end did you create all the children of Adam?
Psa 89:48 Who can live and never see death? Who can save himself from the clutches of Sheol?Pause
Psa 89:49 Lord, what of those pledges of your faithful love? You made an oath to David by your constancy.

Psa 89:50 Do not forget the insults to your servant; I take to heart the taunts of the nations,

Psa 89:51 which your enemies have levelled, Yahweh, have levelled at the footsteps of your anointed!

Psa 89:52 Blessed be Yahweh for ever. Amen, Amen.

<h4>On human frailty</h4>

<p><em>Prayer   Of Moses, man of God</em></p>

<p>
Lord, you have been our refuge <br />
from age to age.
</p>
<p>
Before the mountains were born, <br />
before the earth and the world came to birth, <br />
from eternity to eternity you are God.
</p>
<p>
You bring human beings to the dust, <br />
by saying, “Return, children of Adam”. <br />
A thousand years are to you <br />
like a yesterday which has passed, <br />
like a watch of the night.
</p>
<p>
You flood them with sleep <br />
— in the morning they will be like growing grass: <br />
in the morning it is blossoming and growing, <br />
by evening it is withered and dry.
</p>
<p>
For we have been destroyed by your wrath, <br />
dismayed by your anger. <br />
You have taken note of our guilty deeds, <br />
our secrets in the full light of your presence.
</p>
<p>
All our days pass under your wrath, <br />
our lives are over like a sigh. <br />
The span of our life is seventy years — <br />
eighty for those who are strong — <br />
but their whole extent is anxiety and trouble, <br />
they are over in a moment and we are gone.
</p>
<p>
Who feels the power of your anger, <br />
or who that fears you, your wrath?
</p>
<p>
Teach us to count up the days that are ours, <br />
and we shall come to the heart of wisdom. <br />
Come back, Yahweh! How long must we wait? <br />
Take pity on your servants.
</p>
<p>
Each morning fill us with your faithful love, <br />
we shall sing and be happy all our days; <br />
let our joy be as long as the time that you afflicted us, <br />
the years when we experienced disaster.
</p>
<p>
Show your servants the deeds you do, <br />
let their children enjoy your splendour! <br />
May the sweetness of the Lord be upon us, <br />
to confirm the work we have done!

Psa 91:1 You who live in the secret place of Elyon, spend your nights in the shelter of Shaddai,

Psa 91:2 saying to Yahweh, “My refuge, my fortress, my God in whom I trust!”.

Psa 91 :3 Fie rescues you from the snare of the fowler set on destruction;

Psa 91 :4 he covers you with his pinions, you find shelter under his wings. His constancy is shield and
protection.

Psa 91 :5 You need not fear the terrors of night, the arrow that flies in the daytime,

Psa 91 :6 the plague that stalks in the darkness, the scourge that wreaks havoc at high noon.

Psa 91 :7 Though a thousand fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, you yourself will remain
unscathed.

Psa 91 :8 You have only to keep your eyes open to see how the wicked are repaid,

Psa 91 :9 you who say, “Yahweh my refuge!”. and make Elyon your fortress.

Psa 91:10 No disaster can overtake you, no plague come near your tent;

Psa 91:11 he has given his angels orders about you to guard you wherever you go.

Psa 91:12 They will carry you in their arms in case you trip over a stone.

Psa 91:13 You will walk upon wild beast and adder, you will trample young lions and snakes.

Psa 91:14 “Since he clings to me I rescue him, I raise him high, since he acknowledges my name.

Psa 91:15 He calls to me and I answer him: in distress I am at his side, I rescue him and bring him honour.

Psa 91:16 I shall satisfy him with long life, and grant him to see my salvation”.

Psa 92:1 [Psalm Song For the Sabbath] It is good to give thanks to Yahweh, to make music for your name, Most
High,

Psa 92:2 to proclaim your faithful love at daybreak, and your constancy all through the night,

Psa 92:3 on the lyre, the ten-stringed lyre, to the murmur of the harp.

Psa 92:4 You have brought me joy, Yahweh, by your deeds, at the work of your hands I cry out,

Psa 92:5 “How great are your works, Yahweh, immensely deep your thoughts!”.

Psa 92:6 Stupid people cannot realise this, fools do not grasp it.

Psa 92:7 The wicked may sprout like weeds, and every evil-doer flourish, but only to be eternally destroyed;

Psa 92:8 whereäs you are supreme for ever, Yahweh.

Psa 92:9 Look how your enemies perish, how all evil-doers are scattered!

Psa 92:10 You give me the strength of the wild ox, you anoint me with fresh oil;

Psa 92:1 1 I caught sight of the ambush against me, overheard the plans of the wicked.

Psa 92:12 The upright will flourish like the palm tree, will grow like a cedar of Lebanon.

Psa 92:13 Planted in the house of Yahweh, they will flourish in the courts of our God.

Psa 92:14 In old age they will still bear fruit, will remain fresh and green,

Psa 92:15 to proclaim Yahweh’s integrity; my rock, in whom no fault can be found.

Psa 93:1 Yahweh is king, robed in majesty, robed is Yahweh and girded with power.

Psa 93:2 The world is indeed set firm, it can never be shaken; your throne is set firm from of old, from all
eternity you exist.

Psa 93:3 The rivers lift up, Yahweh, the rivers lift up their voices, the rivers lift up their thunder.

Psa 93:4 Greater than the voice of many waters, more majestic than the breakers of the sea, Yahweh is
majestic in the heights.

Psa 93:5 Your decrees stand firm, unshakeable, holiness is the beauty of your house, Yahweh, for all time to
come.



Psa 94:1 God of vengeance, Yahweh, God of vengeance, shine forth!

Psa 94:2 Arise, judge of the world, give back the proud what they deserve!

Psa 94:3 How long are the wicked, Yahweh, how long are the wicked to triumph?

Psa 94:4 They bluster and boast, they flaunt themselves, all the evil-doers.

Psa 94:5 They crush your people, Yahweh, they oppress your heritage,

Psa 94:6 they murder the widow and the stranger, bring the orphan to a violent death.

Psa 94:7 They say, “Yahweh is not looking, the God of Jacob is taking no notice”.

Psa 94:8 Take notice yourselves, you coarsest of people! Fools, when will you learn some sense?

Psa 94:9 Shall he who implanted the ear not hear, he who fashioned the eye not see?

Psa 94:10 Shall he who instructs nations not punish? Yahweh, the teacher of all people,

Psa 94:1 1 knows human plans and how insipid they are.

Psa 94:12 How blessed are those you instruct, Yahweh, whom you teach by means of your law,

Psa 94:13 to give them respite in evil times, till a pit is dug for the wicked.

Psa 94:14 Yahweh will not abandon his people, he will not desert his heritage;

Psa 94: 1 5 for judgement will again become saving justice, and in its wake all upright hearts will follow.

Psa 94:16 Who rises up on my side against the wicked? Who stands firm on my side against all evil-doers?

Psa 94: 1 7 If Yahweh did not come to my help, I should soon find myself dwelling in the silence.

Psa 94:18 I need only say, “I am slipping”, for your faithful love, Yahweh, to support me;

Psa 94: 1 9 however great the anxiety of my heart, your consolations soothe me.

Psa 94:20 Are you partner to a destructive court, that gives disorder the status of law?

Psa 94:21 They make an attack on the life of the upright, and condemn innocent blood.

Psa 94:22 No! Yahweh is a stronghold to me, my God is my rock of refuge.

Psa 94:23 He turns back their guilt on themselves, annihilates them for their wickedness, he annihilates them,
Yahweh our God.

Psa 95:1 Come, let us cry out with joy to Yahweh, acclaim the rock of our salvation.

Psa 95:2 Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving, acclaim him with music.

Psa 95:3 For Yahweh is a great God, a king greater than all the gods.

Psa 95:4 In his power are the depths of the earth, the peaks of the mountains are his;

Psa 95:5 the sea belongs to him, for he made it, and the dry land, moulded by his hands.

Psa 95:6 Come, let us bow low and do reverence; kneel before Yahweh who made us!

Psa 95:7 For he is our God, and we the people of his sheepfold, the flock of his hand. If only you would listen to
him today!

Psa 95:8 Do not harden your hearts as at Meribah, as at the time of Massah in the desert,

Psa 95:9 when your ancestors challenged me, put me to the test, and saw what I could do!

Psa 95:10 For forty years that generation sickened me, and I said, “Always fickle hearts; they cannot grasp my
ways”.

Psa 95:1 1 Then in my anger I swore they would never enter my place of rest.

Psa 96:1 Sing a new song to Yahweh! Sing to Yahweh, all the earth!

Psa 96:2 Sing to Yahweh, bless his name! Proclaim his salvation day after day,

Psa 96:3 declare his glory among the nations, his marvels to every people!

Psa 96:4 Great is Yahweh, worthy of all praise, more awesome than any of the gods.

Psa 96:5 All the gods of the nations are idols! It was Yahweh who made the heavens;

Psa 96:6 in his presence are splendour and majesty, in his sanctuary power and beauty.

Psa 96:7 Give to Yahweh, families of nations, give to Yahweh glory and power,

Psa 96:8 give to Yahweh the glory due to his name! Bring an offering and enter his courts,

Psa 96:9 adore Yahweh in the splendour of his holiness. Tremble before him, all the earth.

Psa 96:10 Say among the nations, “Yahweh is king”. The world is set firm, it cannot be moved. He will judge the
nations with justice.

Psa 96:1 1 Let the heavens rejoice and earth be glad! Let the sea thunder, and all it holds!

Psa 96:12 Let the countryside exult, and all that is in it, and all the trees of the forest cry out for joy,

Psa 96:13 at Yahweh’s approach, for he is coming, coming to judge the earth; he will judge the world with
saving justice, and the nations with constancy.

Psa 97:1 Yahweh is king! Let earth rejoice, the many isles be glad!

Psa 97:2 Cloud, black cloud enfolds him, saving justice and judgement the foundations of his throne.

Psa 97:3 Fire goes before him, sets ablaze his enemies all around;

Psa 97:4 his lightning-flashes light up the world, the earth sees it and quakes.

Psa 97:5 The mountains melt like wax, before the Lord of all the earth.

Psa 97:6 The heavens proclaim his saving justice, all nations see his glory.

Psa 97:7 Shame on all who serve images, who pride themselves on their idols; bow down to him, all you gods!



Psa 97:8 Zion hears and is glad, the daughters of Judah exult, because of your judgements, Yahweh.

Psa 97:9 For you are Yahweh, Most High over all the earth, far transcending all gods.

Psa 97:10 Yahweh loves those who hate evil, he keeps safe his faithful, rescues them from the clutches of the
wicked.

Psa 97:1 1 Light dawns for the upright, and joy for honest hearts.

Psa 97:12 Rejoice in Yahweh, you who are upright, praise his unforgettable holiness.

Psa 98:1 [Psalm] Sing a new song to Yahweh, for he has performed wonders, his saving power is in his right
hand and his holy arm.

Psa 98:2 Yahweh has made known his saving power, revealed his saving justice for the nations to see,

Psa 98:3 mindful of his faithful love and his constancy to the Flouse of Israel. The whole wide world has seen
the saving power of our God.

Psa 98:4 Acclaim Yahweh, all the earth, burst into shouts of joy!

Psa 98:5 Play to Yahweh on the harp, to the sound of instruments;

Psa 98:6 to the sound of trumpet and horn, acclaim the presence of the King.

Psa 98:7 Let the sea thunder, and all that it holds, the world and all who live in it.

Psa 98:8 Let the rivers clap their hands, and the mountains shout for joy together,

Psa 98:9 at Yahweh’s approach, for he is coming to judge the earth; he will judge the world with saving justice
and the nations with fairness.

Psa 99:1 Yahweh is king, the peoples tremble; he is enthroned on the winged creatures, the earth shivers;

Psa 99:2 Yahweh is great in Zion. He is supreme over all nations;

Psa 99:3 let them praise your name, great and awesome; holy is he

Psa 99:4 and mighty! You are a king who loves justice, you established honesty, justice and uprightness; in
Jacob it is you who are active.

Psa 99:5 Exalt Yahweh our God, bow down at his footstool; holy is he!

Psa 99:6 Moses and Aaron are among his priests, and Samuel, calling on his name; they called on Yahweh and
he answered them.

Psa 99:7 He spoke with them in the pillar of fire, they obeyed his decrees, the Law he gave them.

Psa 99:8 Yahweh our God, you answered them, you were a God of forgiveness to them, but punished them for
their sins.

Psa 99:9 Exalt Yahweh our God, bow down at his holy mountain; holy is Yahweh our God!

Psa 100:1 [Psalm For thanksgiving] Acclaim Yahweh, all the earth,

Psa 100:2 serve Yahweh with gladness, come into his presence with songs of joy!

Psa 100:3 Be sure that Yahweh is God, he made us, we belong to him, his people, the flock of his sheepfold.
Psa 100:4 Come within his gates giving thanks, to his courts singing praise, give thanks to him and bless his
name!

Psa 1 00:5 For Yahweh is good, his faithful love is everlasting, his constancy from age to age.

Psa 101:1 [Of David Psalm] I will sing of faithful love and judgement; to you, Yahweh, will I make music.

Psa 101:2 I will go forward in the path of the blameless; when will you come to me? I will live in purity of heart, in
my house,

Psa 101:3 I will not set before my eyes anything sordid. I hate those who act crookedly; this has no attraction for
me.

Psa 101 :4 Let the perverse of heart keep away from me; the wicked I disregard.

Psa 101:5 One who secretly slanders a comrade, I reduce to silence; haughty looks, proud heart, these I cannot
abide.

Psa 101:6 I look to the faithful of the land to be my companions, only he who walks in the path of the blameless
shall be my servant.

Psa 1 01 :7 There is no room in my house for anyone who practises deceit; no liar will stand his ground where I
can see him.

Psa 101:8 Morning after morning I reduce to silence all the wicked in the land, banishing from the city of
Yahweh all evil-doers.

Psa 102:1 [Prayer of someöne afflicted, who in misfortune pours out sorrows before Yahweh] Yahweh, hear my
prayer, let my cry for help reach you.

Psa 102:2 Do not turn away your face from me when I am in trouble; bend down and listen to me, when I call,
be quick to answer me!

Psa 102:3 For my days are vanishing like smoke, my bones burning like an oven;

Psa 102:4 like grass struck by blight, my heart is withering, I forget to eat my meals.

Psa 1 02:5 From the effort of voicing my groans my bones stick out through my skin.

Psa 102:6 I am like a desert-owl in the wastes, a screech-owl among ruins,

Psa 102:7 I keep vigil and moan like a lone bird on a roof.



Psa 102:8 All day long my enemies taunt me, those who once praised me now use me as a curse.

Psa 102:9 Ashes are the food that I eat, my drink is mingled with tears,

Psa 102:10 because of your fury and anger, since you have raised me up only to cast me away;

Psa 102:11 my days are like a fading shadow, I am withering up like grass.

Psa 102:12 But you, Yahweh, are enthroned for ever, each generation in turn remembers you.

Psa 102:13 Rise up, take pity on Zion! the time has come to have mercy on her, the moment has come;

Psa 102:14 for your servants love her very stones, are moved to pity by her dust.

Psa 102:15 Then will the nations revere the name of Yahweh, and all the kings of the earth your glory;

Psa 102:16 when Yahweh builds Zion anew, he will be seen in his glory;

Psa 102:17 he will turn to hear the prayer of the destitute, and will not treat their prayer with scorn.

Psa 102:18 This shall be put on record for a future generation, and a people yet to be born shall praise God:

Psa 102:19 Yahweh has leaned down from the heights of his sanctuary, has looked down from heaven to earth,
Psa 1 02:20 to listen to the sighing of the captive, and set free those condemned to death,

Psa 102:21 to proclaim the name of Yahweh in Zion, his praise in Jerusalem;

Psa 102:22 nations will gather together, and kingdoms to worship Yahweh.

Psa 102:23 In my journeying my strength has failed on the way;

Psa 102:24 let me know the short time I have left. Do not take me away before half my days are done, for your
years run on from age to age.

Psa 102:25 Long ago you laid earth’s foundations, the heavens are the work of your hands.

Psa 102:26 They pass away but you remain; they all wear out like a garment, like outworn clothes you change
them;

Psa 1 02:27 but you never alter, and your years never end.

Psa 1 02:28 The children of those who serve you will dwell secure, and their descendants live on in your
presence.

Psa 103:1 [Of David] Bless Yahweh, my soul, from the depths of my being, his holy name;

Psa 103:2 bless Yahweh, my soul, never forget all his acts of kindness.

Psa 1 03:3 He forgives all your offences, cures all your diseases,

Psa 103:4 he redeems your life from the abyss, crowns you with faithful love and tenderness;

Psa 103:5 he contents you with good things all your life, renews your youth like an eagle’s.

Psa 103:6 Yahweh acts with uprightness, with justice to all who are oppressed;

Psa 103:7 he revealed to Moses his ways, his great deeds to the children of Israel.

Psa 103:8 Yahweh is tenderness and pity, slow to anger and rich in faithful love;

Psa 1 03:9 his indignation does not last for ever, nor his resentment remain for all time;

Psa 103:10 he does not treat us as our sins deserve, nor repay us as befits our offences.

Psa 103:1 1 As the height of heaven above earth, so strong is his faithful love for those who fear him.

Psa 103:12 As the distance of east from west, so far from us does he put our faults.

Psa 103:13 As tenderly as a father treats his children, so Yahweh treats those who fear him;

Psa 103:14 he knows of what we are made, he remembers that we are dust.

Psa 103:15 As for a human person — his days are like grass, he blooms like the wild flowers;

Psa 103:16 as soon as the wind blows he is gone, never to be seen there again.

Psa 103:17 But Yahweh’s faithful love for those who fear him is from eternity and for ever; and his saving justice
to their children’s children;

Psa 103:18 as long as they keep his covenant, and carefully obey his precepts.

Psa 103:19 Yahweh has fixed his throne in heaven, his sovereign power rules over all.

Psa 103:20 Bless Yahweh, all his angels, mighty warriors who fulfil his commands, attentive to the sound of his

words.

Psa 103:21 Bless Yahweh, all his armies, servants who fulfil his wishes.

Psa 103:22 Bless Yahweh, all his works, in every place where he rules. Bless Yahweh, my soul.

Psa 104:1 Bless Yahweh, my soul, Yahweh, my God, how great you are! Clothed in majesty and splendour,

Psa 104:2 wearing the light as a robe! You stretch out the heavens like a tent,

Psa 1 04:3 build your palace on the waters above, making the clouds your chariot, gliding on the wings of the
wind,

Psa 104:4 appointing the winds your messengers, flames of fire your servants.

Psa 104:5 You fixed the earth on its foundations, for ever and ever it shall not be shaken;

Psa 104:6 you covered it with the deep like a garment, the waters overtopping the mountains.

Psa 1 04:7 At your reproof the waters fled, at the voice of your thunder they sped away,

Psa 104:8 flowing over mountains, down valleys, to the place you had fixed for them;

Psa 104:9 you made a limit they were not to cross, they were not to return and cover the earth.

Psa 104:10 In the ravines you opened up springs, running down between the mountains,



Psa 104:1 1 supplying water for all the wild beasts; the wild asses quench their thirst,

Psa 104:12 on their banks the birds of the air make their nests, they sing among the leaves.

Psa 104:13 From your high halls you water the mountains, satisfying the earth with the fruit of your works:

Psa 104:14 for cattle you make the grass grow, and for people the plants they need, to bring forth food from the
earth,

Psa 104:15 and wine to cheer people’s hearts, oil to make their faces glow, food to make them sturdy of heart.
Psa 104:16 The trees of Yahweh drink their fill, the cedars of Lebanon which he sowed;

Psa 104:17 there the birds build their nests, on the highest branches the stork makes its home;

Psa 104:18 for the wild goats there are the mountains, in the crags the coneys find refuge.

Psa 104:19 He made the moon to mark the seasons, the sun knows when to set.

Psa 104:20 You bring on darkness, and nightfalls, when all the forest beasts roam around;

Psa 1 04:21 young lions roar for their prey, asking God for their food.

Psa 104:22 The sun rises and away they steal, back to their lairs to lie down,

Psa 1 04:23 and man goes out to work, to labour till evening falls.

Psa 104:24 How countless are your works, Yahweh, all of them made so wisely! The earth is full of your
creatures.

Psa 104:25 Then there is the sea, with its vast expanses teeming with countless creatures, creatures both great
and small;

Psa 104:26 there ships pass to and fro, and Leviathan whom you made to sport with.

Psa 104:27 They all depend upon you, to feed them when they need it.

Psa 1 04:28 You provide the food they gather, your open hand gives them their fill.

Psa 1 04:29 T urn away your face and they panic; take back their breath and they die and revert to dust.

Psa 1 04:30 Send out your breath and life begins; you renew the face of the earth.

Psa 1 04:31 Glory to Yahweh for ever! May Yahweh find joy in his creatures!

Psa 104:32 At his glance the earth trembles, at his touch the mountains pour forth smoke.

Psa 104:33 I shall sing to Yahweh all my life, make music for my God as long as I live.

Psa 1 04:34 May my musings be pleasing to him, for Yahweh gives me joy.

Psa 104:35 May sinners vanish from the earth, and the wicked exist no more! Bless Yahweh, my soul.

Psa 105:1 Alleluia! Give thanks to Yahweh, call on his name, proclaim his deeds to the peoples!

Psa 105:2 Sing to him, make music for him, recount all his wonders!

Psa 105:3 Glory in his holy name, let the hearts that seek Yahweh rejoice!

Psa 105:4 Seek Yahweh and his strength, tirelessly seek his presence!

Psa 1 05:5 Remember the marvels he has done, his wonders, the judgements he has spoken.

Psa 105:6 Stock of Abraham, his servant, children of Jacob whom he chose!

Psa 105:7 He is Yahweh our God, his judgements touch the whole world.

Psa 105:8 He remembers his covenant for ever, the promise he laid down for a thousand generations,

Psa 105:9 which he concluded with Abraham, the oath he swore to Isaac.

Psa 105:10 He established it as a statute for Jacob, an everlasting covenant with Israel,

Psa 105:11 saying, To you I give a land, Canaan, your allotted birthright”.

Psa 105:12 When they were insignificant in numbers, a handful of strangers in the land,

Psa 105:13 wandering from country to country, from one kingdom and nation to another,

Psa 105:14 he allowed no one to oppress them; for their sake he instructed kings,

Psa 105:15 “Do not touch my anointed ones, to my prophets you may do no harm”.

Psa 105:16 He called down famine on the land, he took away theirfood supply;

Psa 105:17 he sent a man ahead of them, Joseph, sold as a slave.

Psa 105:18 So his feet were weighed down with shackles, his neck was put in irons.

Psa 105:19 In due time his prophecy was fulfilled, the word of Yahweh proved him true.

Psa 1 05:20 The king sent orders to release him, the ruler of nations set him free;

Psa 1 05:21 he put him in charge of his household, the ruler of all he possessed,

Psa 105:22 to instruct his princes as he saw fit, to teach his counsellors wisdom.

Psa 105:23 Then Israel migrated to Egypt, Jacob settled in the country of Ham.

Psa 105:24 He made his people increase in numbers, he gave them more strength than their enemies,

Psa 105:25 whose heart he turned to hate his own people, to double-cross his servants.

Psa 105:26 He sent his servant Moses, and Aaron, the man of his choice.

Psa 105:27 They worked there the wonders he commanded, marvels in the country of Ham.

Psa 105:28 Darkness he sent, and darkness fell, but that nation defied his orders.

Psa 105:29 He turned their rivers to blood, and killed all the fish in them.

Psa 105:30 Their country was overrun with frogs, even in the royal apartments;

Psa 105:31 at his word came flies, and mosquitoes throughout the country.



Psa 105:32 He gave them hail as their rain, flames of fire in their land;

Psa 1 05:33 he blasted their vine and their fig tree, and shattered the trees of the country.

Psa 105:34 At his word came locusts, hoppers beyond all counting;

Psa 105:35 they devoured every green thing in the land, devoured all the produce of the soil.

Psa 1 05:36 He struck all the first-born in their land, the flower of all their manhood;

Psa 1 05:37 he led Israel out with silver and gold; in their tribes there was none who stumbled.

Psa 1 05:38 Egypt was glad at their leaving, for terror of Israel had seized them.

Psa 105:39 He spread out a cloud to cover them, and fire to light up the night.

Psa 105:40 They asked and he brought them quails, food from heaven to their hearts’ content;

Psa 105:41 he opened a rock, the waters gushed out, and flowed in dry ground as a river.

Psa 105:42 Faithful to his sacred promise, given to his servant Abraham,

Psa 105:43 he led out his people with rejoicing, his chosen ones with shouts of joy.

Psa 105:44 He gave them the territories of nations, they reaped the fruit of other people’s labours,

Psa 105:45 on condition that they kept his statutes, and remained obedient to his laws.

Psa 106:1 Alleluia! Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, his faithful love is everlasting!

Psa 106:2 Who can recount all Yahweh’s triumphs, who can fully voice his praise?

Psa 1 06:3 How blessed are those who keep to what is just, whose conduct is always upright!

Psa 1 06:4 Remember me, Yahweh, in your love for your people. Come near to me with your saving power,

Psa 1 06:5 let me share the happiness of your chosen ones, let me share the joy of your people, the pride of
your heritage.

Psa 106:6 Like our ancestors, we have sinned, we have acted wickedly, guiltily;

Psa 1 06:7 our ancestors in Egypt never grasped the meaning of your wonders. They did not bear in mind your
countless acts of love, at the Sea of Reeds they defied the Most High;

Psa 1 06:8 but for the sake of his name he saved them, to make known his mighty power.

Psa 106:9 At his rebuke the Sea of Reeds dried up, he let them pass through the deep as though it were desert,
Psa 106:10 so he saved them from their opponents’ clutches, rescued them from the clutches of their enemies.
Psa 106:11 The waters enveloped their enemies, not one of whom was left.

Psa 106:12 Then they believed what he had said, and sang his praises.

Psa 106:13 But they soon forgot his achievements, they did not even wait for his plans;

Psa 106:14 they were overwhelmed with greed in the wastelands, in the solitary wastes they challenged God.
Psa 106:15 He gave them all they asked for, but struck them with a deep wasting sickness;

Psa 106:16 in the camp they grew jealous of Moses, and of Aaron, Yahweh’s holy one.

Psa 106:17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, closed in on Abiram’s faction;

Psa 106:18 fire flamed out against their faction, the renegades were engulfed in flames.

Psa 106:19 At Horeb they made a calf, bowed low before cast metal;

Psa 1 06:20 they exchanged their glory for the image of a grass-eating bull.

Psa 1 06:21 They forgot the God who was saving them, who had done great deeds in Egypt,

Psa 106:22 such wonders in the land of Ham, such awesome deeds at the Sea of Reeds.

Psa 106:23 He thought of putting an end to them, had not Moses, his chosen one, taken a stand in the breach
and confronted him, to turn his anger away from destroying them.

Psa 106:24 They counted a desirable land for nothing, they put no trust in his promise;

Psa 1 06:25 they stayed in their tents and grumbled, they would not listen to Yahweh’s voice.

Psa 106:26 So he lifted his hand against them, to strike them down in the desert,

Psa 106:27 to strike down their descendants among the nations, to scatter them all over the world.

Psa 106:28 They committed themselves to serve Baal-Peor, and ate sacrifices made to lifeless gods.

Psa 106:29 They so provoked him by their actions that a plague broke out among them.

Psa 106:30 Then up stood Phinehas to intervene, and the plague was checked;

Psa 1 06:31 for this he is the example of uprightness, from age to age for ever.

Psa 106:32 At the waters of Meribah they so angered Yahweh, that Moses suffered on their account,

Psa 106:33 for they had embittered his spirit, and he spoke without due thought.

Psa 106:34 They did not destroy the nations, as Yahweh had told them to do,

Psa 106:35 but intermarried with them, and adopted their ways.

Psa 106:36 They worshipped those nations’ false gods, till they found themselves entrapped,

Psa 106:37 and sacrificed their own sons and their daughters to demons.

Psa 1 06:38 Innocent blood they shed, the blood of their sons and daughters; offering them to the idols of
Canaan, they polluted the country with blood.

Psa 1 06:39 They defiled themselves by such actions, their behaviour was that of a harlot.

Psa 106:40 Yahweh’s anger blazed out at his people, his own heritage filled him with disgust.

Psa 1 06:41 He handed them over to the nations, and their opponents became their masters;



Psa 1 06:42 their enemies lorded it over them, crushing them under their rule.

Psa 1 06:43 Time and again he rescued them, but they still defied him deliberately, and sank ever deeper in their
guilt;

Psa 106:44 even so he took pity on their distress, as soon as he heard them cry out.

Psa 106:45 Bearing his covenant with them in mind, he relented in his boundless and faithful love;

Psa 1 06:46 he ensured that they received compassion, in their treatment by all their captors.

Psa 106:47 Save us, Yahweh our God, gather us from among the nations, that we may give thanks to your holy
name, and may glory in praising you.

Psa 106:48 Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, from all eternity and for ever! Let all the people say, “Amen 1 .
Psa 107:1 Alleluia! Give thanks to Yahweh for he is good, his faithful love lasts for ever.

Psa 107:2 So let them say whom Yahweh redeemed, whom he redeemed from the power of their enemies,

Psa 107:3 bringing them back from foreign lands, from east and west, north and south.

Psa 107:4 They were wandering in the desert, in the wastelands, could find no way to an inhabited city;

Psa 107:5 they were hungry and thirsty, their life was ebbing away.

Psa 107:6 They cried out to Yahweh in their distress, he rescued them from their plight,

Psa 107:7 he set them on the road, straight to an inhabited city.

Psa 107:8 Let them thank Yahweh for his faithful love, for his wonders for the children of Adam!

Psa 107:9 He has fed the hungry to their hearts’ content, filled the starving with good things.

Psa 107:10 Sojourners in gloom and shadow dark as death, fettered in misery and chains,

Psa 107:11 for defying the orders of Yahweh, for scorning the plan of the Most High-
Psa 107:12 he subdued their spirit by hard labour; if they fell there was no one to help.

Psa 107:13 They cried out to Yahweh in their distress, he rescued them from their plight,

Psa 107:14 he brought them out from gloom and shadow dark as death, and shattered their chains.

Psa 107:15 Let them thank Yahweh for his faithful love, for his wonders for the children of Adam!

Psa 107:16 He broke open gates of bronze and smashed iron bars.

Psa 107:17 Fools for their rebellious ways, wretched because of their sins,

Psa 107:18 finding all food repugnant, brought close to the gates of death-

Psa 107:19 they cried out to Yahweh in their distress; he rescued them from their plight,

Psa 107:20 he sent out his word and cured them, and rescued their life from the abyss.

Psa 107:21 Let them thank Yahweh for his faithful love, for his wonders for the children of Adam!

Psa 107:22 Let them offer thanksgiving sacrifices, and recount with shouts of joy what he has done!

Psa 107:23 Voyagers on the sea in ships, plying their trade on the great ocean,

Psa 107:24 have seen the works of Yahweh, his wonders in the deep.

Psa 107:25 By his word he raised a storm-wind, lashing up towering waves.

Psa 107:26 Up to the sky then down to the depths! Their stomachs were turned to water;

Psa 107:27 they staggered and reeled like drunkards, and all their skill went under.

Psa 107:28 They cried out to Yahweh in their distress, he rescued them from their plight,

Psa 107:29 he reduced the storm to a calm, and all the waters subsided,

Psa 107:30 and he brought them, overjoyed at the stillness, to the port where they were bound.

Psa 107:31 Let them thank Yahweh for his faithful love, for his wonders for the children of Adam!

Psa 107:32 Let them extol him in the assembly of the people, and praise him in the council of elders.

Psa 107:33 He has turned rivers into desert, bubbling springs into arid ground,

Psa 107:34 fertile country into salt-flats, because the people living there were evil.

Psa 107:35 But he has turned desert into stretches of water, arid ground into bubbling springs,

Psa 107:36 and has given the hungry a home, where they have built themselves a city.

Psa 107:37 There they sow fields and plant vines, and reap a harvest of their produce.

Psa 107:38 He blesses them and their numbers increase, he keeps their cattle at full strength.

Psa 107:39 Their numbers had fallen, they had grown weak, under pressure of disaster and hardship;

Psa 107:40 he covered princes in contempt, left them to wander in trackless wastes.

Psa 107:41 But the needy he raises from their misery, makes their families as numerous as sheep.

Psa 107:42 At the sight the honest rejoice, and the wicked have nothing to say.

Psa 107:43 Who is wise? Such a one should take this to heart, and come to understand Yahweh’s faithful love.
Psa 108:1 [Song Psalm Of David] My heart is ready, God, I will sing and make music; come, my glory!

Psa 108:2 Awake, lyre and harp, I will awake the Dawn!

Psa 108:3 I will praise you among the peoples, Yahweh, I will play to you among nations,

Psa 108:4 for your faithful love towers to heaven, and your constancy to the clouds.

Psa 1 08:5 Be exalted above the heavens, God. Your glory over the whole earth!

Psa 108:6 To rescue those you love, save with your right hand and answer us.

Psa 108:7 God has spoken from his sanctuary, “In triumph I will divide up Shechem, and share out the Valley of



Succoth.

Psa 108:8 “Mine is Gilead, mine Manasseh, Ephraim the helmet on my head, Judah my commander’s baton,

Psa 108:9 “Moab a bowl for me to wash in, on Edom I plant my sandal, over Philistia I cry victory”.

Psa 108:10 Who will lead me against a fortified city, who will guide me into Edom,

Psa 108:1 1 if not you, the God who has rejected us? God, you no longer march with our armies.

Psa 108:12 Bring us help in our time of crisis, any human assistance is worthless.

Psa 108:13 With God we shall do deeds of valour, he will trample down our enemies.

Psa 109:1 [For the choirmaster Of David Psalm] God whom I praise, do not be silent!

Psa 109:2 Wicked and deceiving words are being said about me, false accusations are cast in my teeth.

Psa 109:3 Words of hate fly all around me, though I give no cause for hostility.

Psa 109:4 In return for my friendship they denounce me, and all I can do is pray!

Psa 109:5 They repay my kindness with evil, and friendship with hatred.

Psa 109:6 “Set up a wicked man against him as accuser to stand on his right.

Psa 109:7 At his trial may he emerge as guilty, even his prayer construed as a crime!

Psa 109:8 “May his life be cut short, someöne else take over his office,

Psa 109:9 his children be orphaned, his wife be widowed.

Psa 109:10 “May his children wander perpetually, beggars, driven from the ruins of their house,

Psa 109:11 a creditor seize all his goods, and strangers make off with his earnings.

Psa 109:12 “May there be none left faithful enough to show him love, no one take pity on his orphans,

Psa 109:13 the line of his descendants cut off, his name wiped out in one generation.

Psa 109:14 “May Yahweh never forget the crimes of his ancestors, and his mother’s sins not be wiped out;

Psa 109:15 may Yahweh keep these constantly in mind, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth”.

Psa 109:16 He had no thought of being loyal, but hounded the poor and the needy and the broken-hearted to
their death.

Psa 109:17 He had a taste for cursing; let it recoil on him! No taste for blessing; let it never come his way!

Psa 109:18 Cursing has been the uniform he wore; let it soak into him like water, like oil right into his bones.

Psa 109:19 Let it be as a robe which envelops him completely, a sash which he always wears.

Psa 109:20 Let this be the salary Yahweh pays the accusers who blacken my name.

Psa 109:21 Yahweh, treat them as your name demands; as your faithful love is generous, deliver me.

Psa 109:22 Poor and needy as I am, my wounds go right to the heart;

Psa 109:23 I am passing away like a fading shadow, they have shaken me off like a locust.

Psa 109:24 My knees are weak from lack of food, my body lean for lack of fat.

Psa 1 09:25 I have become the butt of their taunts, they shake their heads at the sight of me.

Psa 109:26 Help me, Yahweh my God, save me as your faithful love demands.

Psa 109:27 Let them know that yours is the saving hand, that this, Yahweh, is your work.

Psa 1 09:28 Let them curse, provided that you bless; let their attacks bring shame to them and joy to your
servant!

Psa 109:29 Let my accusers be clothed in disgrace, enveloped in a cloak of shame.

Psa 109:30 With generous thanks to Yahweh on my lips, I shall praise him before all the people,

Psa 1 09:31 for he stands at the side of the poor, to save their lives from those who sit in judgement on them.

Psa 114:1 Alleluia! When Israel came out of Egypt, the House of Jacob from a people of foreign speech,

Psa 114:2 Judah became his sanctuary, and Israel his domain.

Psa 1 14:3 The sea fled at the sight, the Jordan turned back,

Psa 114:4 the mountains skipped like rams, the hills like sheep.

Psa 1 14:5 Sea, what makes you flee? Jordan, why turn back?

Psa 114:6 Why skip like rams, you mountains? Why like sheep, you hills?

Psa 1 14:7 Tremble, earth, at the coming of the Lord, at the coming of the God of Jacob,

Psa 1 14:8 who turns rock into pool, flint into fountain.

Psa 1 15:1 Not to us, Yahweh, not to us, but to your name give the glory, for your faithful love and your
constancy!

Psa 115:2 Why should the nations ask, “Where is their God?”.

Psa 1 1 5:3 Our God is in heaven, he creates whatever he chooses.

Psa 1 1 5:4 They have idols of silver and gold, made by human hands.

Psa 1 1 5:5 These have mouths but say nothing, have eyes but see nothing,

Psa 1 1 5:6 have ears but hear nothing, have noses but smell nothing.

Psa 1 15:7 They have hands but cannot feel, have feet but cannot walk, no sound comes from their throats.

Psa 1 1 5:8 Their makers will end up like them, and all who rely on them.

Psa 1 1 5:9 House of Israel, rely on Yahweh; he is their help and their shield.

Psa 115:10 House of Aaron, rely on Yahweh; he is their help and their shield.

Psa 1 15:1 1 You who fear Yahweh, rely on Yahweh; he is their help and their shield.

Psa 1 15:12 Yahweh will keep us in mind, he will bless, he will bless the House of Israel, he will bless the House
of Aaron,

Psa 1 15:13 he will bless those who fear Yahweh, small and great alike.

Psa 1 15:14 May Yahweh add to your numbers, yours and your children’s too!

Psa 115:15 May you be blessed by Yahweh, who made heaven and earth.

Psa 1 15:16 Heaven belongs to Yahweh, but earth he has given to the children of Adam.

Psa 1 15:17 The dead cannot praise Yahweh, those who sink into silence,

Psa 1 15:18 but we, the living, shall bless Yahweh, henceforth and for ever.

Psa 1 16:1 Alleluia! I am filled with love when Yahweh listens to the sound of my prayer,

Psa 1 16:2 when he bends down to hear me, as I call.

Psa 1 16:3 The bonds of death were all round me, the snares of Sheol held me fast; distress and anguish held
me in their grip,

Psa 1 16:4 I called on the name of Yahweh. Deliver me, Yahweh, I beg you.

Psa 116:5 Yahweh is merciful and upright, our God is tenderness.

Psa 1 16:6 Yahweh looks after the simple, when I was brought low he gave me strength.

Psa 1 16:7 My heart, be at peace once again, for Yahweh has treated you generously.

Psa 1 16:8 He has rescued me from death, my eyes from tears, and my feet from stumbling.



Psa 116:9 I shall pass my life in the presence of Yahweh, in the land of the living.

Psa 1 16:10 My trust does not fail even when I say, “I am completely wretched”.

Psa 1 16:1 1 In my terror I said, “No human being can be relied on”.

Psa 1 16:12 What return can I make to Yahweh for his generosity to me?

Psa 116:13 I shall take up the cup of salvation and call on the name of Yahweh.

Psa 1 16:14 I shall fulfil my vows to Yahweh, witnessed by all his people.

Psa 1 16:15 Costly in Yahweh’s sight is the death of his faithful.

Psa 1 16:16 I beg you, Yahweh! I am your servant, I am your servant and my mother was your servant; you have
undone my fetters.

Psa 116:17 I shall offer you a sacrifice of thanksgiving and call on the name of Yahweh.

Psa 116:18 I shall fulfil my vows to Yahweh, witnessed by all his people,

Psa 1 16:19 in the courts of the house of Yahweh, in your very heart, Jerusalem.

Psa 117:1 Alleluia! Praise Yahweh, all nations, extol him, all peoples,

Psa 117:2 for his faithful love is strong and his constancy never-ending.

Psa 1 18:1 Alleluia! Give thanks to Yahweh for he is good, for his faithful love endures for ever.

Psa 1 1 8:2 Let the House of Israel say, “His faithful love endures for ever”.

Psa 1 1 8:3 Let the House of Aaron say, “His faithful love endures for ever”.

Psa 1 1 8:4 Let those who fear Yahweh say, “His faithful love endures for ever”.

Psa 118:5 In my distress I called to Yahweh, he heard me and brought me relief.

Psa 118:6 With Yahweh on my side I fear nothing; what can human beings do to me?

Psa 1 1 8:7 With Yahweh on my side as my help, I gloat over my enemies.

Psa 1 1 8:8 It is better to take refuge in Yahweh than to rely on human beings;

Psa 1 18:9 better to take refuge in Yahweh than to rely on princes.

Psa 1 18:10 Nations were swarming around me, in the name of Yahweh I cut them down;

Psa 1 18:1 1 they swarmed around me, pressing upon me, in the name of Yahweh I cut them down.

Psa 1 18:12 They swarmed around me like bees, they flared up like a brushwood fire, in the name of Yahweh I
cut them down.

Psa 1 18:13 I was pushed hard, to make me fall, but Yahweh came to my help.

Psa 1 18:14 Yahweh is my strength and my song, he has been my Saviour.

Psa 118:15 Shouts of joy and salvation, in the tents of the upright, “Yahweh’s right hand is triumphant,

Psa 118:16 Yahweh’s right hand is victorious, Yahweh’s right hand is triumphant!”.

Psa 1 18:17 I shall not die, I shall live to recount the great deeds of Yahweh.

Psa 1 18:18 Though Yahweh punished me sternly, he has not abandoned me to death.

Psa 1 18:19 Open for me the gates of saving justice, I shall go in and thank Yahweh.

Psa 1 1 8:20 This is the gate of Yahweh, where the upright go in.

Psa 1 1 8:21 I thank you for hearing me, and making yourself my Saviour.

Psa 1 18:22 The stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone;

Psa 1 1 8:23 This is Yahweh’s doing, and we marvel at it.

Psa 1 1 8:24 This is the day which Yahweh has made, a day for us to rejoice and be glad.

Psa 118:25 We beg you, Yahweh, save us, we beg you, Yahweh, give us victory!

Psa 1 1 8:26 Blessed in the name of Yahweh is he who is coming! We bless you from the house of Yahweh.

Psa 118:27 Yahweh is God, he gives us light. Link your processions, branches in hand, up to the horns of the
altar.

Psa 1 1 8:28 You are my God, I thank you, all praise to you, my God. I thank you for hearing me, and making
yourself my Saviour.

Psa 1 1 8:29 Give thanks to Yahweh for he is good, for his faithful love endures for ever.

Psa 119:1 How blessed are those whose way is blameless, who walk in the Law of Yahweh!

Psa 119:2 Blessed are those who observe his instructions, who seek him with all their hearts,

Psa 1 1 9:3 and, doing no evil, who walk in his ways.

Psa 1 19:4 You lay down your precepts to be carefully kept.

Psa 1 1 9:5 May my ways be steady in doing your will.

Psa 119:6 Then I shall not be shamed, if my gaze is fixed on your commandments.

Psa 119:7 I thank you with a sincere heart for teaching me your upright judgements.

Psa 119:8 I shall do your will; do not ever abandon me wholly.

Psa 1 1 9:9 How can a young man keep his way spotless? By keeping your words.

Psa 1 19:10 With all my heart I seek you, do not let me stray from your commandments.

Psa 1 19:1 1 In my heart I treasure your promises, to avoid sinning against you.

Psa 1 19:12 Blessed are you, Yahweh, teach me your will!

Psa 1 19:13 With my lips I have repeated all the judgements you have given.

In the way of your instructions lies my joy, a joy beyond all wealth.

I will ponder your precepts and fix my gaze on your paths.

I find my delight in your will, I do not forget your words.

Be generous to your servant and I shall live, and shall keep your words.

Open my eyes and I shall fix my gaze on the wonders of your Law.

Wayfarer though I am on the earth, do not hide your commandments from me.

My heart is pining away with longing at all times for your judgements.

You have rebuked the arrogant, the accursed, who stray from your commandments.

Set me free from taunts and contempt since I observe your instructions.

Though princes sit plotting against me, your servant keeps pondering your will.

Your instructions are my delight, your wishes my counsellors.

Down in the dust I lie prostrate; true to your word, revive me.

I tell you my ways and you answer me; teach me your wishes.

Show me the way of your precepts, that I may reflect on your wonders.

I am melting away for grief; true to your word, raise me up.

Keep me far from the way of deceit, grant me the grace of your Law.

I have chosen the way of constancy, I have moulded myself to your judgements.

I cling to your instructions, Yahweh, do not disappoint me.

I run the way of your commandments, for you have given me freedom of heart.

Teach me, Yahweh, the way of your will, and I will observe it.

Give me understanding and I will observe your Law, and keep it wholeheartedly.

Guide me in the way of your commandments, for my delight is there.

Bend my heart to your instructions, not to selfish gain.

Avert my eyes from pointless images, by your word give me life.

Keep your promise to your servant so that all may hold you in awe.

Avert the taunts that I dread, for your judgements are generous.

See how I yearn for your precepts; in your saving justice give me life.

Let your faithful love come to me, Yahweh, true to your promise, save me!

Give me an answer to the taunts against me, since I rely on your word.

Do not deprive me of that faithful word, since my hope lies in your judgements.

I shall keep your Law without fail for ever and ever.

I shall live in all freedom because I have sought your precepts.

I shall speak of your instructions before kings and will not be shamed.

Your commandments fill me with delight, I love them dearly.

I stretch out my hands to your commandments that I love, and I ponder your judgements.
Keep in mind your promise to your servant on which I have built my hope.

It is my comfort in distress, that your promise gives me life.

Endlessly the arrogant have jeered at me, but I have not swerved from your Law.

I have kept your age — old judgements in mind, Yahweh, and I am comforted.

Fury grips me when I see the wicked who abandon your Law.

Your judgements are my song where I live in exile.

All night, Yahweh, I hold your name in mind, I keep your Law.

This is what it means to me, observing your precepts.

My task, I have said, Yahweh, is to keep your word.

Wholeheartedly I entreat your favour; true to your promise, take pity on me!

I have reflected on my ways, and I turn my steps to your instructions.

I hurry without delay to keep your commandments.

Though caught in the snares of the wicked, I do not forget your Law.

At midnight I rise to praise you for your upright judgements.

I am a friend to all who fear you and keep your precepts.

Your faithful love fills the earth, Yahweh, teach me your judgements.

You have been generous to your servant, Yahweh, true to your promise.

Teach me judgement and knowledge, for I rely on your commandments.

Before I was punished I used to go astray, but now I keep to your promise.

You are generous and act generously, teach me your will.

The arrogant blacken me with lies though I wholeheartedly observe your precepts.

Their hearts are gross like rich fat, but my delight is in your Law.

It was good for me that I had to suffer, the better to learn your judgements.

The Law you have uttered is more precious to me than all the wealth in the world.



Psa 1 1 9:73 Your hands have made me and held me firm, give me understanding and I shall learn your
commandments.

Psa 1 1 9:74 Those who fear you rejoice at the sight of me since I put my hope in your word.

Psa 1 1 9:75 I know, Yahweh, that your judgements are upright, and in punishing me you show your constancy.
Psa 1 1 9:76 Your faithful love must be my consolation, as you have promised your servant.

Psa 1 1 9:77 T reat me with tenderness and I shall live, for your Law is my delight.

Psa 1 1 9:78 Let the arrogant who tell lies against me be shamed, while I ponder your precepts.

Psa 1 1 9:79 Let those who fear you rally to me, those who understand your instructions.

Psa 1 1 9:80 My heart shall be faultless towards your will; then I shall not be ashamed.

Psa 1 1 9:81 I shall wear myself out for your salvation, for your word is my hope.

Psa 1 1 9:82 My eyes, too, are worn out waiting for your promise, when will you have pity on me?

Psa 1 1 9:83 For I am like a smoked wineskin, but I do not forget your will.

Psa 1 1 9:84 How long has your servant to live? When will you bring my persecutors to judgement?

Psa 1 1 9:85 The arrogant have dug pitfalls for me in defiance of your Law.

Psa 119:86 All your commandments show constancy. Help me when they pursue me dishonestly.

Psa 1 1 9:87 They have almost annihilated me on earth, but I have not deserted your precepts.

Psa 119:88 True to your faithful love, give me life, and I shall keep the instructions you have laid down.

Psa 119:89 Forever, Yahweh, your word is planted firm in heaven.

Psa 1 1 9:90 Your constancy endures from age to age; you established the earth and it stands firm.

Psa 1 1 9:91 Through your judgements all stands firm to this day, for all creation is your servant.

Psa 119:92 Had your Law not been my delight, I would have perished in my misery.

Psa 1 1 9:93 I shall never forget your precepts, for by them you have given me life.

Psa 1 1 9:94 I am yours, save me, for I seek your precepts.

Psa 1 1 9:95 The wicked may hope to destroy me, but all my thought is of your instructions.

Psa 1 1 9:96 I have seen that all perfection is finite, but your commandment has no limit.

Psa 1 1 9:97 How I love your Law! I ponder it all day long.

Psa 1 1 9:98 You make me wiser than my enemies by your commandment which is mine for ever.

Psa 1 1 9:99 I am wiser than all my teachers because I ponder your instructions.

Psa 119:100 I have more understanding than the aged because I keep your precepts.

Psa 1 19:101 I restrain my foot from evil paths to keep your word.

Psa 1 19:102 Ido not turn aside from your judgements, because you yourself have instructed me.

Psa 119:103 How pleasant your promise to my palate, sweeter than honey in my mouth!

Psa 119:104 From your precepts I learn wisdom, so I hate all deceptive ways.

Psa 1 19:105 Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light on my path.

Psa 1 19:106 I have sworn — and shall maintain it — to keep your upright judgements.

Psa 1 19:107 I am utterly wretched, Yahweh; true to your promise, give me life.

Psa 119:108 Accept, Yahweh, the tribute from my mouth, and teach me your judgements.

Psa 1 19:109 My life is in your hands perpetually, I do not forget your Law.

Psa 1 19:1 10 The wicked have laid out a snare for me, but I have not strayed from your precepts.

Psa 1 19:1 1 1 Your instructions are my eternal heritage, they are the joy of my heart.

Psa 1 19:1 12 I devote myself to obeying your statutes, their recompense is eternal.

Psa 1 19:1 13 I hate a divided heart, I love your Law.

Psa 1 19:1 14 You are my refuge and shield, I put my hope in your word.

Psa 1 19:1 15 Leave me alone, you wicked, I shall observe the commandments of my God.

Psa 1 19:1 16 True to your word, support me and I shall live; do not disappoint me of my hope.

Psa 1 19:1 17 Uphold me and I shall be saved, my gaze fixed on your will.

Psa 1 19:1 18 You shake off all who stray from your will; deceit fills their horizon.

Psa 1 19:1 19 In your sight all the wicked of the earth are like rust, so I love your instructions.

Psa 1 19:120 My whole body trembles before you, your judgements fill me with fear.

Psa 1 19:121 All my conduct has been just and upright, do not hand me over to my oppressors.

Psa 1 19:122 Guarantee the well-being of your servant, do not let the proud oppress me.

Psa 1 19:123 My eyes are languishing for your salvation and for the saving justice you have promised.

Psa 1 19:124 Show your faithful love to your servant, teach me your judgements.

Psa 1 19:125 Your servant am I; give me understanding and I shall know your instructions.

Psa 1 19:126 It is time to take action, Yahweh, your Law is being broken.

Psa 1 19:127 So I love your commandments more than gold, purest gold.

Psa 119:128 Sol rule my life by your precepts, I hate all deceptive paths.

Psa 119:129 Wonderful are your instructions, so I observe them.

Psa 1 19:130 As your word unfolds it gives light, and even the simple understand.



Psa 1 19:131 I open wide my mouth, panting eagerly for your commandments.

Psa 1 19:132 Turn to me, pity me; those who love your name deserve it.

Psa 1 19:133 Keep my steps firm in your promise; that no evil may triumph over me.

Psa 119:134 Rescue me from human oppression, and I will observe your precepts.

Psa 1 19:135 Let your face shine on your servant, teach me your will.

Psa 119:136 My eyes stream with tears because your Law is disregarded.

Psa 119:137 You are upright, Yahweh, and your judgements are honest.

Psa 119:138 You impose uprightness as a witness to yourself, it is constancy itself.

Psa 1 19:139 My zeal is burning me up because my oppressors forget your word.

Psa 1 19:140 Your promise is well tested, your servant holds it dear.

Psa 1 19:141 Puny and despised as I am, I do not forget your precepts.

Psa 1 19:142 Your saving justice is for ever just, and your Law is trustworthy.

Psa 1 19:143 Though anguish and distress grip me your commandments are my delight.

Psa 119:144 Your instructions are upright for ever, give me understanding and I shall live.

Psa 1 19:145 I call with all my heart; answer me, Yahweh, and I will observe your judgements.

Psa 1 19:146 I call to you; save me, and I will keep your instructions.

Psa 1 19:147 I am awake before dawn to cry for help, I put my hope in your word.

Psa 1 19:148 My eyes are awake before each watch of the night, to ponder your promise.

Psa 1 19:149 In your faithful love, Yahweh, listen to my voice, let your judgements give me life.

Psa 119:150 My pursuers are coming closer to their wicked designs, and further from your Law.

Psa 1 19:151 You are close to me, Yahweh, and all your commandments are true.

Psa 1 19:152 Long have I known that your instructions were laid down to last for ever.

Psa 1 19:153 Look at my suffering and rescue me, for I do not forget your Law.

Psa 119:154 Plead my cause and defend me; as you promised, give me life.

Psa 1 19:155 Salvation is far from the wicked, for they do not seek your will.

Psa 1 19:156 Your kindnesses to me are countless, Yahweh; true to your judgements, give me life.

Psa 119:157 Though my enemies and oppressors are countless, I do not turn aside from your instructions.
Psa 119:158 The sight of these renegades appals me; they do not observe your promise.

Psa 119:159 See how I love your precepts; true to your faithful love, give me life.

Psa 1 19:160 Faithfulness is the essence of your word, your upright judgements hold good for ever.

Psa 1 19:161 Though princes hound me unprovoked, what fills me with awe is your word.

Psa 1 19:162 I rejoice in your promise like one who finds a vast treasure.

Psa 1 19:163 Falsehood I hate and detest, my love is for your Law.

Psa 1 19:164 Seven times a day I praise you for your upright judgements.

Psa 1 19:165 Great peace for those who love your Law; no stumbling-blocks for them!

Psa 1 19:166 I am waiting for your salvation, Yahweh, I fulfil your commandments.

Psa 119:167 I observe your instructions, I love them dearly.

Psa 1 19:168 I observe your precepts, your judgements, for all my ways are before you.

Psa 119:169 May my cry approach your presence, Yahweh; by your word give me understanding.

Psa 1 19:170 May my prayer come into your presence, rescue me as you have promised.

Psa 1 19:171 May my lips proclaim your praise, for you teach me your will.

Psa 1 19:172 May my tongue recite your promise, for all your commandments are upright.

Psa 119:173 May your hand be there to help me, since I have chosen your precepts.

Psa 1 19:174 I long for your salvation, Yahweh, your Law is my delight.

Psa 1 19:175 May I live only to praise you, may your judgements be my help.

Psa 1 19:176 I am wandering like a lost sheep, come and look for your servant, for I have not forgotten your
commandments.

Psa 120:1 [Song of Ascents *{* The Songs of Ascents (Pss 120-134) were sung by pilgrims on their way up to
Jerusalem.} ] To Yahweh when I am in trouble I call and he answers me.

Psa 120:2 Yahweh, save me from lying lips and a treacherous tongue!

Psa 120:3 What will he repay you, what more, treacherous tongue?

Psa 120:4 War-arrows made sharp over red-hot charcoal.

Psa 120:5 How wretched I am, living in Meshech, dwelling in the tents of Kedar!

Psa 120:6 Too long have I lived among people who hate peace.

Psa 120:7 When I speak of peace they are all for war!

Psa 121:1 [Song of Ascents] I lift up my eyes to the mountains; where is my help to come from?

Psa 121 :2 My help comes from Yahweh who made heaven and earth.

Psa 121 :3 May he save your foot from stumbling; may he, your guardian, not fall asleep!

Psa 121 :4 You see — he neither sleeps nor slumbers, the guardian of Israel.



Psa 121 :5 Yahweh is your guardian, your shade, Yahweh, at your right hand.

Psa 121 :6 By day the sun will not strike you, nor the moon by night.

Psa 121 :7 Yahweh guards you from all harm Yahweh guards your life,

Psa 121 :8 Yahweh guards your comings and goings, henceforth and for ever.

Psa 122:1 [Song of Ascents Of David] I rejoiced that they said to me, “Let us go to the house of Yahweh”.

Psa 122:2 At last our feet are standing at your gates, Jerusalem!

Psa 122:3 Jerusalem, built as a city, in one united whole,

Psa 122:4 there the tribes go up, the tribes of Yahweh, a sign for Israel to give thanks to the name of Yahweh.
Psa 122:5 For there are set the thrones of judgement, the thrones of the house of David.

Psa 122:6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem, prosperity for your homes!

Psa 122:7 Peace within your walls, prosperity in your palaces!

Psa 122:8 For love of my brothers and my friends I will say, “Peace upon you!”.

Psa 122:9 For love of the house of Yahweh our God I will pray for your well-being.

Psa 123:1 [Song of Ascents] I lift up my eyes to you who are enthroned in heaven.

Psa 123:2 Just as the eyes of slaves are on their masters’ hand, or the eyes of a slave-girl on the hand of her
mistress, so our eyes are on Yahweh our God, for him to take pity on us.

Psa 123:3 Have pity on us, Yahweh, have pity, for we have had our full share of scorn,

Psa 123:4 more than our share of jeers from the complacent. (Scorn is for the proud.)

Psa 124:1 [Song of Ascents Of David] If Yahweh had not been on our side - let Israel repeat it-
Psa 124:2 if Yahweh had not been on our side when people attacked us,

Psa 1 24:3 they would have swallowed us alive in the heat of their anger.

Psa 124:4 Then water was washing us away, a torrent running right over us;

Psa 124:5 running right over us then were turbulent waters.

Psa 124:6 Blessed be Yahweh for not letting us fall a prey to their teeth!

Psa 124:7 We escaped like a bird from the fowlers’ net. The net was broken and we escaped;

Psa 124:8 our help is in the name of Yahweh, who made heaven and earth.

Psa 125:1 [Song of Ascents] Whoëver trusts in Yahweh is like Mount Zion: unshakeable, it stands for ever.

Psa 125:2 Jerusalem! The mountains encircle her: so Yahweh encircles his people, henceforth and for ever.

Psa 1 25:3 The sceptre of the wicked will not come to rest over the heritage of the upright; or the upright might
set their own hands to evil.

Psa 125:4 Do good, Yahweh, to those who are good, to the sincere at heart.

Psa 125:5 But the crooked, the twisted, turn them away, Yahweh, with evil-doers. Peace to Israel!

Psa 126:1 [Song of Ascents] When Yahweh brought back Zion’s captives we lived in a dream;

Psa 126:2 then our mouths filled with laughter, and our lips with song. Then the nations kept saying, “What great
deeds Yahweh has done for them!”.

Psa 126:3 Yes, Yahweh did great deeds for us, and we were overjoyed.

Psa 126:4 Bring back, Yahweh, our people from captivity like torrents in the Negeb!

Psa 126:5 Those who sow in tears sing as they reap.

Psa 126:6 He went off, went off weeping, carrying the seed. He comes back, comes back singing, bringing in
his sheaves.

Psa 127:1 [Song of Ascents Of Solomon] If Yahweh does not build a house in vain do its builders toil. If Yahweh
does not guard a city in vain does its guard keep watch.

Psa 127:2 In vain you get up earlier, and put off going to bed, sweating to make a living, since it is he who
provides for his beloved as they sleep.

Psa 127:3 Sons are a birthright from Yahweh, children are a reward from him.

Psa 127:4 Like arrows in a warrior’s hand are the sons you father when young.

Psa 127:5 How blessed is the man who has filled his quiver with them; in dispute with his enemies at the city
gate he will not be worsted.

Psa 128:1 [Song of Ascents] How blessed are all who fear Yahweh, who walk in his ways!

Psa 128:2 Your own labours will yield you a living, happy and prosperous will you be.

Psa 128:3 Your wife a fruitful vine in the inner places of your house. Your children round your table like shoots
of an olive tree.

Psa 128:4 Such are the blessings that fall on those who fear Yahweh.

Psa 128:5 May Yahweh bless you from Zion! May you see Jerusalem prosper all the days of your life,

Psa 128:6 and live to see your children’s children! Peace to Israel!

Psa 129:1 [Song of Ascents] Often as men have attacked me since I was young — let Israel repeat it-
Psa 129:2 often as men have attacked me since I was young, they have never overcome me.

Psa 129:3 On my back ploughmen have set to work, making long furrows,

Psa 129:4 but Yahweh the upright has shattered the yoke of the wicked.



Psa 129:5 Let all who hate Zion be thrown back in confusion,

Psa 129:6 let them be like grass on a roof, dried up before it is cut,

Psa 129:7 never to fill the reaper’s arm nor the binder’s lap.

Psa 129:8 And no passer-by will say, “The blessing of Yahweh be on you! “We bless you in the name of
Yahweh”.

Psa 130:1 [Song of Ascents] From the depths I call to you, Yahweh:

Psa 130:2 Lord, hear my cry. Listen attentively to the sound of my pleading!

Psa 130:3 If you kept a record of our sins, Lord, who could stand their ground?

Psa 130:4 But with you is forgiveness, that you may be revered.

Psa 130:5 I rely, my whole being relies, Yahweh, on your promise.

Psa 130:6 My whole being hopes in the Lord, more than watchmen for daybreak; more than watchmen for
daybreak

Psa 130:7 let Israel hope in Yahweh. For with Yahweh is faithful love, with him generous ransom;

Psa 130:8 and he will ransom Israel from all its sins.

Psa 132:1 [Song of Ascents] Yahweh, remember David and all the hardships he endured,

Psa 1 32:2 the oath he swore to Yahweh, his vow to the Mighty One of Jacob:

Psa 132:3 “I will not enter tent or house, will not climb into bed,

Psa 132:4 will not allow myself to sleep, not even to close my eyes,

Psa 1 32:5 till I have found a place for Yahweh, a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob!”.

Psa 132:6 Listen, we heard of it in Ephrathah, we found it at Forest-Fields.

Psa 132:7 Let us go into his dwelling-place, and worship at his footstool.

Psa 1 32:8 Go up, Yahweh, to your resting-place, you and the ark of your strength.

Psa 1 32:9 Your priests are robed in saving justice, your faithful are shouting for joy.

Psa 132:10 For the sake of your servant David, do not reject your anointed.

Psa 132:11 Yahweh has sworn to David, and will always remain true to his word, “I promise that I will set a son
of yours upon your throne.

Psa 132:12 If your sons observe my covenant and the instructions I have taught them, their sons too for
evermore will occupy your throne”.

Psa 132:13 For Yahweh has chosen Zion, he has desired it as a home.

Psa 132:14 “Here shall I rest for evermore, here shall I make my home as I have wished.

Psa 132:15 “I shall generously bless her produce, give her needy their fill of food,

Psa 132:16 I shall clothe her priests with salvation, and her faithful will sing aloud for joy.

Psa 132:17 “There I shall raise up a line of descendants for David, light a lamp for my anointed;

Psa 132:18 I shall clothe his enemies with shame, while his own crown shall flourish”.

Psa 135:13 Yahweh, your name endures for ever, Yahweh, your memory is fresh from age to age.

Psa 135:14 For Yahweh vindicates his people, feels compassion for his servants.

Psa 135:15 The idols of the nations are silver and gold, made by human hands.

Psa 135:16 These have mouths but say nothing, have eyes but see nothing,

Psa 135:17 have ears but hear nothing, and they have no breath in their mouths.

Psa 135:18 Their makers will end up like them, everyone who relies on them.

Psa 137:1 By the rivers of Babylon we sat and wept at the memory of Zion.

Psa 137:2 On the poplars there we had hung up our harps.

Psa 137:3 For there our gaolers had asked us to sing them a song, our captors to make merry, “Sing us one of
the songs of Zion”.

Psa 137:4 How could we sing a song of Yahweh on alien soil?

Psa 137:5 If I forget you, Jerusalem, may my right hand wither!

Psa 137:6 May my tongue remain stuck to my palate if I do not keep you in mind, if I do not count Jerusalem the
greatest of my joys.

Psa 137:7 Remember, Yahweh, to the Edomites’ cost, the day of Jerusalem, how they said, “Down with it! Rase
it to the ground!”.

Psa 137:8 Daughter of Babel, doomed to destruction, a blessing on anyone who treats you as you treated us,
Psa 137:9 a blessing on anyone who seizes your babies and shatters them against a rock!

Psa 138:1 [Of David] I thank you, Yahweh, with all my heart, for you have listened to the cry I uttered. In the
presence of angels I sing to you,

Psa 1 38:2 I bow down before your holy Temple. I praise your name for your faithful love and your constancy;
your promises surpass even your fame.

Psa 138:3 You heard me on the day when I called, and you gave new strength to my heart.

Psa 138:4 All the kings of the earth give thanks to you, Yahweh, when they hear the promises you make;

Psa 138:5 they sing of Yahweh’s ways, “Great is the glory of Yahweh!”.

Psa 138:6 Sublime as he is, Yahweh looks on the humble, the proud he picks out from afar.

Psa 138:7 Though I live surrounded by trouble you give me life — to my enemies’ fury! You stretch out your right
hand and save me,



Psa 138:8 Yahweh will do all things for me. Yahweh, your faithful love endures for ever, do not abandon what
you have made.

Psa 139:1 [For the choirmaster Of David Psalm] Yahweh, you examine me and know me,

Psa 139:2 you know when I sit, when I rise, you understand my thoughts from afar.

Psa 139:3 You watch when I walk or lie down, you know every detail of my conduct.

Psa 139:4 A word is not yet on my tongue before you, Yahweh, know all about it.

Psa 139:5 You fence me in, behind and in front, you have laid your hand upon me.

Psa 139:6 Such amazing knowledge is beyond me, a height to which I cannot attain.

Psa 139:7 Where shall I go to escape your spirit? Where shall I flee from your presence?

Psa 139:8 If I scale the heavens you are there, if I lie flat in Sheol, there you are.

Psa 139:9 If I speed away on the wings of the dawn, if I dwell beyond the ocean,

Psa 139:10 even there your hand will be guiding me, your right hand holding me fast.

Psa 139:1 1 I will say, “Let the darkness cover me, and the night wrap itself around me”,

Psa 139:12 even darkness to you is not dark, and night is as clear as the day.

Psa 139:13 You created my inmost self, knit me together in my mother’s womb.

Psa 139:14 For so many marvels I thank you; a wonder am I, and all your works are wonders. You knew me
through and through,

Psa 139:15 my being held no secrets from you, when I was being formed in secret, textured in the depths of the
earth.

Psa 139:16 Your eyes could see my embryo. In your book all my days were inscribed, every one that was fixed
is there.

Psa 139:17 How hard for me to grasp your thoughts, how many, God, there are!

Psa 139:18 If I count them, they are more than the grains of sand; if I come to an end, I am still with you.

Psa 139:19 If only, God, you would kill the wicked !-Men of violence, keep away from me!-
Psa 1 39:20 those who speak blasphemously about you, and take no account of your thoughts.

Psa 139:21 Yahweh, do I not hate those who hate you, and loathe those who defy you?

Psa 139:22 My hate for them has no limits, I regard them as my own enemies.

Psa 139:23 God, examine me and know my heart, test me and know my concerns.

Psa 1 39:24 Make sure that I am not on my way to ruin, and guide me on the road of eternity.

Psa 140:1 [For the choirmaster Psalm Of David] Rescue me, Yahweh, from evil men, protect me from violent
men,

Psa 140:2 whose heart is bent on malice, day after day they harbour strife;

Psa 140:3 their tongues as barbed as a serpent’s, viper’s venom behind their lips. Pause

Psa 140:4 Keep me, Yahweh, from the clutches of the wicked, protect me from violent men, who are bent on

making me stumble, laying out snares where I walk,

Psa 140:5 in their arrogance hiding pitfall and nooseto trap me as I pass. Pause

Psa 140:6 I said to Yahweh, “You are my God”. Listen, Yahweh, to the sound of my prayer.

Psa 140:7 Yahweh my Lord, my saving strength, you shield my head when battle comes.

Psa 140:8 Yahweh, do not grant the wicked their wishes, do not let their plots succeed. Pause Do not let my

attackers

Psa 140:9 prevail, but let them be overwhelmed by their own malice.

Psa 140:10 May red-hot embers rain down on them, may they be flung into the mire once and for all.

Psa 140:1 1 May the slanderer find no rest anywhere, may evil hunt down violent men implacably.

Psa 140:12 I know that Yahweh will give judgement for the wretched, justice for the needy.

Psa 140:13 The upright shall praise your name, the honest dwell in your presence.

Psa 141:1 [Psalm Of David] Yahweh, I am calling, hurry to me, listen to my voice when I call to you.

Psa 141 :2 May my prayer be like incense in your presence, my uplifted hands like the evening sacrifice.

Psa 141 :3 Yahweh, mount a guard over my mouth, a guard at the door of my lips.

Psa 141:4 Check any impulse to speak evil, to share the foul deeds of evil-doers. I shall not sample their
delights!

Psa 141 :5 May the upright correct me with a friend’s rebuke; but the wicked shall never anoint my head with oil,
for that would make me party to their crimes.

Psa 141 :6 They are delivered into the power of the rock, their judge, those who took pleasure in hearing me
say,

Psa 141 :7 “Like a shattered millstone on the ground our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol”.

Psa 141 :8 To you, Yahweh, I turn my eyes, in you I take refuge, do not leave me unprotected.

Psa 141 :9 Save me from the traps that are set for me, the snares of evil-doers.

Psa 141:10 Let the wicked fall each into his own net, while I pass on my way.
