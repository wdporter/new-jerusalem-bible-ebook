<h4>Nehemiah’s call: his mission to Judah (1:1–2:10)</h4>

<p>The words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah.</p>

<p>It happened in the month of Chislev, in the twentieth year, while I was in the citadel of Susa, that Hanani, one of my brothers, arrived with some men from Judah. I asked them about the Jews — those who had escaped and those who survived from the captivity — and about Jerusalem. They replied, “The survivors remaining there in the province since the captivity are in a very bad and demoralised condition: the walls of Jerusalem are in ruins and its gates have been burnt down”. On hearing this I sat down and wept; for some days I mourned, fasting and praying before the God of heaven.</p>

<p>I said, “Yahweh, God of heaven — the great and awe-inspiring God who keeps a covenant of faithful love with those who love him and obey his commandments — let your ear be attentive and your eyes open, to listen to your servant’s prayer, which I now offer to you day and night on behalf of your servants the Israelites. I admit the sins of the Israelites, which we have committed against you. Both I and my father’s House have sinned; we have acted very wickedly towards you by not keeping the commandments, laws and rulings which you enjoined on your servant Moses. Remember, I beg you, the promise which you solemnly made to your servant Moses, ‘If you are unfaithful, I shall scatter you among the peoples; but if you come back to me and keep my commandments and practise them, even though those who have been banished are at the very sky’s end, I shall gather them from there and bring them back to the place which I have chosen as a dwelling-place for my name’. Since they are your servants, your people, whom you have redeemed with your mighty power and strong hand, O Lord, let your ear now be attentive to your servant’s prayer and to the prayer of your servants who want to revere your name. I beg you let your servant be successful today and win this man’s compassion”.</p>

<p>At the time I was cupbearer to the king.</p>

<p>In the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, since I was in charge of the wine, I took the wine and offered it to the king. Now, he had never seen me looking depressed before. So the king said to me, “Why are you looking depressed? You are not sick! This must be a sadness of the heart”.</p>

<p>Thoroughly alarmed by this, I said to the king, “May the king live for ever! How can I not look depressed when the city where the tombs of my ancestors are lies in ruins and its gates have been burnt down?”.</p>

<p>The king then said to me, “What would you like me to do?”.</p>

<p>Praying to the God of heaven, I said to the king, “If the king approves and your servant enjoys your favour, send me to Judah, to the city of the tombs of my ancestors, so that I can rebuild it”.</p>

<p>The king — with the queen sitting beside him — said, “How long will your journey take, and when will you come back?”. Once I had given him a definite time, the king approved my mission.</p>

<p>I then said to the king, “If the king approves, may I be given orders for the governors of Transeuphrates to let me pass through on my way to Judah? Also an order for Asaph, keeper of the king’s forest, to supply me with timber for the beams of the gates of the citadel of the Temple, for the city walls and for the house which I am to occupy?”. These the king granted me because the kindly hand of my God was over me.</p>

<p>When I reached the governors of Transeuphrates, I gave them the king’s orders. The king had sent an escort of army officers and cavalry along with me.</p>

<p>When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the official of Ammon heard about this, they were exceedingly displeased that someöne had come to promote the welfare of the Israelites.</p>

<h4>The decision to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem (2:11–20)</h4>

<p>And so I reached Jerusalem. After I had been there three days, I got up during the night with a few other men — I had not told anyone what my God had inspired me to do for Jerusalem — taking no animal with me other than my own mount. Under cover of dark I went out through the Valley Gate towards the Dragon’s Fountain as far as the Dung Gate, and examined the wall of Jerusalem where it was broken down and its gates burnt out. I then crossed to the Fountain Gate and the King’s Pool, but it was impassable to my mount. So I went up the Valley in the dark, examining the wall; I then went in again through the Valley Gate, coming back without the officials knowing where I had gone or what I had been doing. So far I had said nothing to the Jews: neither to the priests, the nobles, the officials nor any other persons involved in the undertaking.</p>

<p>I then said to them, “You see what a sorry state we are in: Jerusalem is in ruins and its gates have been burnt down. Come on, we must rebuild the walls of Jerusalem and put an end to our humiliating position!”. And I told them how the kindly hand of my God had been over me, and the words which the king had said to me.</p>

<p>At this they said, “Let us start building at once!”, and they set their hands to the good work.</p>

<p>When Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the official of Ammon, and Geshem the Arab heard about this, they laughed at us and jeered. They said, “What is this you are doing? Are you going to revolt against the king?”.</p>

<p>But I gave them this answer, “The God of heaven will grant us success and we, his servants, mean to start building; as for you, you have neither share nor right nor memorial in Jerusalem”.</p>

<h4>How the walls were rebuilt (3:1–32)</h4>

<p>Eliashib the high priest with his brother priests then set to work and rebuilt the Sheep Gate; they made the framework, hung its doors, fixed its bolts and bars and proceeded as far as the Tower of the Hundred and the Tower of Hananel. The men of Jericho built next to him; Zaccur son of Imri built next to them. The sons of Ha-Senaah rebuilt the Fish Gate; they made the framework, hung its doors and fixed its bolts and bars. Meremoth son of Uriah, son of Hakkoz, carried out repairs next to them; Meshullam son of Berechiah, son of Meshezabel, carried out repairs next to him; and Zadok son of Baana carried out repairs next to him. The men of Tekoa carried out repairs next to him, though their nobles would not demean themselves to help their masters. Joiada son of Paseah and Meshullam son of Besodeiah repaired the gate of the New Quarter; they made the framework, hung its doors and fixed its bolts and bars. Next to them repairs were carried out by Melatiah of Gibeon, Jadon of Meronoth, and the men of Gibeon and Mizpah, for the sake of the governor of Transeuphrates. Next to them repairs were carried out by Uzziel son of Harhaiah, a member of the metal-workers’ guild, and next to him repairs were carried out by Hananiah of the perfumers’ guild. These renovated the wall of Jerusalem as far as the Broad Wall.</p>

<p>Next to them repairs were carried out by Rephaiah son of Hur, who was head of one half of the district of Jerusalem. Next to them Jedaiah son of Harumaph carried out repairs opposite his own house; next to him repairs were carried out by Hattush son of Hashabneiah. Malchijah son of Harim and Hasshub son of Pahath-Moab repaired another section as far as the Furnace Tower. Next to them repairs were carried out by Shallum son of Hallohesh, head of the other half of the district of Jerusalem, by him and his sons. Hanun and the inhabitants of Zanoah repaired the Valley Gate: they rebuilt it, hung its doors and fixed its bolts and bars; they also repaired a thousand cubits of wall up to the Dung Gate. Malchijah son of Rechab, head of the district of Beth-ha-Cherem, repaired the Dung Gate; he rebuilt it, hung its doors and fixed its bolts and bars.</p>

<p>Shallum son of Col-Hozeh, head of the district of Mizpah, repaired the Fountain Gate; he rebuilt it, roofed it, hung its doors and fixed its bolts and bars. He also rebuilt the wall of the Pool of Siloah, adjoining the king’s garden, as far as the steps going down from the City of David. After him, Nehemiah son of Azbuk, head of half the district of Beth-Zur, carried out repairs from a point opposite the Davidic Tombs to the artificial pool and the House of the Champions. After him, repairs were carried out by the Levites: Rehum son of Bani; and next to him Hashabiah, head of one half of the district of Keilah, carried out repairs for his own district. After him, repairs were carried out by their brothers: Binnui son of Henadad, head of the other half of the district of Keilah. Next to him, Ezer son of Jeshua, headman of Mizpah, repaired another section in front of the ascent to the armoury at the Angle.</p>

<p>After him, Baruch son of Zabbai repaired another section from the Angle to the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest. After him, Meremoth son of Uriah, son of Hakkoz, repaired another section from the door of Eliashib’s house as far as the end of Eliashib’s house. And after him repairs were carried out by the priests who lived in the district. After them repairs were carried out by Benjamin and Hasshub, opposite their own house. After them repairs were carried out by Azariah son of Maaseiah, son of Ananiah, beside his own house. After him, Binnui son of Henadad repaired another section from Azariah’s house as far as the Angle at the corner. After him, Palal son of Uzai carried out repairs in front of the Angle and the tower projecting from the king’s Upper Palace by the Court of the Guard; and after him, Pedaiah son of Parosh carried out the repairs to a point by the Water Gate to the east and the projecting tower. After him, the men of Tekoa repaired another section from in front of the great projecting tower as far as the wall of Ophel.</p>

<p>From the Horse Gate onwards repairs were carried out by the priests, each in front of his own house. After them repairs were carried out by Zadok son of Immer in front of his house, and after him repairs were carried out by Shemaiah son of Shechaniah, keeper of the East Gate. After him Hananiah son of Shelemiah and Hanun sixth son of Zalaph repaired another section, after whom repairs were carried out by Meshullam son of Berechiah in front of his room. After him Malchijah, of the metal-workers’ guild, repaired as far as the Hall of the temple slaves and merchants, in front of the Muster Gate, as far as the upper room at the corner. And between the upper room at the corner and the Sheep Gate repairs were carried out by the goldsmiths and the merchants.</p>

<h4>The effect on the Jews’s opponents (3:33–4:17)</h4>

<p>When Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became furiously angry. He ridiculed the Jews and in front of his kinsmen and the aristocracy of Samaria he exclaimed, “What are these pathetic Jews doing? Are they going to give up? Or offer sacrifices? Or complete the work in a day? Can they put new life into stones taken from rubbish heaps and even charred?”.</p>

<p>And beside him Tobiah of Ammon remarked, “If a jackal were to jump on what they are building, it would knock their stone wall down!”. Listen, our God, for we are despised! Make their sneers fall back on their own heads! Send them as booty to a land of captivity! Do not pardon their wickedness, may their sin never be erased before you, for they have insulted the builders to their face!</p>

<p>Meanwhile we were rebuilding the wall, which was soon joined up all the way around to mid-height; the people put their hearts into the work.</p>

<p>When Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites and the Ashdodites heard that repairs to the walls of Jerusalem were going forward — that the gaps were beginning to fill up — they became very angry, and they all plotted to come and attack Jerusalem and upset my plans.</p>

<p>We, however, prayed to our God and organised a guard day and night to protect the city from them. But in Judah the saying went, “The strength of the carrier falters, the rubbish heap is so vast that by ourselves we cannot rebuild the wall!”.</p>

<p>And our opponents said, “They will never know or see a thing, until we are in there among them, and then we shall massacre them and put a stop to the work”.p>

<p>Now when the Jews who lived near them had warned us ten times over, “They are coming up against us from every place they live in”, men took up position in the space behind the wall at those points where it was lowest, and I organised the people by families with their swords, spears and bows.</p>

<p>Aware of their anxiety, I then addressed the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, “Do not be afraid of them. Remember the great and awe-inspiring Lord and fight for your kinsmen, your sons, your daughters, your wives and your homes”. Once our enemies heard that we were forewarned and that God had thwarted their plan, they withdrew and we all went back to the wall, each one to his work.</p>

<p>From then on, half my own retainers went on working, while the other half stood by, armed with spears, shields, bows and armour to protect the whole House of Judah as they rebuilt the wall. The carriers were armed, working with one hand and holding a spear in the other. Each builder had his sword strapped to his side as he built. Beside me stood a trumpeter. I then said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, “The work is great and widely spread out, and we are deployed along the wall some way from one another. Rally to us wherever you hear the trumpet sounding; our God will fight for us”. And so we went on with the work from break of day until the stars came out. At the same time I also told the people, “Let every man, with his attendant, spend the night inside Jerusalem; we shall spend the night on guard and the day at work”. Neither I, nor my brothers, nor my attendants, nor my bodyguards, ever took off our clothes; each one kept his spear in his right hand.</p>

<h4>The social problems of Nehemiah. He vindicates his administration (5:1–19)</h4>

<p>There was a great outcry from the people, and from their wives, against their brother Jews. Some said, “We are having to pledge our sons and daughters to get enough grain to eat and keep us alive”.</p>

<p>Others said, “We are having to mortgage our fields, our vineyards and our houses to get grain because of the shortage”.</p>

<p>Still others said, “We have had to borrow money on our fields and our vineyards to pay the royal tax; and though we belong to the same race as our brothers, and our children are as good as theirs, we shall have to sell our sons and our daughters into slavery; some of our daughters have been sold into slavery already. We can do nothing about it, since our fields and our vineyards now belong to others”.</p>

<p>When I heard their complaints and these words I was very angry. Having turned the matter over in my mind, I reprimanded the nobles and the officials as follows, “Each of you is imposing a burden on his brother”. Summoning a great assembly to deal with them, I said to them, “To the best of our power, we have redeemed our brother Jews who were forced to sell themselves to foreigners, and now you in turn are selling your brothers, for them to be bought back by us!”. They were silent and could find nothing to say. “What you are doing”, I went on, “is wrong. Do you not want to walk in the fear of our God and escape the sneers of the nations, our enemies? I too, with my brothers and retainers, have lent them money and grain. Let us cancel these pledges. This very day return them their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves and their houses, and cancel the claim on the money, grain, new wine and olive oil, which you have lent them”.</p>

<p>“We shall make restitution”, they replied, “we shall claim nothing more from them; we shall do as you say”. Summoning the priests, I then made them swear to do as they had promised. Then, shaking out the fold of my garment, I said, “May God thus shake out of house and possessions anyone who does not make good this promise; may he be shaken out thus and left empty!”.</p>

<p>And the whole assembly answered, “Amen” and praised Yahweh. And the people kept this promise.</p>

<p>What is more, from the time when the king appointed me to be their governor in Judah, from the twentieth to the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, for twelve years, neither I nor my brothers ever levied the governor’s subsistence allowance, whereäs the former governors, my predecessors, had been a burden on the people, from whom they took forty silver shekels a day for food and wine, while their attendants oppressed the people too. But I, fearing God, never did this. Also, not acquiring any land, I concentrated on the work of this wall and all my attendants joined in the work together, too.</p>

<p>Furthermore, magistrates and officials to the number of a hundred and fifty ate at my table, not to mention those who came to us from the surrounding nations. Every day, one ox, six fine sheep, as well as poultry, were prepared for me; every ten days, skins of wine were brought in bulk. But even so, I never claimed the governor’s subsistence allowance, since the people already had burden enough to bear.</p>

<p>To my credit, my God, remember all I have done for this people.</p>

<h4>The intrigues of Nehemiah’s enemies. The wall is finished (6:1–7:3)</h4>

<p>When Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab and our other enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall and that not a single gap was left — though at that time I had not fixed the doors to the gates — Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message, “Come and meet us at Ha-Chephirim in the Vale of Ono”. But they had evil designs on me.</p>

<p>So I sent messengers to them to say, “I am engaged in a great undertaking, so I cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?”. Four times they sent me the same invitation and I made them the same reply. The fifth time, with the same purpose in mind, Sanballat sent me his servant bearing an open letter.</p>

<p>It ran, “There is a rumour among the nations — and Gashmu confirms it — that you and the Jews are thinking of rebelling, which is why you are rebuilding the wall, and you intend to become their king; and that you have even briefed prophets to acclaim you in Jerusalem with the cry, ‘There is a king in Judah!’. Now, these rumours are going to reach the king; so you had better come and discuss them with us”.</p>

<p>To this I sent him the following reply, “As regards what you say, nothing of the sort has occurred; it is a figment of your own imagination”.</p>

<p>For they were all trying to terrorise us, thinking, “They will become demoralised over the work and it will not get finished”. But my morale rose even higher.</p>

<p>Then, when I went to visit Shemaiah son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, since he was prevented from coming to me, he said:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>We must gather at the Temple of God,</span><br />
		<span class="i1">inside the sanctuary itself;</span><br />
		<span>we must shut the sanctuary doors,</span><br />
		<span class="i1">for they are coming to kill you,</span>
		<span>they are coming to kill you tonight!</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I retorted, “Should a man like me run away? Would a man like me go into the Temple to save his life? I shall not go in!”. I realised that God had not sent him to say this, but that he had produced this prophecy for me because Tobiah was paying him to terrorise me into doing as he said and committing a sin, so that they would have grounds for blackening my reputation and blaming me.</p>

<p>Remember Tobiah, my God, for what he did; and Noadiah the prophetess, and the other prophets who tried to terrorise me.</p>

<p>The wall was finished within fifty-two days, on the twenty-fifth of Elul. When all our enemies heard about it and all the surrounding nations saw it, they thought it a wonderful thing, because they realised that this work had been accomplished by the power of our God.</p>

<p>During this same period, the nobles of Judah kept sending letter after letter to Tobiah, and letters from Tobiah kept arriving for them; for he had many sworn to his interest in Judah, since he was son-in-law to Shecaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah. They even cried up his good deeds in my presence, and they reported what I said back to him. And Tobiah kept sending letters to terrorise me.</p>

<p>Now, when the wall had been rebuilt and I had hung the doors, the gatekeepers (the singers and the Levites) were then appointed. I entrusted the administration of Jerusalem to my brother Hanani, and to Hananiah the commander of the citadel, for he was a more trustworthy, God-fearing man than many others. I said to them, “The gates of Jerusalem must not be opened until the sun gets hot; and the doors must be shut and barred before it begins to go down. Detail guards from the residents of Jerusalem, each to his post, in front of his own house”.</p>

<h4>The repopulation of Jerusalem (7:4–5)</h4>

<p>The city was large and spacious but the population was small, and the houses had not been rebuilt. My God then inspired me to assemble the nobles, the officials and the people for the purpose of taking a census by families. I discovered the genealogical register of those who had returned in the first group, and there I found entered:</p>

<h4>List of the first exiles to return (7:6–72)</h4>

<p>These are the people of the province who returned from the captivity of the Exile, those whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had deported, and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own town. They were the ones who arrived with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah.</p>

<p>The number of the men of the people of Israel: sons of Parosh, two thousand one hundred and seventy-two; sons of Shephatiah, three hundred and seventy-two; sons of Arah, six hundred and fifty-two; sons of Pahath-Moab, that is to say sons of Jeshua and Joab, two thousand eight hundred and eighteen; sons of Elam, one thousand two hundred and fifty-four; sons of Zattu, eight hundred and forty-five; sons of Zaccai, seven hundred and sixty; sons of Binnui, six hundred and forty-eight; sons of Bebai, six hundred and twenty-eight; sons of Azgad, two thousand three hundred and twenty-two; sons of Adonikam, six hundred and sixty-seven; sons of Bigvai, two thousand and sixty-seven; sons of Adin, six hundred and fifty-five; sons of Ater, that is to say of Hezekiah, ninety-eight; sons of Hashum, three hundred and twenty-eight; sons of Bezai, three hundred and twenty-four; sons of Hariph, one hundred and twelve; sons of Gibeon, ninety-five; men of Bethlehem and Netophah, one hundred and eighty-eight; men of Anathoth, one hundred and twenty-eight; men of Beth-Azmaveth, forty-two; men of Kiriath-Jearim, Chephirah and Beeroth, seven hundred and forty-three; men of Ramah and Geba, six hundred and twenty-one; men of Michmas, one hundred and twenty-two; men of Bethel and Ai, one hundred and twenty-three; men of the other Nebo, fifty-two; sons of the other Elam, one thousand two hundred and fifty-four; sons of Harim, three hundred and twenty; sons of Jericho, three hundred and forty-five; sons of Lod, Hadid and Ono, seven hundred and twenty-one; sons of Senaah, three thousand nine hundred and thirty.</p>

<p>The priests: sons of Jedaiah, of the House of Jeshua, nine hundred and seventy-three; sons of Immer, one thousand and fifty-two; sons of Pashhur, one thousand two hundred and forty-seven; sons of Harim, one thousand and seventeen.</p>

<p>The Levites: sons of Jeshua, of Kadmiel, of the sons of Hodiah, seventy-four.</p>

<p>The singers: sons of Asaph, one hundred and forty-eight.</p>

<p>The gatekeepers: sons of Shallum, sons of Ater, sons of Talmon, sons of Akkub, sons of Hatita, sons of Shobai, one hundred and thirty-eight.</p>

<p>The temple slaves: sons of Ziha, sons of Hasupha, sons of Tabbaoth, sons of Keros, sons of Sia, sons of Padon, sons of Lebana, sons of Hagaba, sons of Shalmai, sons of Hanan, sons of Giddel, sons of Gahar, sons of Reaiah, sons of Rezin, sons of Nekoda, sons of Gazzam, sons of Uzza, sons of Paseah, sons of Besai, sons of the Meunites, sons of the Nephusites, sons of Bakbuk, sons of Hakupha, sons of Harhur, sons of Bazlith, sons of Mehida, sons of Harsha, sons of Barkos, sons of Sisera, sons of Temah, sons of Nezaiah, sons of Hatipha.</p>

<p>The sons of Solomon’s slaves: sons of Sotai, sons of Sophereth, sons of Perida, sons of Jaala, sons of Darkon, sons of Giddel, sons of Shephatiah, sons of Hattil, sons of Pochereth-ha-Zebaim, sons of Amon. The total of the temple slaves and the sons of Solomon’s slaves: three hundred and ninety-two.</p>

<p>The following, who came from Tel-Melah, Tel-Harsha, Cherub, Addon and Immer, could not prove that their families and ancestry were of Israelite origin: the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda: six hundred and forty-two. And among the priests: the sons of Hobaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, the sons of Barzillai — who had married one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, whose name he adopted. These had looked for their entries in the official genealogies but were not to be found there, and were hence disqualified from the priesthood. Consequently, His Excellency forbade them to eat any of the consecrated food until a priest appeared who could consult <i>urim</i> and <i>thummim</i>.</p>

<p>The whole assembly numbered forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty people, not counting their slaves and maidservants to the number of seven thousand three hundred and thirty-seven. They also had two hundred and forty-five male and female singers. They had four hundred and thirty-five camels and six thousand seven hundred and twenty donkeys.</p>

<p>A certain number of heads of families contributed to the work. His Excellency contributed one thousand gold drachmas, fifty bowls, and thirty priestly robes to the fund. And heads of families gave twenty thousand gold drachmas and two thousand two hundred silver minas to the work fund. The gifts made by the rest of the people amounted to twenty thousand gold drachmas, two thousand silver minas, and sixty-seven priestly robes.</p>

<p>The priests, the Levites and some of the people lived in Jerusalem and thereäbouts; the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple slaves in their appropriate towns; and all the other Israelites, in their own towns.</p>

<h4>Judaism is born. Ezra reads the Law. The feast of Shelters (7:73–8:18)</h4>

<p>Now when the seventh month came around — the Israelites being in their towns — all the people gathered as one man in the square in front of the Water Gate, and asked the scribe Ezra to bring the Book of the Law of Moses which Yahweh had prescribed for Israel. Accordingly, on the first day of the seventh month, the priest Ezra brought the Law before the assembly, consisting of men, women and all those old enough to understand. In the square in front of the Water Gate, in the presence of the men and women, and of those old enough to understand, he read from the book from dawn until noon; all the people listened attentively to the Book of the Law.</p>

<p>The scribe Ezra stood on a wooden dais erected for the purpose; beside him stood, on his right, Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah and Maaseiah; on his left, Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam. In full view of all the people — since he stood higher than them all — Ezra opened the book; and when he opened it, all the people stood up. Then Ezra blessed Yahweh, the great God, and all the people raised their hands and answered, “Amen! Amen!”; then they bowed down and, face to the ground, prostrated themselves before Yahweh. And Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabab, Hanan, Pelaiah, who were Levites, explained the Law to the people, while the people all kept their places. Ezra read from the book of the Law of God, translating and giving the sense; so the reading was understood.</p>

<p>	Then His Excellency Nehemiah and the priest-scribe Ezra and the Levites who were instructing the people said to all the people, “Today is sacred to Yahweh your God. Do not be mournful, do not weep”. For the people were all in tears as they listened to the words of the Law.</p>

<p>He then said, “You may go; eat what is rich, drink what is sweet and send a helping to the man who has nothing prepared. For today is sacred to our Lord. Do not be sad: the joy of Yahweh is your stronghold”.</p>

<p>And the Levites calmed all the people down, saying, “Keep quiet; this is a sacred day. Do not be sad”. Then all the people went off to eat and drink and give helpings away and enjoy themselves to the full, since they had understood the meaning of what had been proclaimed to them.</p>

<p>On the second day, the heads of families of the whole people, and the priests and Levites, gathered around the scribe Ezra to study the words of the Law. And written in the Law that Yahweh had prescribed through Moses they found that the Israelites were to live in shelters during the feast of the seventh month. So they issued a proclamation and had it circulated in all their towns and in Jerusalem: “Go into the hills and bring branches of olive, pine, myrtle, palm and other leafy trees to make shelters, as it says in the book”. The people went out; they brought branches and made shelters for themselves, each man on his roof, in their courtyards, in the precincts of the Temple of God, in the square of the Water Gate and in the square of the Ephraim Gate. The whole assembly, all who had returned from the captivity, put up shelters and lived in them; this the Israelites had not done from the days of Joshua son of Nun until that day, and there was very great merrymaking.</p>

<p>Each day, from the first day to the last one, Ezra read from the Book of the Law of God. They celebrated the feast for seven days; on the eighth day, as prescribed, they held a solemn assembly.</p>

<h4>The ceremony of expiation (9:1–37)</h4>

<p>On the twenty-fourth day of this month the Israelites, in sackcloth and with dust on their heads, assembled for a fast. Then those of Israelite stock who had severed relations with all foreigners stood up and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their ancestors. Standing, each man in his place, they read from the Book of the Law of Yahweh their God for one quarter of the day; for another quarter they confessed their sins and worshipped Yahweh their God. On the Levites’ platform stood Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani and Chenani, calling to Yahweh their God in ringing tones. The Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah and Pethahiah said, “Stand up and bless Yahweh your God!</p>

	<span>To all of them you give life,</span><br />
	<span>and the array of heaven worships you.</span>

	<span>“You are Yahweh God,</span><br />
	<span>who chose Abram,</span><br />

	<span>and changed his name to Abraham.</span><br />
	<span>Finding his heart was faithful to you,</span><br />

	<span>“You saw the distress of our ancestors in Egypt,</span><br />
	<span>you heard their cry by the Sea of Reeds.</span><br />
	<span>You displayed signs and wonders against Pharaoh,</span><br />
	<span>against all his servants and all the people of his land;</span><br />
	<span>for you knew how arrogantly they treated them.</span><br />
	<span>You won a reputation which you keep to this day.</span><br />
	<span>You opened up the sea in front of them:</span><br />
	<span>they walked on dry ground right through the sea.</span><br />
	<span>Into the depths you hurled their pursuers</span><br />
	<span>like a stone into the raging waters.</span><br />
	<span>With a pillar of cloud you led them by day,</span><br />
	<span>with a pillar of fire by night:</span><br />
	<span>to light the way ahead of them</span><br />
	<span>by which they were to go.</span><br />
	<span>You came down on Mount Sinai</span><br />
	<span>and spoke with them from heaven;</span><br />
	<span>you gave them right rules, reliable laws,</span><br />
	<span>good statutes and commandments;</span><br />
	<span>you revealed your holy Sabbath to them; </span><br />
	<span>you laid down commandments, statutes and law for them</span><br />
	<span>through your servant Moses.</span><br />
	<span>For their hunger you gave them bread from heaven,</span><br />
	<span>for their thirst you brought them water out of a rock,</span><br />
	<span>and you told them to go in and take possession of the country</span><br />
	<span>which you had sworn to give them.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>“But they and our ancestors acted arrogantly,</span><br />
	<span>grew obstinate and flouted your commands.</span><br />
	<span>They refused to obey,</span><br />

	<span>they grew obstinate</span><br />
	<span>and made up their minds to return</span><br />
	<span>to their slavery in Egypt.</span><br />
	<span>But because you are a forgiving God,</span><br />
	<span>gracious and compassionate,</span><br />
	<span>patient and rich in faithful love,</span><br />
	<span>you did not abandon them!</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>“Even when they cast themselves a calf out of molten metal</span><br />
	<span>and said, ‘This is your God</span><br />
	<span>who brought you up from Egypt!’</span><br />
	<span>and committed monstrous impieties,</span><br />
	<span>you, in your great compassion,</span><br />
	<span>did not abandon them in the desert:</span><br />
	<span>the pillar of cloud did not leave them,</span><br />
	<span>leading them on their path by day,</span><br />
	<span>nor the pillar of fire by night,</span><br />
	<span>lighting the way ahead of them</span><br />

	<span>For forty years you cared for them in the desert,</span><br />
	<span>so that they went short of nothing,</span><br />
	<span>their clothes did not wear out,</span><br />
	<span>nor were their feet swollen.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>“You gave them kingdoms and peoples,</span><br />

	<span>with their kings and the peoples of the country,</span><br />

	<span>they captured fortified towns</span><br />

	<span>to bring them back to you,</span><br />
	<span>and committed monstrous impieties.</span><br />
	<span>So you put them at the mercy of their enemies</span><br />

	<span>But when they were being oppressed and called to you,</span><br />

	<span>you gave them deliverers</span><br />
	<span>who rescued them from their oppressors’ clutches.</span><br />
	<span>But once at peace again,</span><br />
	<span>again they did what was wrong before you;</span><br />
	<span>so you put them at the mercy of their enemies</span><br />

	<span>When they called to you again,</span><br />
	<span>you heard them from heaven</span><br />

	<span>in whose observance is life;</span><br />
	<span>they turned a stubborn shoulder,</span><br />
	<span>were obstinate, and disobeyed.</span><br />
	<span>You were patient with them for many years</span><br />
	<span>and warned them by your spirit</span><br />
	<span>through your prophets,</span><br />

	<span>so you put them at the mercy of the people of the country.</span><br />

	<span>which has befallen us, our kings, our princes,</span><br />
	<span>our priests, our prophets, and all your people</span><br />
	<span>from the times of the Assyrian kings</span><br />
	<span>to the present day.</span><br />
	<span>You have been upright</span><br />
	<span>in all that has happened to us,</span><br />
	<span>for you acted faithfully,</span><br />
	<span>while we did wrong.</span><br />
	<span>Our kings, our princes, our priests</span><br />

	<span>or pay attention to your commandments and obligations</span><br />
	<span>which you imposed upon them.</span><br />
	<span>Even in their own kingdom,</span><br />
	<span>despite your great goodness</span><br />
	<span>which you bestowed on them,</span><br />
	<span>despite the wide and fertile country</span><br />
	<span>which you had lavished on them,</span><br />
	<span>they did not serve you</span><br />
	<span>or renounce their evil deeds.</span><br />
	<span>See, we are slaves today,</span><br />
	<span>slaves in the country which you gave to our ancestors</span><br />

	<span>Its abundant produce goes to the kings</span><br />
	<span>whom, for our sins, you have set over us,</span><br />
	<span>who rule over our persons</span><br />
	<span>and over our cattle as they please.</span><br />
	<span>We are in great distress”.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>A record of promises made by the community (10:1–40)</h4>

<p>In view of all this we make a firm agreement, in writing. Our princes, our Levites, our priests and the rest of the people have put their names to the document under seal.</p>

<p>On the sealed document were the names of: Nehemiah, son of Hacaliah, and Zedekiah; Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah, Pashhur, Amariah, Malchijah, Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch, Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah, Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch, Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin, Maaziah, Bilgai, Shemaiah: these were the priests.</p>

<p>The Levites were: Jeshua son of Azaniah, Binnui of the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel, and their kinsmen Shebaniah, Hodaviah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan, Mica, Rehob, Hashabiah, Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah, Hodiah, Bani, Chenani.</p>

<p>The leaders of the people were: Parosh, Pahath-Moab, Elam, Zattu, Bani, Bunni, Azgad, Bebai, Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin, Ater, Hezekiah, Azzur, Hodiah, Hashum, Bezai, Hariph, Anathoth, Nebai, Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir, Meshezabel, Zadok, Jaddua, Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah, Hoshea, Hananiah, Hasshub, Hallohesh, Pilha, Shobek, Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah, Ahijah, Hanan, Anan, Malluch, Harim, Baanah.</p>

<p>And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the temple slaves and all those who had severed relations with the people of the country to adhere to the law of God, as also their wives, their sons, their daughters, that is, all those who had reached the age of discretion, have joined their esteemed brothers in a solemn oath to follow the law of God given through Moses, servant of God, and to observe and practise all the commandments of Yahweh our Lord, with his rules and his statutes.</p>

<p>We will not give our daughters in marriage to the peoples of the country, nor allow their daughters to marry our sons.</p>

<p>If the people of the country bring goods or foodstuff of any kind to sell on the Sabbath day, we will buy nothing from them on Sabbath or holy day.</p>

<p>In the seventh year, we will forgo the produce of the soil and the exaction of all debts.</p>

<p>We recognise the following obligations:</p>

<p>to give one-third of a shekel yearly for the service of the Temple of our God: for the loaves of permanent offering, for the perpetual oblation, for the perpetual burnt offering, for the sacrifices on Sabbaths, on New Moons and on festivals, for the consecrated gifts, the sin offerings to expiate for Israel, in short, for the whole work of the Temple of our God;</p>

<p>and further, to bring yearly to the Temple of our God the first-fruits of our soil and the first-fruits of all our orchards, also the first-born of our sons and of our cattle, as the law prescribes, the first-born of our herds and flocks should be taken to the Temple of our God for the priests officiating in the Temple of our God. Furthermore, we shall bring the best of our dough, of every kind of fruit, of the new wine and of the oil to the priests, to the storerooms of the Temple of our God, and the tithe on our soil to the Levites — the Levites will themselves collect the tithes from all the towns of our religion. An Aaronite priest will accompany the Levites when they collect the tithes, and the Levites will bring a tenth part of the tithes to the Temple of our God, into the treasury storerooms; for these rooms are where	the Israelites and the Levites are to bring the contributions of corn, wine and oil, and where the vessels of the sanctuary are, and the officiating priests, the gatekeepers and the singers.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as regards deliveries of wood for burning on the altar of our God as the law prescribes, we have arranged, by drawing lots, how these deliveries are to be made at the Temple of our God by the priests, the Levites and the people by families, at stated times every year.</p>

<p>We will no longer neglect the Temple of our God.</p>

<h4>Nehemiah’s method of repopulating Jerusalem (11:1–3)</h4>

<p>Now the leaders of the people took up residence in Jerusalem; so the rest of the people drew lots: one man in ten was to come and live in Jerusalem, the holy city, while the other nine were to stay in the towns outside. The people praised all those who volunteered to live in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>In the towns of Judah each man lived on his own property, but these are the provincial leaders, the Israelites, the priests, the Levites, the temple slaves and the descendants of Solomon’s slaves, who made their homes in Jerusalem:</p>

<h4>The Jewish population at Jerusalem (11:4–18)</h4>

<p>Of the sons of Judah and the sons of Benjamin who made their homes in Jerusalem there were:</p>

<p>Of the sons of Judah: Athaiah son of Uzziah, son of Zechariah, son of Amariah, son of Shephatiah, son of Mehalalel, of the descendants of Perez; and Maaseiah son of Baruch, son of Col-Hozeh, son of Hazaiah, son of Adaiah, son of Joiarib, son of Zechariah, descendant of Shelah. The total number of the descendants of Perez living in Jerusalem was four hundred and sixty-eight outstanding people.</p>

<p>These are the sons of Benjamin: Sallu son of Meshullam, son of Joed, son of Pedaiah, son of Kolaiah, son of Maaseiah, son of Ithiel, son of Jeshaiah, and his brothers Gabbai and Sallai; nine hundred and twenty-eight.</p>

<p>Joel son of Zichri was their chief, and Judah son of Hassenuah was second in command of the city.</p>

<p>Of the priests there were Jedaiah son of Joiakim, son of Seraiah, son of Hilkiah, son of Meshullam, son ofZadok, son of Meraioth, son of Ahitub, the chief of the Temple of God, and their kinsmen who performed the Temple liturgy: eight hundred and twenty-two; Adaiah son of Jeroham, son of Pelaliah, son of Amzi, son of Zechariah, son of Pashhur, son of Malchijah, and his kinsfolk, heads of families: two hundred and forty-two; and Amashai son of Azarel, son of Ahzai, son of Meshillemoth, son of Immer, and his kinsfolk, outstanding people: one hundred and twenty-eight.</p>

<p>Their chief was Zabdiel son of Haggadol.</p>

<p>Of the Levites there were Shemaiah son of Hasshub, son of Azrikam, son of Hashabiah, son of Bunni; Shabbethai and Jozabad, the levitical leaders responsible for work outside the Temple of God; Mattaniah son of Mica, son of Zabdi, son of Asaph, who led the praises and intoned the thanksgiving associated with the prayer, Bakbukiah being his junior colleague; and Obadiah son of Shammua, son of Galal, son of Jeduthun. The total number of Levites in the holy city was two hundred and eighty-four.</p>

<h4>Supplementary notes (11:19, 21–24)</h4>

<p>The gatekeepers: Akkub, Talmon and their kinsmen, who kept watch at the gates: one hundred and seventy-two.</p>

<p>The temple slaves lived on Ophel; Ziha and Gishpa were in charge of the temple slaves. The official in charge of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi son of Bani, son of Hashabiah, son of Mattaniah, son of Mica, of the sons of Asaph, who led the singing in the liturgy of the Temple of God; for the singers were under royal orders, with regulations laying down what was required of them day by day. Petahiah son of Meshezabel, of the sons of Zerah son of Judah, was the king’s minister for all matters connected with the people.</p>

<h4>The Jewish population outside Jerusalem (11:20, 25–36)</h4>

<p>The rest of Israel, including the priests and Levites, made their homes throughout the towns of Judah, each man on his own inheritance, and in the villages near their lands. Some of the sons of Judah made their homes in Kiriath-Arba and its dependencies, Dibon and its dependencies, Jekabzeel and its dependencies, Jeshua, Moladah, Beth-Pelet, Hazar-Shual, Beersheba and its dependencies, Ziklag, Meconah and its dependencies, En-Rimmon, Zorah, Jarmuth, Zanoah, Adullam and their villages, Lachish and its lands, and Azekah and its dependencies; thus, they settled from Beersheba as far as the Valley of Hinnom.</p>

<p>And some Benjaminites made their homes in Geba, Michmash, Aija, Bethel and its dependencies, Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah, Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim, Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat, Lod, Ono and the Valley of Craftsmen.</p>

<p>Some levitical groups lived in Judah, some in Benjamin.</p>

<h4>Priests and Levites who returned under Zerubbabel and Jeshua (12:1–9)</h4>

<p>These are the priests and the Levites who came back with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua:</p>

<p>Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra, Amariah, Malluch, Hattush, Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth, Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah, Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah, Shemaiah, and Joiarib, Jedaiah, Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah — these were the heads of the priests and their kinsmen in the days of Jeshua.</p>

<p>The Levites were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, Mattaniah — this last, with his brothers, was in charge of the songs of praise, while Bakbukiah and Unno, their colleagues, formed the alternate choir to theirs.</p>

<h4>Genealogical list of high priests (12:10–11)</h4>

<p>Jeshua fathered Joiakim, Joiakim fathered Eliashib, Eliashib fathered Joiada, Joiada fathered Johanan, and Johanan fathered Jaddua.</p>

<h4>Priests and Levites in the time of the High Priest Joiakim (12:12–26)</h4>

<p>In the days of Joiakim the heads of the priestly families were: family of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah; of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan; of Malluch, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph; of Harim, Adna; of Meremoth, Helkai; of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam; of Abijah, Zichri; of Minjamin, of Moadiah, Piltai; of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan; and of Jojarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi; of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber; of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel.</p>

<p>In the time of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan and Jaddua, the heads of the families of priests were registered in the Book of Chronicles, up to the reign of Darius the Persian.</p>

<p>The Levites who were heads of families were registered in the Book of Chronicles up to the time of Johanan, grandson of Eliashib.</p>

<p>The heads of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, while their brothers who formed an alternate choir for the hymns of praise and thanksgiving, as David, man of God, had prescribed, section corresponding to section, were Mattaniah, Bakbukiah and Obadiah. Meshullam, Talmon and Akkub were the gatekeepers guarding the stores at the gates.</p>

<p>These lived in the days of Joiakim son of Jeshua, son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and of Ezra the priest-scribe.</p>

<h4>The dedication of the wall of Jerusalem (12:27–43)</h4>

<p>At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem the Levites were sent for, wherever they lived, to come to Jerusalem and joyfully perform the dedication with hymns of thanksgiving and songs to the accompaniment of cymbals, lyres and harps. Accordingly, the levitical singers assembled from the district around Jerusalem, from the villages of the Netophathites, from Beth-Gilgal and from their farms at Geba and Azmaveth — for the singers had built themselves villages all around Jerusalem. When the priests and Levites had purified themselves, they then purified the people, the gates and the wall.</p>

<p>I then made the leaders of Judah come on to the top of the wall and appointed two large choirs. One made its way along the top of the wall, to the right, towards the Dung Gate; bringing up the rear were Hoshaiah and half the leaders of Judah, and also Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah and Jeremiah, of the priests, with trumpets; then Zechariah son of Jonathan, son of Shemaiah, son of Mattaniah, son of Micaiah, son of Zaccur, son of Asaph, with his kinsmen, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Juda, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David, man of God. The scribe Ezra walked at their head. At the Fountain Gate they went straight on up the steps of the City of David, along the top of the rampart by the stairway of the wall, above the Palace of David as far as the Water Gate, on the east.</p>

<p>The other choir made its way to the left; I and half the leaders of the people followed them along the top of the wall from the Tower of the Furnaces to the Broad Wall, from the Ephraim Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred as far as the Sheep Gate, and they came to a halt at the Prison Gate.</p>

<p>The two choirs then took their places in the Temple of God. But I had half the magistrates with me as well as the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, Hananiah with the trumpets, and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam and Ezer. The singers sang loudly under the direction of Jezrahiah. There were great sacrifices offered that day and the people rejoiced, God having given them good cause for rejoicing; the women and children rejoiced too, and the joy of Jerusalem could be heard from far away.</p>

<h4>A golden age (12:44–13:3)</h4>

<p>For the rooms intended for the treasures, contributions, first-fruits and tithes, supervisors were then appointed whose business it was to collect in them those portions from the town lands awarded by the Law to the priests and Levites. For Judah rejoiced in the officiating priests and Levites, since they — with the singers and gatekeepers — performed the liturgy of their God and the rites of purification as ordained by David and his son Solomon. For from ancient times, from the days of David and Asaph, they had been the leaders in rendering hymns of praise and thanksgiving to God. In the days of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah, all Israel supplied regular daily portions for the singers and gatekeepers, and gave the dedicated contributions to the Levites; and the Levites gave the dedicated contributions to the Aaronites.</p>

<p>At that time they were reading to the people from the Book of Moses, when they found this written in it, “No Ammonite or Moabite is to be admitted to the assembly of God, and this is for all time, since they did not come to meet the Israelites with bread and water, and even hired Balaam to oppose them by cursing them; but our God turned the curse into a blessing”. Having heard the Law, they excluded all foreigners from Israel.</p>

<h4>The second mission of Nehemiah (13:4–31)</h4>

<p>Earlier, Eliashib the priest, who was in charge of the rooms of the Temple of our God, and who was close to Tobiah, had provided him with a large room where they previously used to store the meal offerings, incense, utensils, tithes of corn, wine and oil, that is, the part of the Levites, singers and gatekeepers, and the contributions for the priests. While all this was going on I was away from Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I had gone to see the king. But after some time I asked the king for permission to leave, and returned to Jerusalem, where I learned about the crime which Eliashib had committed for Tobiah’s benefit, by providing him with a room in the courts of the Temple of God. I was extremely displeased and threw all Tobiah’s household goods out of the room and into the street. I then gave orders for the room to be purified, and had the utensils of the Temple of God, the meal offerings and the incense, all replaced.</p>

<p>I also learned that the Levites had not been receiving their allocations, as a result of which the Levites and singers who performed the liturgy had all withdrawn to their farms. I then reprimanded the officials. “Why is the Temple of God deserted?”, I asked. And I collected them together again and brought them back to their posts; and all Judah then delivered the tithe of corn, wine and oil to the storehouses. As supervisors of the storehouses I appointed Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, Pedaiah one of the Levites and, as their assistant, Hanan son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah, since they were considered reliable people; their duty was to make the distributions to their kinsmen.</p>

<p>Remember me for this, my God, and do not blot out the good deeds which I have done for the Temple of my God and its observances!</p>

<p>At the same time I saw people in Judah treading the winepress, bringing in sacks of grain and loading donkeys on the Sabbath; they were also bringing wine, grapes, figs and every kind of merchandise into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. So I forbade them to sell the food. Tyrians living there were bringing in fish and every kind of merchandise which they were selling to the Judaeans on the Sabbath in Jerusalem itself. So I also reprimanded the leading men of Judah, saying to them, “What a wicked way to behave, profaning the Sabbath day! Was this not exactly what your ancestors did, with the result that our God brought all this misery down on us and on this city? And now you are adding to the wrath hanging over Israel by profaning the Sabbath yourselves!”. So when the gates of Jerusalem were getting dark at the approach of the Sabbath, I gave orders for the doors to be shut and directed that they were not to be opened again until the Sabbath was over. I stationed some of my attendants at the gates to make sure that no merchandise was brought in on the Sabbath day. So the traders and dealers in goods of all kinds spent the night outside Jerusalem once or twice, until I reprimanded them. I said to them, “Why are you spending the night in front of the wall? Do it again, and I shall use force on you”. After this, they did not come on the Sabbath. I then ordered the Levites to purify themselves and act as guards at the gates, so that the Sabbath day might be kept holy.</p>

<p>Remember this also to my credit, have pity on me in the greatness of your faithful love.</p>

<p>At that time too, I saw Jews who had married wives from Ashdod, Ammon and Moab; as regards their children, half of them spoke the language of Ashdod or the language of one of the other peoples, but could no longer speak the language of Judah. I reprimanded them, I cursed them, I struck several of them and tore out their hair and adjured them by God, “You are not to give your daughters in marriage to their sons or let their daughters marry your sons, or marry them yourselves! Was it not because of women like these that Solomon king of Israel sinned? Although among many nations there was no king like him and he was loved by his God, and God made him king of all Israel, even then foreign women led him into sinning! Were you obedient when you committed this very grave crime: breaking faith with our God by marrying foreign wives?”.</p>

<p>One of the sons of Jehoiada, son of Eliashib the high priest, was a son-in-law of Sanballat the Horonite; I drove him from my presence.</p>

<p>Remember them, my God, for having defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priests and Levites!</p>

<p>And so I purged them of everything foreign; I drew up regulations for the priests and Levites, defining each man’s duty, as well as for the deliveries of wood at the proper times, and for the first-fruits.</p>

<p>Remember this, my God, to my credit!</p>
