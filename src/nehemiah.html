Neh 1:1 The words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah. It happened in the month of Chislev, in the twentieth year,
while I was in the citadel of Susa,

Neh 1 :2 that Hanani, one of my brothers, arrived with some men from Judah. I asked them about the Jews —
those who had escaped and those who survived from the captivity — and about Jerusalem.

Neh 1:3 They replied, The survivors remaining there in the province since the captivity are in a very bad and
demoralised condition: the walls of Jerusalem are in ruins and its gates have been burnt down”.

Neh 1 :4 On hearing this I sat down and wept; for some days I mourned, fasting and praying before the God of
heaven.

Neh 1:5 I said, “Yahweh, God of heaven — the great and awe-inspiring God who keeps a covenant of faithful
love with those who love him and obey his commandments-

Neh 1 :6 let your ear be attentive and your eyes open, to listen to your servant’s prayer, which I now offer to you
day and night on behalf of your servants the Israelites. I admit the sins of the Israelites, which we have
committed against you. Both I and my father’s House have sinned;

Neh 1:7 we have acted very wickedly towards you by not keeping the commandments, laws and rulings which
you enjoined on your servant Moses.

Neh 1 :8 Remember, I beg you, the promise which you solemnly made to your servant Moses, ‘If you are
unfaithful, I shall scatter you among the peoples;

Neh 1 :9 but if you come back to me and keep my commandments and practise them, even though those who
have been banished are at the very sky’s end, I shall gather them from there and bring them back to the place
which I have chosen as a dwelling-place for my name’.

Neh 1:10 Since they are your servants, your people, whom you have redeemed with your mighty power and
strong hand,

Neh 1:11 O Lord, let your ear now be attentive to your servant’s prayer and to the prayer of your servants who
want to revere your name. I beg you let your servant be successful today and win this man’s compassion”. At the
time I was cupbearer to the king.

Neh 2:1 In the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes, since I was in charge of the wine, I took
the wine and offered it to the king. Now, he had never seen me looking depressed before.

Neh 2:2 So the king said to me, “Why are you looking depressed? You are not sick! This must be a sadness of
the heart”. Thoroughly alarmed by this,

Neh 2:3 I said to the king, “May the king live for ever! How can I not look depressed when the city where the
tombs of my ancestors are lies in ruins and its gates have been burnt down?”.

Neh 2:4 The king then said to me, “What would you like me to do?”. Praying to the God of heaven,

Neh 2:5 I said to the king, “If the king approves and your servant enjoys your favour, send me to Judah, to the
city of the tombs of my ancestors, so that I can rebuild it”.

Neh 2:6 The king — with the queen sitting beside him-said, “How long will your journey take, and when will you
come back?”. Once I had given him a definite time, the king approved my mission.

Neh 2:7 I then said to the king, “If the king approves, may I be given orders for the governors of Transeuphrates
to let me pass through on my way to Judah?

Neh 2:8 Also an order for Asaph, keeper of the king’s forest, to supply me with timber for the beams of the gates
of the citadel of the Temple, for the city walls and for the house which I am to occupy?”. These the king granted
me because the kindly hand of my God was over me.

Neh 2:9 When I reached the governors of Transeuphrates, I gave them the king’s orders. The king had sent an
escort of army officers and cavalry along with me.

Neh 2:10 When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the official of Ammon heard about this, they were
exceedingly displeased that someöne had come to promote the welfare of the Israelites.

Neh 2:1 1 And so I reached Jerusalem. After I had been there three days,

Neh 2:12 I got up during the night with a few other men — 1 had not told anyone what my God had inspired me to
do for Jerusalem — taking no animal with me other than my own mount.

Neh 2:13 Under cover of dark I went out through the Valley Gate towards the Dragon’s Fountain as far as the
Dung Gate, and examined the wall of Jerusalem where it was broken down and its gates burnt out.

Neh 2:14 I then crossed to the Fountain Gate and the King’s Pool, but it was impassable to my mount.

Neh 2:15 So I went up the Valley in the dark, examining the wall; I then went in again through the Valley Gate,
coming back

Neh 2:16 without the officials knowing where I had gone or what I had been doing. So far I had said nothing to
the Jews: neither to the priests, the nobles, the officials nor any other persons involved in the undertaking.

Neh 2:17 I then said to them, “You see what a sorry state we are in: Jerusalem is in ruins and its gates have
been burnt down. Come on, we must rebuild the walls of Jerusalem and put an end to our humiliating position!”.



Neh 2:18 And I told them how the kindly hand of my God had been over me, and the words which the king had
said to me. At this they said, “Let us start building at once!”. and they set their hands to the good work.

Neh 2:19 When Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the official of Ammon, and Geshem the Arab heard about this,
they laughed at us and jeered. They said, “What is this you are doing? Are you going to revolt against the king?”.
Neh 2:20 But I gave them this answer, “The God of heaven will grant us success and we, his servants, mean to
start building; as for you, you have neither share nor right nor memorial in Jerusalem”.

Neh 3:1 Eliashib the high priest with his brother priests then set to work and rebuilt the Sheep Gate; they made
the framework, hung its doors, fixed its bolts and bars and proceeded as far as the Tower of the Hundred and
the Tower of Hananel.

Neh 3:2 The men of Jericho built next to him; Zaccur son of Imri built next to them.

Neh 3:3 The sons of Ha-Senaah rebuilt the Fish Gate; they made the framework, hung its doors and fixed its
bolts and bars.

Neh 3:4 Meremoth son of Uriah, son of Hakkoz, carried out repairs next to them; Meshullam son of Berechiah,
son of Meshezabel, carried out repairs next to him; and Zadok son of Baana carried out repairs next to him.

Neh 3:5 The men of Tekoa carried out repairs next to him, though their nobles would not demean themselves to
help their masters.

Neh 3:6 Joiada son of Paseah and Meshullam son of Besodeiah repaired the gate of the New Quarter; they
made the framework, hung its doors and fixed its bolts and bars.

Neh 3:7 Next to them repairs were carried out by Melatiah of Gibeon, Jadon of Meronoth, and the men of
Gibeon and Mizpah, for the sake of the governor of Transeuphrates.

Neh 3:8 Next to them repairs were carried out by Uzziel son of Harhaiah, a member of the metal-workers’ guild,
and next to him repairs were carried out by Hananiah of the perfumers’ guild. These renovated the wall of
Jerusalem as far as the Broad Wall.

Neh 3:9 Next to them repairs were carried out by Rephaiah son of Hur, who was head of one half of the district
of Jerusalem.

Neh 3:10 Next to them Jedaiah son of Harumaph carried out repairs opposite his own house; next to him repairs
were carried out by Hattush son of Hashabneiah.

Neh 3:1 1 Malchijah son of Harim and Hasshub son of Pahath-Moab repaired another section as far as the
Furnace Tower.

Neh 3:12 Next to them repairs were carried out by Shallum son of Hallohesh, head of the other half of the
district of Jerusalem, by him and his sons.

Neh 3:13 Hanun and the inhabitants of Zanoah repaired the Valley Gate: they rebuilt it, hung its doors and fixed
its bolts and bars; they also repaired a thousand cubits of wall up to the Dung Gate.

Neh 3:14 Malchijah son of Rechab, head of the district of Beth-ha-Cherem, repaired the Dung Gate; he rebuilt it,
hung its doors and fixed its bolts and bars.

Neh 3:15 Shallum son of Col-Hozeh, head of the district of Mizpah, repaired the Fountain Gate; he rebuilt it,
roofed it, hung its doors and fixed its bolts and bars. He also rebuilt the wall of the Pool of Siloah, adjoining the
king’s garden, as far as the steps going down from the City of David.

Neh 3:16 After him, Nehemiah son of Azbuk, head of half the district of Beth-Zur, carried out repairs from a point
opposite the Davidic Tombs to the artificial pool and the House of the Champions.

Neh 3:17 After him, repairs were carried out by the Levites: Rehum son of Bani; and next to him Hashabiah,
head of one half of the district of Keilah, carried out repairs for his own district.

Neh 3:18 After him, repairs were carried out by their brothers: Binnui son of Henadad, head of the other half of
the district of Keilah.

Neh 3:19 Next to him, Ezer son of Jeshua, headman of Mizpah, repaired another section in front of the ascent
to the armoury at the Angle.

Neh 3:20 After him, Baruch son of Zabbai repaired another section from the Angle to the door of the house of
Eliashib the high priest.

Neh 3:21 After him, Meremoth son of Uriah, son of Hakkoz, repaired another section from the door of Eliashib’s
house as far as the end of Eliashib’s house.

Neh 3:22 And after him repairs were carried out by the priests who lived in the district.

Neh 3:23 After them repairs were carried out by Benjamin and Hasshub, opposite their own house. After them
repairs were carried out by Azariah son of Maaseiah, son of Ananiah, beside his own house.

Neh 3:24 After him, Binnui son of Henadad repaired another section from Azariah’s house as far as the Angle at
the corner.

Neh 3:25 After him, Palal son of Uzai carried out repairs in front of the Angle and the tower projecting from the
king’s Upper Palace by the Court of the Guard; and after him, Pedaiah son of Parosh carried out the repairs
Neh 3:26 to a point by the Water Gate to the east and the projecting tower.

Neh 3:27 After him, the men of Tekoa repaired another section from in front of the great projecting tower as far



as the wall of Ophel.

Neh 3:28 From the Horse Gate onwards repairs were carried out by the priests, each in front of his own house.
Neh 3:29 After them repairs were carried out by Zadok son of Immer in front of his house, and after him repairs
were carried out by Shemaiah son of Shechaniah, keeper of the East Gate.

Neh 3:30 After him Hananiah son of Shelemiah and Hanun sixth son of Zalaph repaired another section, after
whom repairs were carried out by Meshullam son of Berechiah in front of his room.

Neh 3:31 After him Malchijah, of the metal-workers’ guild, repaired as far as the Hall of the temple slaves and
merchants, in front of the Muster Gate, as far as the upper room at the corner.

Neh 3:32 And between the upper room at the corner and the Sheep Gate repairs were carried out by the
goldsmiths and the merchants.

Neh 3:33 When Sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became furiously angry.

Neh 3:34 He ridiculed the Jews and in front of his kinsmen and the aristocracy of Samaria he exclaimed, “What
are these pathetic Jews doing … ? Are they going to give up? Or offer sacrifices? Or complete the work in a
day? Can they put new life into stones taken from rubbish heaps and even charred?”.

Neh 3:35 And beside him Tobiah of Ammon remarked, “If a jackal were to jump on what they are building, it

would knock their stone wall down!”.

Neh 3:36 Listen, our God, for we are despised! Make their sneers fall back on their own heads! Send them as
booty to a land of captivity!

Neh 3:37 Do not pardon their wickedness, may their sin never be erased before you, for they have insulted the
builders to their face!

Neh 3:38 Meanwhile we were rebuilding the wall, which was soon joined up all the way round to mid-height; the
people put their hearts into the work.

Neh 4:1 When Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites and the Ashdodites heard that repairs to the walls
of Jerusalem were going forward — that the gaps were beginning to fill up — they became very angry,

Neh 4:2 and they all plotted to come and attack Jerusalem and upset my plans.

Neh 4:3 We, however, prayed to our God and organised a guard day and night to protect the city from them.

Neh 4:4 But in Judah the saying went, “The strength of the carrier falters, the rubbish heap is so vast that by
ourselves we cannot rebuild the wall!”.

Neh 4:5 And our opponents said, “They will never know or see a thing, until we are in there among them, and
then we shall massacre them and put a stop to the work”.

Neh 4:6 Now when the Jews who lived near them had warned us ten times over, “They are coming up against
us from every place they live in”,

Neh 4:7 men took up position in the space behind the wall at those points where it was lowest, and I organised
the people by families with their swords, spears and bows.

Neh 4:8 Aware of their anxiety, I then addressed the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, “Do not be
afraid of them. Remember the great and awe-inspiring Lord and fight for your kinsmen, your sons, your
daughters, your wives and your homes”.

Neh 4:9 Once our enemies heard that we were forewarned and that God had thwarted their plan, they withdrew
and we all went back to the wall, each one to his work.

Neh 4:10 From then on, half my own retainers went on working, while the other half stood by, armed with
spears, shields, bows and armour to protect the whole House of Judah as they rebuilt the wall.

Neh 4:1 1 The carriers were armed, working with one hand and holding a spear in the other.

Neh 4:12 Each builder had his sword strapped to his side as he built. Beside me stood a trumpeter.

Neh 4:13 I then said to the nobles, the officials and the rest of the people, “The work is great and widely spread
out, and we are deployed along the wall some way from one another.

Neh 4:14 Rally to us wherever you hear the trumpet sounding; our God will fight for us”.

Neh 4:15 And so we went on with the work from break of day until the stars came out.

Neh 4:16 At the same time I also told the people, “Let every man, with his attendant, spend the night inside
Jerusalem; we shall spend the night on guard and the day at work”.

Neh 4:17 Neither I, nor my brothers, nor my attendants, nor my bodyguards, ever took off our clothes; each one
kept his spear in his right hand.

Neh 5:1 There was a great outcry from the people, and from their wives, against their brother Jews.

Neh 5:2 Some said, “We are having to pledge our sons and daughters to get enough grain to eat and keep us
alive”.

Neh 5:3 Others said, “We are having to mortgage our fields, our vineyards and our houses to get grain because
of the shortage”.

Neh 5:4 Still others said, “We have had to borrow money on our fields and our vineyards to pay the royal tax;
Neh 5:5 and though we belong to the same race as our brothers, and our children are as good as theirs, we
shall have to sell our sons and our daughters into slavery; some of our daughters have been sold into slavery



already. We can do nothing about it, since our fields and our vineyards now belong to others”.

Neh 5:6 When I heard their complaints and these words I was very angry.

Neh 5:7 Having turned the matter over in my mind, I reprimanded the nobles and the officials as follows, “Each
of you is imposing a burden on his brother”. Summoning a great assembly to deal with them,

Neh 5:8 I said to them, “To the best of our power, we have redeemed our brother Jews who were forced to sell
themselves to foreigners, and now you in turn are selling your brothers, for them to be bought back by us!”. They
were silent and could find nothing to say.

Neh 5:9 “What you are doing”, I went on, “is wrong. Do you not want to walk in the fear of our God and escape
the sneers of the nations, our enemies?

Neh 5:10 I too, with my brothers and retainers, have lent them money and grain. Let us cancel these pledges.
Neh 5:1 1 This very day return them their fields, their vineyards, their olive groves and their houses, and cancel
the claim on the money, grain, new wine and olive oil, which you have lent them”.

Neh 5:12 “We shall make restitution”, they replied, “we shall claim nothing more from them; we shall do as you
say”. Summoning the priests, I then made them swear to do as they had promised.

Neh 5:13 Then, shaking out the fold of my garment, I said, “May God thus shake out of house and possessions
anyone who does not make good this promise; may he be shaken out thus and left empty!”. And the whole
assembly answered, “Amen” and praised Yahweh. And the people kept this promise.

Neh 5:14 What is more, from the time when the king appointed me to be their governor in Judah, from the
twentieth to the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, for twelve years, neither I nor my brothers ever levied the
governor’s subsistence allowance,

Neh 5:15 whereäs the former governors, my predecessors, had been a burden on the people, from whom they
took forty silver shekels a day for food and wine, while their attendants oppressed the people too. But I, fearing
God, never did this.

Neh 5:16 Also, not acquiring any land, I concentrated on the work of this wall and all my attendants joined in the
work together, too.

Neh 5:17 Furthermore, magistrates and officials to the number of a hundred and fifty ate at my table, not to
mention those who came to us from the surrounding nations.

Neh 5:18 Every day, one ox, six fine sheep, as well as poultry, were prepared for me; every ten days, skins of
wine were brought in bulk. But even so, I never claimed the governor’s subsistence allowance, since the people
already had burden enough to bear.

Neh 5:19 To my credit, my God, remember all I have done for this people.

Neh 6:1 When Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab and our other enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall and
that not a single gap was left — though at that time I had not fixed the doors to the gates-

Neh 6:2 Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message, “Come and meet us at Ha-Chephirim in the Vale of Ono”.
But they had evil designs on me.

Neh 6:3 So I sent messengers to them to say, “I am engaged in a great undertaking, so I cannot come down.
Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?”.

Neh 6:4 Four times they sent me the same invitation and I made them the same reply.

Neh 6:5 The fifth time, with the same purpose in mind, Sanballat sent me his servant bearing an open letter.

Neh 6:6 It ran, “There is a rumour among the nations — and Gashmu confirms it — that you and the Jews are
thinking of rebelling, which is why you are rebuilding the wall, and you intend to become their king;

Neh 6:7 and that you have even briefed prophets to acclaim you in Jerusalem with the cry, ‘There is a king in
Judah!’. Now, these rumours are going to reach the king; so you had better come and discuss them with us”.

Neh 6:8 To this I sent him the following reply, “As regards what you say, nothing of the sort has occurred; it is a
figment of your own imagination”.

Neh 6:9 For they were all trying to terrorise us, thinking, “They will become demoralised over the work and it will
not get finished”. But my morale rose even higher.

Neh 6:10 Then, when I went to visit Shemaiah son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, since he was prevented from
coming to me, he said: We must gather at the Temple of God, inside the sanctuary itself; we must shut the
sanctuary doors, for they are coming to kill you, they are coming to kill you tonight!

Neh 6:1 1 But I retorted, “Should a man like me run away? Would a man like me go into the Temple to save his
life? I shall not go in!”.

Neh 6:12 I realised that God had not sent him to say this, but that he had produced this prophecy for me
because Tobiah was paying him

Neh 6:13 to terrorise me into doing as he said and committing a sin, so that they would have grounds for
blackening my reputation and blaming me.

Neh 6:14 Remember Tobiah, my God, for what he did; and Noadiah the prophetess, and the other prophets
who tried to terrorise me.

Neh 6:15 The wall was finished within fifty-two days, on the twenty-fifth of Elul.



Neh 6:16 When all our enemies heard about it and all the surrounding nations saw it, they thought it a wonderful
thing, because they realised that this work had been accomplished by the power of our God.

Neh 6:17 During this same period, the nobles of Judah kept sending letter after letter to Tobiah, and letters from
Tobiah kept arriving for them;

Neh 6:18 for he had many sworn to his interest in Judah, since he was son-in-law to Shecaniah son of Arah,
and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berechiah.

Neh 6:19 They even cried up his good deeds in my presence, and they reported what I said back to him. And
Tobiah kept sending letters to terrorise me.

Neh 7:1 Now, when the wall had been rebuilt and I had hung the doors, the gatekeepers (the singers and the
Levites) were then appointed.

Neh 7:2 I entrusted the administration of Jerusalem to my brother Hanani, and to Hananiah the commander of
the citadel, for he was a more trustworthy, God-fearing man than many others.

Neh 7:3 I said to them, “The gates of Jerusalem must not be opened until the sun gets hot; and the doors must
be shut and barred before it begins to go down. Detail guards from the residents of Jerusalem, each to his post,
in front of his own house”.

Neh 7:4 The city was large and spacious but the population was small, and the houses had not been rebuilt.

Neh 7:5 My God then inspired me to assemble the nobles, the officials and the people for the purpose of taking
a census by families. I discovered the genealogical register of those who had returned in the first group, and
there I found entered:

Neh 7:6 These are the people of the province who returned from the captivity of the Exile, those whom
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had deported, and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own
town.

Neh 7:7 They were the ones who arrived with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani,
Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:

Neh 7:35 sons of Harim, three hundred and twenty;

Neh 7:36 sons of Jericho, three hundred and forty-five;

Neh 7:37 sons of Lod, Hadid and Ono, seven hundred and twenty-one;

Neh 7:38 sons of Senaah, three thousand nine hundred and thirty.

Neh 7:40 sons of Immer, one thousand and fifty-two;

Neh 7:41 sons of Pashhur, one thousand two hundred and forty-seven;



Neh 7:42 sons of Harim, one thousand and seventeen.

Neh 7:43 The Levites: sons of Jeshua, of Kadmiel, of the sons of Hodiah, seventy-four.

Neh 7:45 The gatekeepers: sons of Shallum, sons of Ater, sons of Talmon, sons of Akkub, sons of Hatita, sons

Neh 7:46 The temple slaves: sons of Ziha, sons of Hasupha, sons of Tabbaoth,

Neh 7:47 sons of Keros, sons of Sia, sons of Padon,

Neh 7:48 sons of Lebana, sons of Hagaba, sons of Shalmai,

Neh 7:49 sons of Hanan, sons of Giddel, sons of Gahar,

Neh 7:50 sons of Reaiah, sons of Rezin, sons of Nekoda,

Neh 7:55 sons of Barkos, sons of Sisera, sons of Temah,

Neh 7:56 sons of Nezaiah, sons of Hatipha.

Neh 7:57 The sons of Solomon’s slaves: sons of Sotai, sons of Sophereth, sons of Perida,

Neh 7:58 sons of Jaala, sons of Darkon, sons of Giddel,

Neh 7:59 sons of Shephatiah, sons of Hattil, sons of Pochereth-ha-Zebaim, sons of Amon.

Neh 7:60 The total of the temple slaves and the sons of Solomon’s slaves: three hundred and ninety-two.

Neh 7:61 The following, who came from Tel-Melah, Tel-Harsha, Cherub, Addon and Immer, could not prove that
their families and ancestry were of Israelite origin:

Neh 7:62 the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda: six hundred and forty-two.

Neh 7:63 And among the priests: the sons of Hobaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, the sons of Barzillai — who had
married one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, whose name he adopted.

Neh 7:64 These had looked for their entries in the official genealogies but were not to be found there, and were
hence disqualified from the priesthood.

Neh 7:65 Consequently, His Excellency forbade them to eat any of the consecrated food until a priest appeared
who could consult urim and thummim.

Neh 7:66 The whole assembly numbered forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty people,

Neh 7:67 not counting their slaves and maidservants to the number of seven thousand three hundred and thirty-
seven. They also had two hundred and forty-five male and female singers.

Neh 7:68 They had four hundred and thirty-five camels and six thousand seven hundred and twenty donkeys.
Neh 7:69 A certain number of heads of families contributed to the work. His Excellency contributed one
thousand gold drachmas, fifty bowls, and thirty priestly robes to the fund.

Neh 7:70 And heads of families gave twenty thousand gold drachmas and two thousand two hundred silver
minas to the work fund.

Neh 7:71 The gifts made by the rest of the people amounted to twenty thousand gold drachmas, two thousand
silver minas, and sixty-seven priestly robes.

Neh 7:72 The priests, the Levites and some of the people lived in Jerusalem and thereabouts; the singers, the
gatekeepers, and the temple slaves in their appropriate towns; and all the other Israelites, in their own towns.
Now when the seventh month came round — the Israelites being in their towns-

Neh 8:1 all the people gathered as one man in the square in front of the Water Gate, and asked the scribe Ezra
to bring the Book of the Law of Moses which Yahweh had prescribed for Israel.

Neh 8:2 Accordingly, on the first day of the seventh month, the priest Ezra brought the Law before the
assembly, consisting of men, women and all those old enough to understand.

Neh 8:3 In the square in front of the Water Gate, in the presence of the men and women, and of those old
enough to understand, he read from the book from dawn until noon; all the people listened attentively to the Book
of the Law.

Neh 8:4 The scribe Ezra stood on a wooden dais erected for the purpose; beside him stood, on his right,
Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah and Maaseiah; on his left, Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum,
Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam.

Neh 8:5 In full view of all the people — since he stood higher than them all — Ezra opened the book; and when
he opened it, all the people stood up.

Neh 8:6 Then Ezra blessed Yahweh, the great God, and all the people raised their hands and answered, “Amen!
Amen!”; then they bowed down and, face to the ground, prostrated themselves before Yahweh.

Neh 8:7 And Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabab,
Hanan, Pelaiah, who were Levites, explained the Law to the people, while the people all kept their places.

Neh 8:8 Ezra read from the book of the Law of God, translating and giving the sense; so the reading was



understood,

Neh 8:9 Then His Excellency Nehemiah and the priest-scribe Ezra and the Levites who were instructing the
people said to all the people, “Today is sacred to Yahweh your God. Do not be mournful, do not weep”. For the
people were all in tears as they listened to the words of the Law.

Neh 8:10 He then said, “You may go; eat what is rich, drink what is sweet and send a helping to the man who
has nothing prepared. For today is sacred to our Lord. Do not be sad: the joy of Yahweh is your stronghold”.

Neh 8:1 1 And the Levites calmed all the people down, saying, “Keep quiet; this is a sacred day. Do not be sad”.
Neh 8:12 Then all the people went off to eat and drink and give helpings away and enjoy themselves to the full,
since they had understood the meaning of what had been proclaimed to them.

Neh 8:13 On the second day, the heads of families of the whole people, and the priests and Levites, gathered
round the scribe Ezra to study the words of the Law.

Neh 8:14 And written in the Law that Yahweh had prescribed through Moses they found that the Israelites were
to live in shelters during the feast of the seventh month.

Neh 8:15 So they issued a proclamation and had it circulated in all their towns and in Jerusalem: “Go into the
hills and bring branches of olive, pine, myrtle, palm and other leafy trees to make shelters, as it says in the book”.
Neh 8:16 The people went out; they brought branches and made shelters for themselves, each man on his roof,
in their courtyards, in the precincts of the Temple of God, in the square of the Water Gate and in the square of
the Ephraim Gate.

Neh 8:17 The whole assembly, all who had returned from the captivity, put up shelters and lived in them; this
the Israelites had not done from the days of Joshua son of Nun until that day, and there was very great
merrymaking.

Neh 8:18 Each day, from the first day to the last one, Ezra read from the Book of the Law of God. They
celebrated the feast for seven days; on the eighth day, as prescribed, they held a solemn assembly.

Neh 9:1 On the twenty-fourth day of this month the Israelites, in sackcloth and with dust on their heads,
assembled for a fast.

Neh 9:2 Then those of Israelite stock who had severed relations with all foreigners stood up and confessed their
sins and the iniquities of their ancestors.

Neh 9:3 Standing, each man in his place, they read from the Book of the Law of Yahweh their God for one
quarter of the day; for another quarter they confessed their sins and worshipped Yahweh their God.

Neh 9:4 On the Levites’ platform stood Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani and
Chenani, calling to Yahweh their God in ringing tones.

Neh 9:5 The Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah and Pethahiah said,
“Stand up and bless Yahweh your God! “Blessed are you, Yahweh our God from everlasting to everlasting, and
blessed be your glorious name, surpassing all blessing and praise!

Neh 9:6 “You, Yahweh, are the one, only Yahweh, you have created the heavens, the heaven of heavens and
all their array, the earth and all it bears, the seas and all they hold. To all of them you give life, and the array of
heaven worships you.

Neh 9:7 “You are Yahweh God, who chose Abram, brought him out of Ur in Chaldaea and changed his name to
Abraham.

Neh 9:8 Finding his heart was faithful to you, you made a covenant with him, to give the country of the
Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites and the Girgashites to him and his
descendants. And you have made good your promises, for you are upright.

Neh 9:9 “You saw the distress of our ancestors in Egypt, you heard their cry by the Sea of Reeds.

Neh 9:10 You displayed signs and wonders against Pharaoh, against all his servants and all the people of his
land; for you knew how arrogantly they treated them. You won a reputation which you keep to this day.

Neh 9:1 1 You opened up the sea in front of them: they walked on dry ground right through the sea. Into the
depths you hurled their pursuers like a stone into the raging waters.

Neh 9:12 With a pillar of cloud you led them by day, with a pillar of fire by night: to light the way ahead of them
by which they were to go.

Neh 9:13 You came down on Mount Sinai and spoke with them from heaven; you gave them right rules, reliable
laws, good statutes and commandments;

Neh 9:14 you revealed your holy Sabbath to them; you laid down commandments, statutes and law for them
through your servant Moses.

Neh 9:15 For their hunger you gave them bread from heaven, for their thirst you brought them water out of a
rock, and you told them to go in and take possession of the country which you had sworn to give them.

Neh 9:16 “But they and our ancestors acted arrogantly, grew obstinate and flouted your commands.

Neh 9:17 They refused to obey, forgetful of the wonders which you had worked for them; they grew obstinate
and made up their minds to return to their slavery in Egypt. But because you are a forgiving God, gracious and
compassionate, patient and rich in faithful love, you did not abandon them!



Neh 9:18 “Even when they cast themselves a calf out of molten metal and said, ‘This is your God who brought
you up from Egypt!’. and committed monstrous impieties,

Neh 9:19 you, in your great compassion, did not abandon them in the desert: the pillar of cloud did not leave
them, leading them on their path by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, lighting the way ahead of them by which
they were to go.

Neh 9:20 You gave them your good spirit to instruct them, you did not withhold your manna from their mouths,
you gave them water for their thirst.

Neh 9:21 For forty years you cared for them in the desert, so that they went short of nothing, their clothes did
not wear out, nor were their feet swollen.

Neh 9:22 “You gave them kingdoms and peoples, allotting them these as frontier lands; they occupied the
country of Sihon king of Heshbon, and the country of Og king of Bashan.

Neh 9:23 You gave them as many children as there are stars in the sky, and brought them into the country
which you had promised their ancestors that they would enter and possess.

Neh 9:24 The children entered and took possession of the country and before them you subdued the country’s
inhabitants, the Canaanites, whom you put at their mercy, with their kings and the peoples of the country, for
them to treat as they pleased;

Neh 9:25 they captured fortified towns and a fertile countryside, they took possession of houses stocked with all
kinds of goods, of storage-wells ready-hewn, of vineyards, olive groves and fruit trees in profusion; so they ate,
were full, grew fat and revelled in your great goodness.

Neh 9:26 “But they grew disobedient, rebelled against you and thrust your law behind their backs; they
slaughtered your prophets who had reproved them to bring them back to you, and committed monstrous
impieties.

Neh 9:27 So you put them at the mercy of their enemies who oppressed them. But when they were being
oppressed and called to you, you heard them from heaven and because of your great compassion you gave
them deliverers who rescued them from their oppressors’ clutches.

Neh 9:28 But once at peace again, again they did what was wrong before you; so you put them at the mercy of
their enemies who then became their rulers. When they called to you again, you heard them from heaven and,
because of your compassion, rescued them many times.

Neh 9:29 You warned them, to bring them back to your law, but they became arrogant, did not obey your
commandments and sinned against your rules, in whose observance is life; they turned a stubborn shoulder,
were obstinate, and disobeyed.

Neh 9:30 You were patient with them for many years and warned them by your spirit through your prophets, but
they would not listen; so you put them at the mercy of the people of the country.

Neh 9:31 But, because of your great compassion, you did not destroy them completely nor abandon them, for
you are a gracious, compassionate God.

Neh 9:32 Now, our God — the great God, the Mighty and Awe-inspiring One, maintaining the covenant and your
faithful love- count as no small thing this misery which has befallen us, our kings, our princes, our priests, our
prophets, and all your people from the times of the Assyrian kings to the present day.

Neh 9:33 You have been upright in all that has happened to us, for you acted faithfully, while we did wrong.

Neh 9:34 Our kings, our princes, our priests and our ancestors did not keep your law or pay attention to your
commandments and obligations which you imposed upon them.

Neh 9:35 Even in their own kingdom, despite your great goodness which you bestowed on them, despite the
wide and fertile country which you had lavished on them, they did not serve you or renounce their evil deeds.
Neh 9:36 See, we are slaves today, slaves in the country which you gave to our ancestors for them to eat the
good things it produces.

Neh 9:37 Its abundant produce goes to the kings whom, for our sins, you have set over us, who rule over our
persons and over our cattle as they please. We are in great distress”.

Neh 10:1 In view of all this we make a firm agreement, in writing. Our princes, our Levites, our priests and the
rest of the people have put their names to the document under seal.

Neh 10:2 On the sealed document were the names of: Nehemiah, son of Hacaliah, and Zedekiah;

Neh 10:3 Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah,

Neh 10:4 Pashhur, Amariah, Malchijah,

Neh 10:5 Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch,

Neh 10:6 Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah,

Neh 10:7 Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch,

Neh 10:8 Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin,

Neh 10:9 Maaziah, Bilgai, Shemaiah: these were the priests.

Neh 10:10 The Levites were: Jeshua son of Azaniah, Binnui of the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel,

Neh 10:1 1 and their kinsmen Shebaniah, Hodaviah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan,



Neh 10:12 Mica, Rehob, Hashabiah,

Neh 10:13 Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah,

Neh 10:14 Hodiah, Bani, Chenani.

Neh 10:15 The leaders of the people were: Parosh, Pahath-Moab, Elam, Zattu, Bani,

Neh 10:16 Bunni, Azgad, Bebai,

Neh 10:17 Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin,

Neh 10:18 Ater, Hezekiah, Azzur,

Neh 10:19 Hodiah, Hashum, Bezai,

Neh 10:20 Hariph, Anathoth, Nebai,

Neh 10:21 Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir,

Neh 10:22 Meshezabel, Zadok, Jaddua,

Neh 10:23 Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah,

Neh 10:24 Hoshea, Hananiah, Hasshub,

Neh 10:25 Hallohesh, Pilha, Shobek,

Neh 10:26 Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah,

Neh 10:27 Ahijah, Hanan, Anan,

Neh 10:28 Malluch, Harim, Baanah.

Neh 10:29 And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the temple slaves
and all those who had severed relations with the people of the country to adhere to the law of God, as also their
wives, their sons, their daughters, that is, all those who had reached the age of discretion,

Neh 1 0:30 have joined their esteemed brothers in a solemn oath to follow the law of God given through Moses,
servant of God, and to observe and practise all the commandments of Yahweh our Lord, with his rules and his
statutes.

Neh 1 0:31 We will not give our daughters in marriage to the peoples of the country, nor allow their daughters to
marry our sons.

Neh 1 0:32 If the people of the country bring goods or foodstuff of any kind to sell on the Sabbath day, we will
buy nothing from them on Sabbath or holy day. In the seventh year, we will forgo the produce of the soil and the
exaction of all debts.

Neh 10:33 We recognise the following obligations: to give one-third of a shekel yearly for the service of the
Temple of our God:

Neh 10:34 for the loaves of permanent offering, for the perpetual oblation, for the perpetual burnt offering, for
the sacrifices on Sabbaths, on New Moons and on festivals, for the consecrated gifts, the sin offerings to expiate
for Israel, in short, for the whole work of the Temple of our God;

Neh 1 0:35 Furthermore, as regards deliveries of wood for burning on the altar of our God as the law prescribes,
we have arranged, by drawing lots, how these deliveries are to be made at the Temple of our God by the priests,
the Levites and the people by families, at stated times every year. We will no longer neglect the Temple of our
God.

Neh 10:36 and further, to bring yearly to the Temple of our God the first-fruits of our soil and the first-fruits of all
our orchards,

Neh 10:37 also the first-born of our sons and of our cattle, as the law prescribes, the first-born of our herds and
flocks should be taken to the Temple of our God for the priests officiating in the Temple of our God.

Neh 1 0:38 Furthermore, we shall bring the best of our dough, of every kind of fruit, of the new wine and of the oil
to the priests, to the storerooms of the Temple of our God, and the tithe on our soil to the Levites — the Levites
will themselves collect the tithes from all the towns of our religion.

Neh 10:39 An Aaronite priest will accompany the Levites when they collect the tithes, and the Levites will bring
a tenth part

Neh 10:40 a, b of the tithes to the Temple of our God, into the treasury storerooms; for these rooms are where
the Israelites and the Levites are to bring the contributions of corn, wine and oil, and where the vessels of the
sanctuary are, and the officiating priests, the gatekeepers and the singers.

Neh 11:1 Now the leaders of the people took up residence in Jerusalem; so the rest of the people drew lots: one
man in ten was to come and live in Jerusalem, the holy city, while the other nine were to stay in the towns
outside.

Neh 1 1 :2 The people praised all those who volunteered to live in Jerusalem.

Neh 11:3 In the towns of Judah each man lived on his own property, but these are the provincial leaders, the
Israelites, the priests, the Levites, the temple slaves and the descendants of Solomon’s slaves, who made their
homes in Jerusalem:

Neh 1 1 :4 Of the sons of Judah and the sons of Benjamin who made their homes in Jerusalem there were: Of
the sons of Judah: Athaiah son of Uzziah, son of Zechariah, son of Amariah, son of Shephatiah, son of
Mehalalel, of the descendants of Perez;



Neh 1 1 :5 and Maaseiah son of Baruch, son of Col-Hozeh, son of Hazaiah, son of Adaiah, son of Joiarib, son of
Zechariah, descendant of Shelah.

Neh 1 1 :6 The total number of the descendants of Perez living in Jerusalem was four hundred and sixty-eight
outstanding people.

Neh 1 1 :7 These are the sons of Benjamin: Sallu son of Meshullam, son of Joed, son of Pedaiah, son of Kolaiah,
son of Maaseiah, son of Ithiel, son of Jeshaiah,

Neh 1 1 :8 and his brothers Gabbai and Sallai; nine hundred and twenty-eight.

Neh 1 1 :9 Joel son of Zichri was their chief, and Judah son of Hassenuah was second in command of the city.
Neh 11:10 Of the priests there were Jedaiah son of Joiakim, son of

Neh 11:11 Seraiah, son of Hilkiah, son of Meshullam, son ofZadok, son of Meraioth, son of Ahitub, the chief of
the Temple of God,

Neh 11:12 and their kinsmen who performed the Temple liturgy: eight hundred and twenty-two; Adaiah son of
Jeroham, son of Pelaliah, son of Amzi, son of Zechariah, son of Pashhur, son of Malchijah,

Neh 11:13 and his kinsfolk, heads of families: two hundred and forty-two; and Amashai son of Azarel, son of
Ahzai, son of Meshillemoth, son of Immer,

Neh 1 1:14 and his kinsfolk, outstanding people: one hundred and twenty-eight. Their chief was Zabdiel son of
Haggadol.

Neh 11:15 Of the Levites there were Shemaiah son of Hasshub, son of Azrikam, son of Hashabiah, son of
Bunni;

Neh 11:16 Shabbethai and Jozabad, the levitical leaders responsible for work outside the Temple of God;

Neh 11:17 Mattaniah son of Mica, son of Zabdi, son of Asaph, who led the praises and intoned the thanksgiving
associated with the prayer, Bakbukiah being his junior colleague; and Obadiah son of Shammua, son of Galal,
son of Jeduthun.

Neh 11:18 The total number of Levites in the holy city was two hundred and eighty-four.

Neh 11:19 The gatekeepers: Akkub, Talmon and their kinsmen, who kept watch at the gates: one hundred and
seventy-two.

Neh 1 1 :20 The rest of Israel, including the priests and Levites, made their homes throughout the towns of
Judah, each man on his own inheritance,

Neh 1 1 :21 The temple slaves lived on Ophel; Ziha and Gishpa were in charge of the temple slaves.

Neh 1 1 :22 The official in charge of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi son of Bani, son of Hashabiah, son of
Mattaniah, son of Mica, of the sons of Asaph, who led the singing in the liturgy of the Temple of God;

Neh 1 1 :23 for the singers were under royal orders, with regulations laying down what was required of them day
by day.

Neh 1 1 :24 Petahiah son of Meshezabel, of the sons of Zerah son of Judah, was the king’s minister for all
matters connected with the people.

Neh 1 1 :25 and in the villages near their lands. Some of the sons of Judah made their homes in Kiriath-Arba and
its dependencies, Dibon and its dependencies, Jekabzeel and its dependencies,

Neh 11:26 Jeshua, Moladah, Beth-Pelet,

Neh 1 1 .21 Hazar-Shual, Beersheba and its dependencies,

Neh 11:28 Ziklag, Meconah and its dependencies,

Neh 1 1 :29 En-Rimmon, Zorah, Jarmuth,

Neh 1 1 :30 Zanoah, Adullam and their villages, Lachish and its lands, and Azekah and its dependencies; thus,
they settled from Beersheba as far as the Valley of Hinnom.

Neh 1 1 :31 And some Benjaminites made their homes in Geba, Michmash, Aija, Bethel and its dependencies,
Neh 11:32 Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah,

Neh 11:33 Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim,

Neh 11:34 Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat,

Neh 1 1 :35 Lod, Ono and the Valley of Craftsmen.

Neh 1 1 :36 Some levitical groups lived in Judah, some in Benjamin.

Neh 12:1 These are the priests and the Levites who came back with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua:
Neh 12:2 Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,

Neh 12:3 Amariah, Malluch, Hattush, Shecaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,

Neh 12:4 Iddo, Ginnethoi, Abijah,

Neh 12:5 Mijamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,

Neh 12:6 Shemaiah, and Joiarib, Jedaiah,

Neh 1 2:7 Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah — these were the heads of the priests and their kinsmen in the days of
Jeshua.

Neh 12:8 The Levites were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, Mattaniah — this last, with his brothers,
was in charge of the songs of praise,



Neh 12:9 while Bakbukiah and Unno, their colleagues, formed the alternate choir to theirs.

Neh 12:10 Jeshua fathered Joiakim, Joiakim fathered Eliashib, Eliashib fathered Joiada,

Neh 12:1 1 Joiada fathered Johanan, and Johanan fathered Jaddua.

Neh 12:12 In the days of Joiakim the heads of the priestly families were: family of Seraiah, Meraiah; of
Jeremiah, Hananiah;

Neh 12:13 of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;

Neh 12:14 of Malluch, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;

Neh 12:15 of Harim, Adna; of Meremoth, Helkai;

Neh 12:16 of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;

Neh 12:17 of Abijah, Zichri; of Minjamin, . . of Moadiah, Piltai;

Neh 12:18 ofBilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan;

Neh 12:19 and of Jojarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;

Neh 12:20 of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;

Neh 12:21 of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel.

Neh 12:22 In the time of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan and Jaddua, the heads of the families of priests were
registered in the Book of Chronicles, up to the reign of Darius the Persian.

Neh 12:23 The Levites who were heads of families were registered in the Book of Chronicles up to the time of
Johanan, grandson of Eliashib.

Neh 12:24 The heads of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, while their brothers
who formed an alternate choir for the hymns of praise and thanksgiving, as David, man of God, had prescribed,
section corresponding to section,

Neh 12:25 were Mattaniah, Bakbukiah and Obadiah. Meshullam, Talmon and Akkub were the gatekeepers
guarding the stores at the gates.

Neh 1 2:26 These lived in the days of Joiakim son of Jeshua, son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the
governor and of Ezra the priest-scribe.

Neh 1 2:27 At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem the Levites were sent for, wherever they lived, to come to
Jerusalem and joyfully perform the dedication with hymns of thanksgiving and songs to the accompaniment of
cymbals, lyres and harps.

Neh 12:28 Accordingly, the levitical singers assembled from the district round Jerusalem, from the villages of
the Netophathites,

Neh 1 2:29 from Beth-Gilgal and from their farms at Geba and Azmaveth — for the singers had built themselves
villages all round Jerusalem.

Neh 12:30 When the priests and Levites had purified themselves, they then purified the people, the gates and
the wall.

Neh 1 2:31 I then made the leaders of Judah come on to the top of the wall and appointed two large choirs. One
made its way along the top of the wall, to the right, towards the Dung Gate;

Neh 1 2:32 bringing up the rear were Hoshaiah and half the leaders of Judah,

Neh 12:33 and also Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,

Neh 12:34 Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah and Jeremiah,

Neh 12:35 of the priests, with trumpets; then Zechariah son of Jonathan, son of Shemaiah, son of Mattaniah,
son of Micaiah, son of Zaccur, son of Asaph,

Neh 12:36 with his kinsmen, Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Juda, Hanani, with the musical
instruments of David, man of God. The scribe Ezra walked at their head.

Neh 12:37 At the Fountain Gate they went straight on up the steps of the City of David, along the top of the
rampart by the stairway of the wall, above the Palace of David as far as the Water Gate, on the east.

Neh 12:38 The other choir made its way to the left; I and half the leaders of the people followed them along the
top of the wall from the Tower of the Furnaces to the Broad Wall,

Neh 12:39 from the Ephraim Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred as far as
the Sheep Gate, and they came to a halt at the Prison Gate.

Neh 12:40 The two choirs then took their places in the Temple of God. But I had half the magistrates with me
Neh 12:41 as well as the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, Hananiah with the
trumpets,

Neh 12:42 and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam and Ezer. The singers sang
loudly under the direction of Jezrahiah.

Neh 12:43 There were great sacrifices offered that day and the people rejoiced, God having given them good
cause for rejoicing; the women and children rejoiced too, and the joy of Jerusalem could be heard from far away.
Neh 12:44 For the rooms intended for the treasures, contributions, first-fruits and tithes, supervisors were then
appointed whose business it was to collect in them those portions from the town lands awarded by the Law to
the priests and Levites. For Judah rejoiced in the officiating priests and Levites,



Neh 12:45 since they — with the singers and gatekeepers — performed the liturgy of their God and the rites of
purification as ordained by David and his son Solomon.

Neh 1 2:46 For from ancient times, from the days of David and Asaph, they had been the leaders in rendering
hymns of praise and thanksgiving to God.

Neh 1 2:47 In the days of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah, all Israel supplied regular daily portions for the singers and
gatekeepers, and gave the dedicated contributions to the Levites; and the Levites gave the dedicated
contributions to the Aaronites.

Neh 13:1 At that time they were reading to the people from the Book of Moses, when they found this written in it,
“No Ammonite or Moabite is to be admitted to the assembly of God, and this is for all time,

Neh 13:2 since they did not come to meet the Israelites with bread and water, and even hired Balaam to oppose
them by cursing them; but our God turned the curse into a blessing”.

Neh 13:3 Having heard the Law, they excluded all foreigners from Israel.

Neh 13:4 Earlier, Eliashib the priest, who was in charge of the rooms of the Temple of our God, and who was
close to Tobiah,

Neh 13:5 had provided him with a large room where they previously used to store the meal offerings, incense,
utensils, tithes of corn, wine and oil, that is, the part of the Levites, singers and gatekeepers, and the
contributions for the priests.

Neh 13:6 While all this was going on I was away from Jerusalem, for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king
of Babylon I had gone to see the king. But after some time I asked the king for permission to leave,

Neh 13:7 and returned to Jerusalem, where I learned about the crime which Eliashib had committed for Tobiah’s
benefit, by providing him with a room in the courts of the Temple of God.

Neh 13:8 I was extremely displeased and threw all Tobiah’s household goods out of the room and into the
street.

Neh 13:9 I then gave orders for the room to be purified, and had the utensils of the Temple of God, the meal
offerings and the incense, all replaced.

Neh 13:10 I also learned that the Levites had not been receiving their allocations, as a result of which the
Levites and singers who performed the liturgy had all withdrawn to their farms.

Neh 13:1 1 I then reprimanded the officials. “Why is the Temple of God deserted?”. I asked. And I collected them
together again and brought them back to their posts;

Neh 13:12 and all Judah then delivered the tithe of corn, wine and oil to the storehouses.

Neh 13:13 As supervisors of the storehouses I appointed Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, Pedaiah one
of the Levites and, as their assistant, Hanan son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah, since they were considered
reliable people; their duty was to make the distributions to their kinsmen.

Neh 13:14 Remember me for this, my God, and do not blot out the good deeds which I have done for the
Temple of my God and its observances!

Neh 13:15 At the same time I saw people in Judah treading the winepress, bringing in sacks of grain and
loading donkeys on the Sabbath; they were also bringing wine, grapes, figs and every kind of merchandise into
Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. So I forbade them to sell the food.

Neh 13:16 Tyrians living there were bringing in fish and every kind of merchandise which they were selling to
the Judaeans on the Sabbath in Jerusalem itself.

Neh 13:17 So I also reprimanded the leading men of Judah, saying to them, “What a wicked way to behave,
profaning the Sabbath day!

Neh 13:18 Was this not exactly what your ancestors did, with the result that our God brought all this misery
down on us and on this city? And now you are adding to the wrath hanging over Israel by profaning the Sabbath
yourselves!”.

Neh 13:19 So when the gates of Jerusalem were getting dark at the approach of the Sabbath, I gave orders for
the doors to be shut and directed that they were not to be opened again until the Sabbath was over. I stationed
some of my attendants at the gates to make sure that no merchandise was brought in on the Sabbath day.

Neh 13:20 So the traders and dealers in goods of all kinds spent the night outside Jerusalem once or twice,

Neh 13:21 until I reprimanded them. I said to them, “Why are you spending the night in front of the wall? Do it
again, and I shall use force on you”. After this, they did not come on the Sabbath.

Neh 13:22 I then ordered the Levites to purify themselves and act as guards at the gates, so that the Sabbath
day might be kept holy. Remember this also to my credit, have pity on me in the greatness of your faithful love.
Neh 13:23 At that time too, I saw Jews who had married wives from Ashdod, Ammon and Moab;

Neh 1 3:24 as regards their children, half of them spoke the language of Ashdod or the language of one of the
other peoples, but could no longer speak the language of Judah.

Neh 13:25 I reprimanded them, I cursed them, I struck several of them and tore out their hair and adjured them
by God, “You are not to give your daughters in marriage to their sons or let their daughters marry your sons, or
marry them yourselves!



Neh 13:26 Was it not because of women like these that Solomon king of Israel sinned? Although among many
nations there was no king like him and he was loved by his God, and God made him king of all Israel, even then
foreign women led him into sinning!

Neh 13:27 Were you obedient when you committed this very grave crime: breaking faith with our God by
marrying foreign wives?”.

Neh 1 3:28 One of the sons of Jehoiada, son of Eliashib the high priest, was a son-in-law of Sanballat the
Horonite; I drove him from my presence.

Neh 1 3:29 Remember them, my God, for having defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priests and
Levites!

Neh 13:30 And so I purged them of everything foreign; I drew up regulations for the priests and Levites, defining
each man’s duty,

Neh 1 3:31 as well as for the deliveries of wood at the proper times, and for the first-fruits. Remember this, my
God, to my credit!
