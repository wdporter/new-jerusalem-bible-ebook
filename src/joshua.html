<h2 id="i">I: The Conquest of the Promised Land (1:1–12:24)</h2>

<h3 id="ia">A: The Preparation (1:1–2:24)</h3>

<h4>The summons to enter the Promised Land (1:1–5)</h4>

<p>When Moses, servant of Yahweh, was dead, Yahweh spoke to Joshua son of Nun, Moses’ adjutant. He said, “Moses my servant is dead; go now and cross this Jordan, you and this whole people, into the country which I am giving to them (the Israelites). Every place you tread with the soles of your feet I shall give you, as I declared to Moses that I would. From the desert and the Lebanon, to the Great River, the Euphrates (the entire country of the Hittites), and as far as the Great Sea to westward, is to be your territory. As long as you live, no one will be able to resist you; I shall be with you as I was with Moses; I shall not fail you or desert you. </p>

<h4>God’s help conditional on faithfulness to the Law (1:6–9)</h4>

<p>“Be strong and stand firm, for you are the man to give this people possession of the land which I swore to their ancestors that I would give them. Only be strong and stand very firm and be careful to keep the whole Law which my servant Moses laid down for you. Do not swerve from this either to right or to left, and then you will succeed wherever you go. Have the book of this Law always on your lips; meditate on it day and night, so that you may carefully keep everything that is written in it. Then your undertakings will prosper, then you will have success. Have I not told you: Be strong and stand firm? Be fearless and undaunted, for go where you may, Yahweh your God is with you”. </p>

<h4>Support from the Transjordanian tribes (1:10–18)</h4>

<p>Joshua then gave the people’s officials this instruction: “Go through the camp and give the people this order, ‘Make provisions ready, for in three days’ time you will cross this Jordan and go on to take possession of the land which Yahweh your God is giving you as your own’”. Joshua then said to the Reubenites and Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, “Remember the order given you by Moses, servant of Yahweh: Yahweh your God, in bringing you to rest, has given you the land where we are. Your wives, your little ones and your cattle must stay in the country given you by Moses beyond the Jordan. But all you fighting men must cross in battle formation at the head of your brothers and help them, until Yahweh grants rest to your brothers and you alike, when they too have taken possession of the land which Yahweh your God is giving to them. Then you may go back and take possession of the land which belongs to you and which Moses, servant of Yahweh, has given you on the eastern side of the Jordan”. </p>

<p>They answered Joshua, “We will do whatever you order us, and wherever you send us we will go. We obeyed Moses in everything, and now we will obey you. Only may Yahweh your God be with you as he was with Moses! If anyone rebels against your orders or will not listen to your commands, let him be put to death. Only be strong and stand firm”. </p>

<h4>Joshua’s spies at Jericho (2:1–7)</h4>

<p>From Shittim, Joshua son of Nun secretly sent two men to reconnoitre. He said, “Go and explore the country and Jericho”. They left; they went into the house of a prostitute called Rahab, to spend the night there. </p>

<p>The king of Jericho was told, “Some men have come here tonight from the Israelites, to reconnoitre the country”. </p>

<p>The king of Jericho then sent a message to Rahab, “Send out the men who came to you and are lodging in your house, for they have come to reconnoitre the whole country”. </p>

<p>But the woman took the two men and hid them. “It is true”, she said, “the men did come to me, but I did not know where they came from. When the city gate was about to be closed at nightfall, the men went out and I cannot say where they have gone. Follow them quickly and you will overtake them”. </p>

<p>She had taken them up to the roof and hidden them under some stalks of flax which she had laid out there. The men hurried in pursuit of them towards the Jordan, as far as the fords, and the gate was shut once the pursuers had gone through. </p>

<h4>The pact between Rahab and the spies (2:8–21)</h4>

<p>The two men had not yet settled down for the night when Rahab came up to them on the roof. She said to them, “I know that Yahweh has given you this country, that we are afraid of you and that everyone living in this country has been seized with terror at your approach; for we have heard how Yahweh dried up the Sea of Reeds before you when you came out of Egypt and what you did to the two Amorite kings across the Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you put under the curse of destruction. When we heard this, our hearts failed us, and now no one has any courage left to resist you, since Yahweh your God is God both in heaven above and on earth beneath. So, swear to me now by Yahweh, since I have been kind to you, that you in your turn will be kind to my father’s family; and give me a sure sign of this: that you will spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters and all who belong to them, and will preserve us from death”. </p>

<p>The men replied, “We pledge you our lives, provided that you say nothing about our mission. When Yahweh has given us the country, we shall treat you kindly and faithfully”. She then let them down from the window on a rope, as her house was against the city wall and she actually lived in the wall. </p>

<p>“Make for the hills”, she said, “or you may run into your pursuers. Hide there for three days, until your pursuers have come back, and then go on your way”. </p>

<p>The men said, “This is how we shall fulfil the oath which you have made us swear: when we invade the country, you must tie this scarlet cord to the window from which you let us down, and collect your father, mother, brothers and entire family inside your house. If anyone goes out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood will be on his own head and we shall not be to blame; but the blood of all staying inside the house with you will be on our heads if a hand is laid on any of them. But if you divulge our mission in the meanwhile, we shall be free of the oath which you have made us swear”. </p>

<p>She replied, “Let it be as you say”. She let them go, and they left. She then tied the scarlet cord to the window. </p>

<h4>The spies return (2:22–24)</h4>

<p>They left and made for the hills. They stayed there for three days, until their pursuers had gone home, having scoured the countryside without finding them. The two men then came down again from the hills, crossed over and, going to Joshua son of Nun, told him everything that had happened to them. To Joshua they said, “Yahweh has put the whole country at our mercy, and its inhabitants are all panic-stricken at our approach”. </p>

<h3 id="ib">B: The Crossing of the Jordan (3:1–5:12)</h3>

<h4>Before the crossing (3:1–6)</h4>

<p>Early in the morning, Joshua struck camp and set out from Shittim with all the Israelites. They went as far as the Jordan and there they camped before they crossed. Three days later, the officials went through the camp and gave the people these instructions, “When you see the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your God being carried by the levitical priests, you will leave your position and follow it, so that you may know which way to take, since you have never gone this way before. Between you and the ark, however, keep a distance of about two thousand cubits: do not go near it”. </p>

<p>Joshua said to the people, “Sanctify yourselves, since tomorrow Yahweh will work wonders among you”. Joshua then said to the priests, “Take up the ark of the covenant and cross at the head of the people”. </p>

<h4>Final instruction (3:7–13)</h4>

<p>They took up the ark of the covenant and moved to the head of the people. Yahweh said to Joshua, “This very day, I shall begin to make you great in the eyes of all Israel so that they will know that, as I was with Moses, so I shall be with you. Now, give this order to the priests carrying the ark of the covenant, ‘When you have reached the brink of the waters of the Jordan, you must halt in the Jordan itself’”. </p>

<p>To the Israelites, Joshua then said, “Come closer and hear the words of Yahweh your God”. Joshua said, “By this, you are to know that the living God is with you and without a doubt will expel the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites and Jebusites before you. Look, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of the whole earth is about to move into the Jordan at your head. Now choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man from each tribe. As soon as the priests carrying the ark of Yahweh, Lord of the whole earth, have set the soles of their feet in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan will be cut off; the upper waters flowing down will stop as a single mass”. </p>

<h4>Crossing the Jordan (3:14–17)</h4>

<p>Accordingly, when the people left their tents to cross the Jordan, the priests carried the ark of the covenant ahead of the people. As soon as the bearers of the ark reached the Jordan and the feet of the priests carrying the ark touched the waters — the Jordan is in spate throughout the harvest season — the upper waters stood still and formed a single mass over a great distance, at Adam, the town near Zarethan, while those flowing down to the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were completely separated. The people crossed opposite Jericho. The priests carrying the ark of the covenant of Yahweh stood firm on dry ground in mid-Jordan, while all Israel crossed on dry ground, until the whole nation had completed its crossing of the Jordan. </p>

<h4>The twelve memorial stones (4:1–9)</h4>

<p>When the whole nation had finished crossing the Jordan, Yahweh spoke to Joshua and said, “Choose twelve men from the people, one man from each tribe, and give them this order, ‘Here, from mid-Jordan, from the place where the priests’ feet were standing, take twelve stones; carry them with you and set them down in the camp where you pass the night’”. </p>

<p>Joshua called the twelve men whom he had selected from the Israelites, one man from each tribe, and Joshua said to them, “Go on ahead of the ark of Yahweh your God into mid-Jordan, and each of you take one stone on his shoulder, corresponding to the number of the tribes of Israel, to make this a sign among you; and when, in the future, your children ask you, ‘What do these stones mean for you?’, you will then tell them, ‘The waters of the Jordan separated before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh; when it crossed the Jordan, the waters of the river separated. These stones are an everlasting reminder of this to the Israelites’. The Israelites did as Joshua ordered; they took twelve stones from mid-Jordan corresponding to the number of the tribes of Israel, as Yahweh had told Joshua; they carried them over to the camp and set them down there. Joshua then erected twelve stones in mid-Jordan, on the spot where the feet of the priests carrying the ark of the covenant had stood; and they are still there today. </p>

<h4>The crossing ends (4:10–18)</h4>

<p>The priests carrying the ark stood still in mid-Jordan, until everything had been done that Yahweh had ordered Joshua to tell the people (in accordance with everything that Moses had ordered Joshua); and the people hurried across. When the people had finished crossing, the ark of Yahweh then crossed, with the priests, to the head of the people. The sons of Reuben, the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed in battle formation at the head of the Israelites, as Moses had told them. Some forty thousand warriors in arms, they crossed in Yahweh’s presence, ready for battle, towards the plain of Jericho. That day, Yahweh made Joshua great in the eyes of all Israel, who respected him as they had respected Moses, as long as he lived. Yahweh said to Joshua, “Order the priests carrying the ark of the Testimony to come up out of the Jordan”. </p>

<p>And Joshua gave the order to the priests, “Come up, out of the Jordan!”. Now, when the priests carrying the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came up out of mid-Jordan, no sooner had the soles of the priests’ feet touched solid ground, than the waters of the Jordan returned to their bed and ran on, in spate as before. </p>

<h4>Arrival at Gilgal (4:19–24)</h4>

<p>It was the tenth day of the first month when the people came up from the Jordan and made their camp at Gilgal, on the eastern border of Jericho. As regards those twelve stones, which they had taken from the Jordan, Joshua set them up at Gilgal. He then said to the Israelites, “When, in the future, your children ask their fathers, ‘What are these stones?’. you will explain to your children, ‘Israel crossed this Jordan dry-shod. For Yahweh your God dried up the waters of the Jordan in front of you until you had crossed, just as Yahweh your God did to the Sea of Reeds, which he dried up before us until we had crossed it; so that all the peoples of the earth may know how mighty the hand of Yahweh is, and always stand in awe of Yahweh your God’”. </p>

<h4>Terror of the peoples west of the Jordan (5:1)</h4>

<p>When all the kings of the Amorites living to westward across the Jordan, and all the kings of the Canaanites living on the seaboard, heard that Yahweh had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the Israelites until they had crossed, their hearts failed and they lost all courage to resist the Israelites. </p>

<h4>Circumcision of the Hebrews at Gilgal (5:2–9)</h4>

<p>At this time Yahweh said to Joshua, “Make flint knives and circumcise the Israelites again (a second time). Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the Israelites on the Hill of Foreskins. </p>

<p>The reason why Joshua circumcised them was this. All the males of the people who had come out of Egypt of age to bear arms had died in the desert on their journey after leaving Egypt. Now, all the people who came out had been circumcised; but none of those born in the desert, during the journey, after leaving Egypt, had been circumcised; for the Israelites walked the desert for forty years, until the whole nation had died out, that is, the men who had come out of Egypt of age to bear arms; they had not obeyed the voice of Yahweh, and Yahweh had sworn to them never to let them see the land which he had sworn to their ancestors that he would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey. But in place of these he set their sons, and these were the ones whom Joshua circumcised: they were uncircumcised because they had not been circumcised during the journey. When the circumcising of the whole nation was finished, they stayed resting in the camp until they were well again. Yahweh then said to Joshua, “Today I have taken the shame of Egypt away from you”. Hence, the place has been called Gilgal ever since. </p>

<h4>Celebration of the Passover (5:10–12)</h4>

<p>The Israelites pitched their camp at Gilgal and kept the Passover there on the fourteenth day of the month, at evening, in the plain of Jericho. On the very next day after the Passover, they ate what the land produced, unleavened bread and roasted ears of corn. The manna stopped the day after they had eaten the produce of the land. The Israelites from that year onwards ate the produce of Canaan and had no more manna. </p>

<h3 id="ic">C: The Conquest of Jericho (5:13–7:26)</h3>

<h4>Prelude: a theophany (5:13–15)</h4>

<p>Now when Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him, grasping a naked sword. Joshua walked towards him and said to him, “Are you on our side or on that of our enemies?”. </p>

<p>He replied, “On neither side. I have come now as the captain of the army of Yahweh”. </p>

<p>Joshua fell on his face to the ground, worshipping him, and said, “What has my Lord to say to his servant?”. </p>

<p>The captain of the army of Yahweh answered Joshua, “Take your sandals off your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy”. And Joshua did so. </p>

<h4>Capture of Jericho (6:1–16)</h4>

<p>Now, Jericho had shut and barricaded its gates (against the Israelites): no one came out and no one went in. Yahweh then said to Joshua, “Look, I am putting Jericho, its picked troops and its king, at your mercy. All you warriors must march round the city (go right round the city once, doing the same on six successive days. Seven priests must carry seven ram’s-horn trumpets in front of the ark. On the seventh day, you will go seven times round the city and the priests will blow their trumpets). When the ram’s horn sounds (when you hear the sound of the trumpet), the entire people must utter a mighty war cry and the city wall will collapse then and there; the people will then go into the assault, each man straight ahead”. </p>

<p>Joshua son of Nun summoned the priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests carry seven ram’s-horn trumpets ahead of the ark of Yahweh”. To the people he then said, “Forward! March round the city, and let the vanguard march ahead of the ark of Yahweh!”. (Everything was done as Joshua had given orders to the people.) Seven priests, carrying seven ram’s-horn trumpets ahead of Yahweh, moved forward blowing their trumpets; the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came behind them, the vanguard marched ahead of the priests, who blew their trumpets, the rear-guard followed behind the ark; the men marched, the trumpets sounded. </p>

<p>Joshua had given the people the following orders, “Do not raise a war cry, do not let your voice be heard (not a word must pass your lips), until the day when I say, ‘Raise the war cry’. That is when you must raise the war cry”. </p>

<p>He made the ark go round the city (going round it once), then they went back to camp, where they spent the night. Joshua got up early, and the priests took up the ark of Yahweh. Carrying the seven ram’s-horn trumpets, the seven priests walked ahead of the ark of Yahweh, blowing their trumpets as they went, while the vanguard marched ahead of them and the rear-guard behind the ark of Yahweh, and the march went on to the sound of the trumpet. </p>

<p>They marched once round the city (on the second day) and went back to camp; and so on for six days. On the seventh day, they got up at dawn and marched (in the same manner) round the city seven times. (This was the only day when they marched round the city seven times.) At the seventh time, the priests blew their trumpets and Joshua said to the people, “Raise the war cry,
for Yahweh has given you the city! </p>

<h4>Jericho placed under the curse of destruction (6:17–21)</h4>

<p>“The city and everyone in it must be devoted to Yahweh under the curse of destruction; the life of Rahab the prostitute alone must be spared, with all those with her in her house, since she hid the messengers we sent. But beware of the curse of destruction, yourselves, for fear that, moved by greed, you take something lying under the curse; that would put the camp of Israel under the same curse and bring disaster on it. All the silver and all the gold, everything made of bronze or iron, will be consecrated to Yahweh and put in his treasury”. </p>

<p>The people raised the war cry, the trumpets sounded. When the people heard the sound of the trumpet, they raised a mighty war cry and the wall collapsed then and there. At once the people stormed the city, each man going straight forward; and they captured the city. They enforced the curse of destruction on everyone in the city: men and women, young and old, including the oxen, the sheep and the donkeys, slaughtering them all. </p>

<h4>Rahab’s house preserved (6:22–25)</h4>

<p>Joshua said to the two men who had reconnoitred the country, “Go into the prostitute’s house, and bring the woman out with all who belong to her, as you swore to her that you would”. The young men who had been spies went and brought Rahab out, with her father and mother and brothers and all who belonged to her. They brought out all her clansmen too, and put them in a place of safety outside the camp of Israel. </p>

<p>They burned the city and everything inside it, except the silver, the gold and the things of bronze and iron; these they put into the treasury of Yahweh’s house. But Rahab the prostitute, her father’s family and all who belonged to her, these Joshua spared. She is still living in Israel even today, for having hidden the messengers whom Joshua sent to reconnoitre Jericho. </p>

<h4>A curse on anyone who rebuilds Jericho (6:26–27)</h4>

<p>At that time Joshua made them take this oath before Yahweh: </p>

<blockquote>Accursed before Yahweh be the man who rises up <br />
and rebuilds this city (Jericho)! <br />
On his first-born will he lay its foundations, <br />
on his youngest son set up its gates! </blockquote>

<p>So Yahweh was with Joshua, whose fame spread throughout the country. </p>

<h4>Violation of the curse of destruction (7:1)</h4>

<p>But the Israelites were unfaithful to the curse of destruction. Achan son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took something that fell under the curse of destruction, and the anger of Yahweh was aroused against the Israelites. </p>

<h4>The sacrilege punished by a repulse at Ai (7:2–5)</h4>

<p>Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai (which is near Beth-Aven), to the east of Bethel, having said to them, “Go up and reconnoitre the country”. They went up and reconnoitred Ai. </p>

<p>Coming back to Joshua, they said, “There is no need for the whole people to go up; let some two or three thousand go and attack Ai. Spare the whole people such an effort; there are only a few of them!”. </p>

<p>Of the people, some three thousand marched up, but these broke before the people of Ai, who killed some thirty-six of them and pursued them from the town gate as far as Shebarim, and on the slope cut them to pieces. The hearts of the people melted away and turned to water. </p>

<h4>Joshua’s prayer (7:6–9)</h4>

<p>Joshua then tore his clothes and prostrated himself before the ark of Yahweh until nightfall; the elders of Israel did the same, and all poured dust on their heads. And Joshua said, “Alas, Lord Yahweh, why did you bother to bring this nation across the Jordan, if it was only to put us at the mercy of the Amorites and destroy us? If only we could have settled down on the other side of the Jordan! Forgive me, Lord, but what can I say, now that Israel has turned tail on the enemy? The Canaanites, all the inhabitants of the land, will hear of it; they will unite against us to wipe our name from the earth. And what will you do about your great Name then?”. </p>

<h4>Yahweh’s answer (7:10–15)</h4>

<p>Yahweh said to Joshua, “Stand up! Why are you lying prostrate like this? Israel has sinned; they have violated the covenant which I imposed on them. They have gone so far as to take what was under the curse of destruction, they have even stolen it; they have actually hidden it; they have put it in their baggage. That is why the Israelites cannot stand up to their foes, why they have turned tail on their enemies: because they have come under the curse of destruction themselves. Unless you get rid of the object among you which has been put under the curse of destruction, I shall be with you no longer. </p>

<p>“Get up, sanctify the people and say, ‘Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, since Yahweh, the God of Israel, declares: The curse of destruction has now fallen on you, Israel; you will not be able to stand up to your enemies, until you have rid yourselves of that object which has been put under the curse of destruction. Tomorrow morning, therefore, you will come forward tribe by tribe, and then the tribe which Yahweh selects by lot will come forward clan by clan, and the clan which Yahweh selects by lot will come forward family by family, and the family which Yahweh selects by lot will come forward man by man. And the man indicated by lot as regards the object which has been put under the curse of destruction will be delivered to the flames, he and all his possessions, for having violated the covenant with Yahweh and for having committed an infamy in Israel’”. </p>

<h4>The culprit discovered and punished (7:16–26)</h4>

<p>Joshua got up early; he made Israel come forward tribe by tribe, and the lot indicated the tribe of Judah. He summoned the clans of Judah, and the lot indicated the clan of Zerah. He summoned the clan of Zerah, family by family, and the lot indicated Zabdi. Joshua then summoned the family of Zabdi, man by man, and the lot indicated Achan son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah. </p>

<p>Joshua then said to Achan, “My son, give glory to Yahweh, God of Israel, and confess; tell me what you have done and hide nothing from me”. </p>

<p>Achan replied to Joshua, “Yes, I am the man who has sinned against Yahweh, God of Israel, and this is what I have done. In the loot, I saw a fine robe from Shinar and two hundred shekels of silver and an ingot of gold weighing fifty shekels, I set my heart on them and I took them. They are hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the silver underneath”. </p>

<p>Joshua sent messengers; they ran to the tent, and the robe was indeed hidden in the tent, with the silver underneath. They took the things out of the tent and, bringing them to Joshua and all the Israelites, laid them out before Yahweh. </p>

<p>Joshua then took Achan son of Zerah and led him up to the Vale of Achor, with the silver and the robe and the ingot of gold, his sons, his daughters, his oxen, his donkeys, his sheep, his goats, his tent and all his belongings. All Israel went with him. </p>

<p>Joshua said, “Why have you brought misfortune on us? Today may Yahweh bring misfortune on you!”. And all Israel stoned him to death (and they burned them and threw stones at them). </p>

<p>Over him, they raised a great mound of stones, which is still there today. Yahweh then relented from his fierce anger. That was why the place was called the Vale of Achor, as it still is today. </p>

<h3 id="id">D: The Capture of Ai (8:1–35)</h3>

<h4>The command given to Joshua (8:1–2)</h4>

<p>Yahweh then said to Joshua, “Be fearless and undaunted. Take all your fighting men with you. Up! March against Ai. Look, I have put the king of Ai, his people, his town and his territory at your mercy. You must treat Ai and its king as you treated Jericho and its king. The only booty you will take are the spoils and the cattle. Take up a concealed position by the town, to the rear of it”. </p>

<h4>Joshua’s strategem (8:3–13)</h4>

<p>Joshua set out to march against Ai with all the fighting men. Joshua chose thirty thousand of the bravest and sent them out under cover of dark, having given them these orders, “Pay attention! You must take up a concealed position by the town, at the rear, not very far from the town, and be sure you all keep alert! I, and the whole people with me, shall advance on the town, and when the people of Ai come out to engage us as they did the first time, we shall run away from them. They will then give chase, and we shall draw them away from the town, since they will think, ‘They are running away from us as they did the first time’. You will then burst out of your concealed position and seize the town; Yahweh your God will put it at your mercy. When you have captured the town, set fire to it, in obedience to Yahweh’s command. Well then, these are my orders”. Joshua sent them off, and they made their way to the place of ambush and took up position between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai. Joshua spent the night with the people, then, getting up early next morning, reviewed the people and, with the elders of Israel, marched on Ai at their head. All the warriors marching with him advanced on the front of the town and pitched camp north of Ai, with the valley between them and the town. Joshua took about five thousand men and concealed these between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the town. The people pitched the main camp to the north of the town and set up its ambush to the west of the town. Joshua went that night into the middle of the plain. </p>

<h4>The capture of Ai (8:15–25)</h4>

<p>The king of Ai had seen this; the people of the town got up early and hurried out, so that he and all his people could engage Israel in battle on the slope facing the Arabah; but he did not know that an ambush had been laid for him to the rear of the town. Joshua and all Israel pretended to be beaten by them and took to their heels along the road to the desert. All the people in the town joined in the pursuit and, in pursuing Joshua, were drawn away from the town. Not a man was left in Ai (nor in Bethel), who had not gone in pursuit of Israel; and in pursuing Israel they left the town undefended. </p>

<p>Yahweh then said to Joshua, “Point the sabre in your hand at Ai; for I am about to put the town at your mercy”. Joshua pointed the sabre in his hand towards the town. No sooner had he stretched out his hand than the men in ambush burst from their position, ran forward, entered the town, captured it and quickly set it on fire. </p>

<p>When the men of Ai looked back, they saw smoke rising from the town into the sky. None of them had the courage to run in any direction, for the people fleeing towards the desert turned back on their pursuers. For, once Joshua and all Israel saw that the town had been seized by the men in ambush, and that smoke was rising from the town, they turned about and attacked the men of Ai. The others came out from the town to engage them too, and the men of Ai were thus surrounded by Israelites, some on this side and some on that. The Israelites struck them down until not one was left alive and none to flee; but the king of Ai was taken alive, and brought to Joshua. When Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the open ground, and in the desert where they had pursued them, and when every single one had fallen to the sword, all Israel returned to Ai and slaughtered its remaining population. The number of those who fell that day, men and women together, was twelve thousand, all people of Ai. </p>

<h4>The curse of destruction; the destruction of the town (8:26–29)</h4>

<p>Joshua did not draw back the hand with which he had pointed the sabre until he had subjected all the inhabitants of Ai to the curse of destruction. For booty, Israel took only the cattle and the spoils of this town, in accordance with the order that Yahweh had given to Joshua. Joshua then burned Ai, making it a ruin for evermore, a desolate place even today. He hanged the king of Ai from a tree until evening; but at sunset Joshua ordered his body to be taken down from the tree. It was then thrown down at the entrance to the town gate and on top of it was raised a great mound of stones, which is still there today. </p>

<h3 id="ie">E: Sacrifice and Reading of the Law on Mount Ebal (8:30–35)</h3>

<h4>The altar of undressed stones (8:30–31)</h4>

<p>Joshua then built an altar to Yahweh, God of Israel, on Mount Ebal, as Moses, servant of Yahweh, had ordered the Israelites, as is written in the law of Moses: an altar of undressed stones, on which no iron has been used. On this they presented burnt offerings to Yahweh and communion sacrifices as well. </p>

<h4>The reading of the Law (8:32–35)</h4>

<p>There, Joshua wrote on the stones a copy of the Law of Moses, which Moses had written in the presence of the Israelites. All Israel, with their elders, their officials and their judges, stood on either side of the ark, facing the levitical priests who were carrying the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, foreigners with the native-born, half of them on the upper slopes of Mount Gerizim, and half of them on the upper slopes of Mount Ebal, as Moses, servant of Yahweh, had originally ordered for the blessing of the people of Israel. After this, Joshua read all the words of the Law — the blessing and the cursing — exactly as it stands written in the Book of the Law. Of every word laid down by Moses, not one was left unread by Joshua in the presence of the whole assembly of Israel, including the women and children, and the foreigners living with them. </p>

<h3 id="if">F: The Treaty Between Israel and the Gibeonites (9:1–27)</h3>

<h4>A coälition against Israel (9:1–2)</h4>

<p>Hearing these things, all the kings on this side of the Jordan, in the highlands and in the lowlands, all along the coast of the Great Sea towards the Lebanon, Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites, with one consent formed a fighting alliance against Joshua and Israel. </p>

<h4>The rise of the Gibeonites (9:3–18)</h4>

<p>When the inhabitants of Gibeon learned how Joshua had treated Jericho and Ai, for their part, they had recourse to a ruse. They provided themselves with supplies, and loaded their donkeys with old sacks and with old wineskins which had burst and been sewn up again. They put on patched old sandals and worn-out clothes. The only bread they took with them to eat was dried up and crumbling. </p>

<p>They came to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal, and to him and the men of Israel they said, “We come from a distant country, so make a treaty with us”. </p>

<p>The Israelites answered these Hivites, “For all we know, you may live right among us. How then could we make a treaty with you?”. </p>

<p>They said to Joshua, “We are your servants”. </p>

<p>“But who are you?”, Joshua asked them, “and where do you come from?”. </p>

<p>They said, “Your servants have come from a country very far away, because of the fame of Yahweh your God; for we have heard of him and of all that he did in Egypt, and of all that he did to the two Amorite kings who used to live on the other side of the Jordan: Sihon king of Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who used to live at Ashtaroth. Because of which, our elders and all the people of our country said to us, ‘Take provisions with you for the journey; go and meet them and say to them: We are your servants; so make a treaty with us’. Here is our bread; it was warm when we took it from home to provide for our journey the day we set out to come to you, and now, you can see, it is dried up and crumbling. These wineskins were new when we filled them; you can see, they have burst; and these clothes and sandals of ours are worn out from travelling such a long way”. </p>

<p>The leaders sampled some of the food they offered, but they did not ask Yahweh’s orders. Joshua made peace with them, and struck a treaty with them guaranteeing their lives, and the leaders of the community ratified it by oath. </p>

<p>Now it so happened that three days after the treaty had been made, it became known that they were a neighbouring people, living in Israel’s region. The Israelites set out from camp, arriving in their towns three days later. Their towns were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth and Kiriath-Jearim. The Israelites did not attack them, since the leaders of the community had sworn to them by Yahweh, God of Israel, but the whole community muttered against the leaders. </p>

<h4>The Gibeonites’ place in the community (9:19–27)</h4>

<p>The leaders, however, all said to the whole community, “Since we have sworn an oath to them by Yahweh, God of Israel, we cannot touch them now. This is what we shall do with them: let them live, rather than bring retribution down on ourselves on account of the oath which we have sworn to them”. And the leaders went on, “Let them live, but let them be wood-cutters and water-carriers for the whole community”. Thus spoke the leaders. </p>

<p>Joshua sent for the Gibeonites and asked them, “Why did you deceive us by saying, ‘We live very far away’, when in fact you live right among us? From now on, you are accursed and will for ever be serfs, as wood-cutters and water-carriers in the house of my God”. </p>

<p>Their answer to Joshua was, “We did it because your servants had been rightly told that Yahweh your God had ordered his servant Moses to give you the whole of this country and destroy all its inhabitants before you; also because, as you advanced on us, we feared very greatly for our lives. That was why we did this. Now, as you see, we are at your mercy; do to us whatever you think good and right”. What he did with them was this: he saved them from the hand of the Israelites, who did not kill them. But that very day Joshua made them wood-cutters and water-carriers for the community and for the altar of Yahweh, at the place which he would eventually choose; and so they are today. </p>

<h3 id="ig">G: Coälition of Five Amorite Kings<br />Conquest of Southern Palestine (10:1–43)</h3>

<h4>Five kings make war on Gibeon (10:1–5)</h4>

<p>Now, it happened that Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem, learned that Joshua had conquered Ai and put the town under the curse of destruction, treating Ai and its king as he had already treated Jericho and its king; and also that the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were living with them. There was consternation at this, since Gibeon was as important a town as any of the royal towns themselves (it was larger than Ai), while all its citizens were fighting men. Consequently, Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent word to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish, and Debir king of Eglon, “Join me up here and help me to conquer Gibeon, since it has made peace with Joshua and the Israelites”. The five Amorite kings joined forces and went up there, that is, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish and the king of Eglon, they and all their armies; laying siege to Gibeon, they attacked it. </p>

<h4>Joshua comes to the rescue of Gibeon (10:6–9)</h4>

<p>The men of Gibeon sent word to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal, “Do not desert your servants; come up here quickly to save us and help us, since all the Amorite kings living in the highlands have allied themselves against us”. Joshua came up from Gilgal, he, all the fighting men and all the bravest of his army. </p>

<p>Yahweh said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of these people; I have put them at your mercy; not one of them will put up any resistance”. Having marched from Gilgal throughout the night, Joshua caught them unawares. </p>

<h4>Aid from on high (10:10–15)</h4>

<p>Yahweh threw them into disorder at the sight of Israel, defeating them completely at Gibeon; furthermore, he pursued them by way of the Descent of Beth-Horon and harassed them as far as Azekah (and as far as Makkedah). And as they fled from Israel down the Descent of Beth-Horon, Yahweh hurled huge hailstones from heaven on them all the way to Azekah, and they died. More of them died under the hailstones than under the swords of the Israelites. Joshua then spoke to Yahweh, the day Yahweh delivered the Amorites to the Israelites. In the presence of Israel, Joshua said: </p>

<blockquote>Sun, stand still over Gibeon, <br />
and, moon, you too, over the Vale of Aijalon! </blockquote>

<p>And the sun stood still, and the moon halted, until the people had taken vengeance on their enemies. </p>

<p>Is this not written in the Book of the Just? The sun stood still in the middle of the sky and delayed its setting for almost a whole day. There was never a day like that before or since, when Yahweh obeyed the voice of a man — for Yahweh was fighting for Israel. Joshua, and all Israel with him, then went back to the camp at Gilgal. </p>

<h4>The five kings in the cave at Makkedah (10:16–27)</h4>

<p>As regards the five kings, these had fled and hidden in the cave of Makkedah, and news of this was brought to Joshua. “The five kings have been found hiding in the cave at Makkedah”. </p>

<p>Joshua said, “Roll great stones over the mouth of the cave and post men there to keep guard. You yourselves, do not stay there doing nothing; pursue the enemy, cut off their line of retreat and do not let them enter their towns, for Yahweh your God has put them at your mercy”. </p>

<p>When Joshua and the Israelites had finished inflicting a very great defeat on them, to the point of destroying them, those who had escaped alive took refuge in their fortresses. The people came back to Joshua’s camp at Makkedah; they were all safe and sound, and no one dared to attempt anything against the Israelites. </p>

<p>Joshua then said, “Clear the mouth of the cave and bring the five kings out to me”. They did so, and brought the five kings out of the cave to take them to him: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish and the king of Eglon. When these kings had been brought out, Joshua assembled all the men of Israel and said to the chiefs of the warriors who had fought with him, “Come forward and put your feet on the necks of these kings!”. They came forward and put their feet on their necks. “Be fearless and undaunted”, Joshua went on, “be strong and stand firm, for this is how Yahweh will deal with all the enemies you fight”. With this, Joshua struck and killed them and had them hanged on five trees; they hung there until evening. </p>

<p>At the hour of sunset, on Joshua’s orders, they were taken down from the trees and thrown into the cave where they had been hiding. Great stones were laid over the mouth of the cave, and these are still there to this very day. </p>

<h4>The conquest of the southern towns of Canaan (10:28–39)</h4>

<p>The same day Joshua captured Makkedah, putting it and its king to the sword; he delivered them over to the curse of destruction, with every living creature there, and let no one escape, and he treated the king of Makkedah as he had treated the king of Jericho. </p>

<p>Joshua, and all Israel with him, went on from Makkedah to Libnah and attacked it and Yahweh put this, too, and its king at Israel’s mercy; and Israel put every living creature there to the sword, and left none alive, and treated its king like the king of Jericho. </p>

<p>Joshua, and all Israel with him, went on from Libnah to Lachish and besieged it and attacked it. Yahweh put Lachish at Israel’s mercy, and Israel took it on the second day and put it and every living creature in it to the sword, as they had treated Libnah. Horam king of Gezer then marched up to help Lachish, but Joshua beat him and his people until not one was left alive. </p>

<p>Joshua, and all Israel with him, went on from Lachish to Eglon. They besieged it and attacked it. The same day they took it and put it to the sword. That day he delivered over to the curse of destruction every living creature there, treating it as he had treated Lachish. </p>

<p>Joshua, and all Israel with him, went on up from Eglon to Hebron. They attacked it, took it and put it to the sword, with its king, its dependencies and every living creature in it. As he had treated Eglon, so here, he left no one alive. He delivered it over to the curse of destruction, with every living creature in it. </p>

<p>Joshua, and all Israel with him, then turned back on Debir and attacked it. He took it and its king and all the places belonging to it; they put them to the sword, and every living creature there they delivered over to the curse of destruction. He left no one alive. As he had treated Hebron, as he had treated Libnah and its king, so he treated Debirand its king. </p>

<h4>The southern conquests recapitulated (10:40–43)</h4>

<p>Thus Joshua subjugated the whole country: the highlands, the Negeb, the lowlands and watered foothills, and all their kings. He left not one survivor and put every living thing under the curse of destruction, as Yahweh, God of Israel, had commanded. Joshua conquered them from Kadesh-Barnea to Gaza, and the whole region of Goshen as far as Gibeon. All these kings and their territory Joshua captured in a single campaign, because Yahweh, God of Israel, fought for Israel. And then Joshua, and all Israel with him, went back to the camp at Gilgal. </p>

<h3 id="ih">H: The Conquest of the North (11:1–23)</h3>

<p>When Jabin king of Hazor heard about this, he sent word to Jobab king of Merom, to the king of Shimron, to the king of Achshaph and to the kings in the northern highlands, in the plain south of Chinneroth, and those in the lowlands and on the slopes of Dor to the west. To eastward and to westward lived the Canaanites: in the highlands, the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites and Jebusites; the Hivites, at the foot of Hermon in the area of Mizpah. They set out with all their troops, a people as numerous as the sands of the sea, with a huge number of horses and chariots. </p>

<h4>The victory at Merom (11:5–9)</h4>

<p>These kings, having all agreed on a meeting place, came and set up camp together at the Waters of Merom, to fight Israel. Yahweh then said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of them, for by this time tomorrow I shall hand them all over, cut to pieces, to Israel; you will hamstring their horses and burn their chariots”. With all his warriors Joshua caught them unawares near the Waters of Merom and fell on them. Yahweh put them at Israel’s mercy and they defeated them and pursued them as far as Sidon the Great, and as far as Misrephoth to the west, and as far as the Vale of Mizpah to the east; they harried them until not one of them was left alive. Joshua treated them as Yahweh had told him; he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots. </p>

<h4>The capture of Hazor and of the other northern towns (11:10–14)</h4>

<p>Joshua then turned back and captured Hazor, putting its king to the sword. Hazor in olden days was the capital of all these kingdoms. In compliance with the curse of destruction, they put every living creature there to the sword. Not a living soul was left, and Hazor was burnt to the ground. All these royal cities and all their kings Joshua put to the sword in compliance with the curse of destruction, as Moses, servant of Yahweh, had ordered. Yet of all these towns standing on their mounds, Israel burned none, apart from Hazor, burnt by Joshua. All the spoils of these towns, including the livestock, the Israelites took as booty for themselves. But they put all the human beings to the sword until they had destroyed them completely; they did not leave a living soul. </p>

<h4>The orders of Moses carried out by Joshua (11:15–20)</h4>

<p>What Yahweh had ordered his servant Moses, Moses in turn had ordered Joshua, and Joshua carried it out, leaving nothing undone of what Yahweh had ordered Moses. In consequence, Joshua captured this entire country: the highlands, the whole Negeb and the whole of Goshen, the lowlands, the Arabah, the highlands and lowlands of Israel. </p>

<p>From Mount Halak, which rises towards Seir, to Baal-Gad in the Vale of Lebanon at the foot of Mount Hermon, he captured all their kings, struck them down and put them to death. For many a day Joshua made war on all these kings; no city had made peace with the Israelites except the Hivites who lived at Gibeon; all the rest had been captured in battle. For Yahweh had decided to harden the hearts of these men, so that they would engage Israel in battle and thus come under the curse of destruction and so receive no quarter but be exterminated, as Yahweh had ordered Moses. </p>

<h4>Extermination of the Anakim (11:21–23)</h4>

<p>Joshua then went and wiped out the Anakim of the highlands, of Hebron, of Debir, of Anab, of all the highlands of Judah and of all the highlands of Israel; he delivered them and their towns over to the curse of destruction. No Anakim were left in the territory of the Israelites, except at Gaza, Gath and Ashdod. Joshua captured the entire country, just as Yahweh had told Moses, and he gave it as heritage to Israel, to be shared out between their tribes. </p>

<p>And the country had rest from warfare. </p>

<h3 id="iI">Recapitulation (12:1–24)</h3>

<h4>The kings conquered east of the Jordan (12:1–6)</h4>

<p>The kings of the country, whom the Israelites conquered and whose territory they took, on the further, eastern side of the Jordan, from the Wadi Arnon to Mount Hermon, with the entire Arabah to the east, were as follows: </p>

<p>Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon, ruled from Aroer which is on the edge of the Arnon Valley, including the bottom of the valley, half Gilead and as far as the Jabbok, the river forming the frontier with the Ammonites; the eastern Arabah up to the Sea of Chinneroth, and as far as the Sea of the Arabah, or Salt Sea, on the eastern side, in the direction of Beth-Jeshimoth, and, in the south, the watered foothills of Mount Pisgah. </p>

<p>Og king of Bashan, one of the last of the Rephaim, who lived at Ashtaroth and Edrei, ruled over Mount Hermon and Salecah, the whole of Bashan to the frontier of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and half Gilead to the frontier of Sihon king of Heshbon. </p>

<p>Moses, servant of Yahweh, and the Israelites conquered these, and Moses, servant of Yahweh, conferred their territory on the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh. </p>

<h4>The kings conquered west of the Jordan (12:7–24)</h4>

<p>The kings of the country whom Joshua and the Israelites conquered on the nearer, western side of the Jordan, from Baal-Gad in the Vale of Lebanon to Mount Halak rising towards Seir, and whose heritage Joshua distributed to the tribes of Israel, dividing it up between them, were as follows: </p>

<p>In the highlands and the lowlands, in the Arabah and in the watered foothills, in the desert and in the Negeb, belonging to the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites: </p>

Total number of all these kings:&#9;&#9;thirty-one.
</p>

<h2 id="ii">II. Distribution of the Country Among the Tribes (13:1–21:45)</h2>

<h4>Lands remaining unconquered (13:1–7)</h4>

<p>Now Joshua had grown old and advanced in years. Yahweh said to him, “You are now old and advanced in years, yet there is still a great deal of territory left to be taken possession of. This is all the territory left: </p>

<p>“All the districts of the Philistines and the whole country of the Geshurites; from the Shihor, facing Egypt, to the frontier of Ekron in the north, is reckoned as Canaanite territory. The five rulers of the Philistines have their seats at Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath and Ekron, respectively; the
Avvites are in the south. The entire territory of the Canaanites, and Mearah which belongs to the Sidonians, as far as Aphekah and as far as the frontier of the Amorites; and then the country of the Gebalites with the entire Lebanon eastwards from Baal-Gad at the foot of Mount Hermon to the Pass of Hamath. </p>

<p>“All who live in the highlands from the Lebanon to Misrephoth in the west — all the Sidonians — I myself shall dispossess before the Israelites. All you have to do is to distribute the territory as a heritage for the Israelites as I have ordered you. The time has come to divide this territory as a heritage between the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh: from the Jordan as far as the Great Sea in the west, you must give it them; the Great Sea will be their limit”. </p>

<h3 id="iia">A: Description of the Transjordanian Tribes (13:8–33)</h3>

<h4>A general survey (13:8–14)</h4>

<p>As regards the other half-tribe of Manasseh, this and the Reubenites and Gadites had already received their heritage, given them by Moses on the further, eastern side of the Jordan, the one which Moses, servant of Yahweh, had already given them: The country onwards from Aroer on the edge of the Arnon Valley, with the town in the bottom of the valley and the entire tableland from Medeba to Dibon; all the towns of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had reigned in Heshbon, to the frontier of the Ammonites; then Gilead and the territory of the Geshurites and Maacathites with the whole Hermon range and the whole of Bashan as far as Salecah; and in Bashan, the whole kingdom of Og, who had reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei, and was the last of the survivors of the Rephaim. Moses had conquered and dispossessed these two kings. The Israelites did not, however, dispossess either the Geshurites or the Maacathites, hence Geshur and Maacah survive inside Israel even today. </p>

<p>To the tribe of Levi alone no heritage was given; Yahweh, God of Israel, was his heritage, as he had told him. </p>

<h4>The tribe of Reuben (13:15–23)</h4>

<p>Moses had given the tribe of the sons of Reuben a share by clans. Thus, their territory was the entire tableland from Aroer on the edge of the Arnon Valley, with the town in the bottom of the valley, as far as Medeba, Heshbon with all the towns on the tableland: Dibon, Bamoth-Baal, Beth-Baal-Meon, Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath, Kiriathaim, Sibmah and, in the highlands of the Arabah, Zereth-Shahar; Beth-Peor, the watered foothills of Mount Pisgah, Beth-ha-Jeshimoth, all the towns on the tableland and the entire kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had reigned in Heshbon; he had been defeated by Moses, and with him the princes of Midian, Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and Reba, vassals of Sihon, formerly living in the country. </p>

<p>As regards Balaam son of Beor, the soothsayer, the Israelites had put him to the sword with those whom they had killed. </p>

<p>The boundary of the Reubenites was the Jordan and its territory. </p>

<p>Such was the heritage of the sons of Reuben, by clans, with the towns and villages belonging to them. </p>

<h4>The tribe of Gad (13:24–28)</h4>

<p>Moses had given the tribe of Gad, the sons of Gad, a share by clans. Their territory was Jazer, all the towns of Gilead, half the country of the Ammonites as far as Aroer facing Rabbah, and from Heshbon to Ramath-Mizpeh and Betonim; from Mahanaim as far as the territory of Lo-Debar, and in the valley: Beth-Haram, Beth-Nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon — the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon — the Jordan and the territory running to the tip of the Sea of Chinneroth, on the further, eastern side of the Jordan. </p>

<p>Such was the heritage of the sons of Gad, by clans, with their towns and villages belonging to them. </p>

<h4>The half-tribe of Manasseh (13:29–33)</h4>

<p>Moses had given the half-tribe of Manasseh a share by clans. Their territory, starting from Mahanaim, was the whole of Bashan, the entire kingdom of Og king of Bashan, all the Encampments of Jair in Bashan: sixty towns. Half of Gilead, with Ashtaroth, and Edrei, the royal cities of Og in Bashan, were allotted to the sons of Machir son of Manasseh, to half of the sons of Machir, by clans. </p>

<p>This was what Moses had conferred in heritage on the Plains of Moab on the further, eastern side of the Jordan opposite Jericho. To the tribe of Levi, however, Moses gave no heritage; Yahweh, God of Israel, was his heritage, as he had told him. </p>

<h3 id="iib">B: Description of the Three Large Tribes to the West of the Jordan (14:1–17:18)</h3>

<h4>Introduction (14:1–5)</h4>

<p>This was what the Israelites received as their heritage in Canaan, which was given them as their heritage by the priest, Eleazar, and by Joshua son of Nun, with the heads of families of the tribes of Israel. They received their heritage by lot, as Yahweh had ordered through Moses, as regards the nine tribes and the half-tribe. For Moses himself had given the two-and-a-half tribes their heritage on the further side of the Jordan, although to the Levites he had given no heritage with them. Since the sons of Joseph formed two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim, no share in the country was given to the Levites, apart from some towns to live in, with their pasture lands for their livestock and their possessions. The Israelites did as Yahweh had ordered Moses, and shared out the country. </p>

<h4>Caleb’s share (14:6–15)</h4>

<p>Some sons of Judah came to Joshua at Gilgal, and Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, “You know what Yahweh said to Moses, man of God, at Kadesh-Barnea concerning you and me. I was forty years old when Moses, servant of Yahweh, sent me from Kadesh-Barnea to reconnoitre this country, and I made him a completely honest report. The brothers, however, who had gone up with me discouraged the people, whereäs I myself scrupulously obeyed Yahweh my God. That day Moses swore this oath, ‘Be sure of this, that the country your foot has trodden will be a heritage for you and your children for ever, since you have scrupulously obeyed Yahweh my God’. From then until now, Yahweh has kept me alive in observance of his promise. It is forty-five years since Yahweh said this to Moses — Israel was then going through the desert — and now I am eighty-five years old. Today I am still as strong as the day when Moses sent me out on that errand; for fighting, for going and coming, I am as strong now as then. It is time you gave me the highlands, of which Yahweh spoke to me that day. You heard that day that there were Anakim and large, fortified towns there; but if Yahweh is with me, I shall drive them out, as Yahweh has said”. </p>

<p>Joshua blessed Caleb son of Jephunneh and gave him Hebron as heritage. And hence Hebron down to the present day has remained the heritage of Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, since he had scrupulously obeyed Yahweh, God of Israel. Hebron in olden days was called Kiriath-Arba. Arba had been the greatest of the Anakim. </p>

<p>And the country had rest from warfare.</p>

<h4>The tribe of Judah (15:1–12)</h4>

<p>The portion falling to the tribe of the sons of Judah, by clans, was near the frontier of Edom, from the desert of Zin southwards to Kadesh in the south. Their southern frontier began at the tip of the Salt Sea, at the southerly bay; it proceeded south of the Ascent of Scorpions, crossed Zin and came up to Kadesh-Barnea from the south; past Hezron, it went on to Addar and turned towards Karka; the frontier then went on to Azmon, came out at the Torrent of Egypt and reached as far as the sea. This is to be your southern frontier. </p>

<p>The eastern frontier was the Salt Sea as far as the mouth of the Jordan. </p>

<p>The northern boundary began at the bay at the mouth of the Jordan. The boundary went up to Beth-Hoglah, passed north of Beth-ha-Arabah and went on to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben. The boundary then went on to Debir from the Vale of Achor and turned north towards the stone circle opposite the Ascent of Adummim, which is south of the Torrent; the boundary went on to the Waters of En-Shemesh and came out at En-Rogel. It then went back up the Valley of Hinnom, coming from the south to the flank of the Jebusite — that is, Jerusalem — and climbed to the crest of the mountain barring the Valley of Hinnom to the west, at the northern end of the Valley of the Rephaim. From the mountain top, the boundary curved round to the spring of the Waters of Nephtoah, went on to the towns of Mount Ephron and then turned towards Baalah — that is, Kiriath-Jearim. From Baalah, the boundary curved westwards to the highlands of Seir, skirted the northern slope of Mount Jearim — that is, Chesalon — went down to Beth-Shemesh and through Timnah, came out on the northern flank of Ekron, turned towards Shikkeron and, passing through the highlands of Baalah, came out at Jabneel, and reached as far as the sea. </p>

<p>The western boundary was the Great Sea itself. Such was the frontier surrounding the sons of Judah, by clans. </p>

<h4>The Calebites occupy the territory of Hebron (15:13–20)</h4>

<p>Caleb son of Jephunneh was given a share within that of the sons of Judah, in accordance with Yahweh’s order to Joshua: Kiriath-Arba, the town of the father of Anak — that is, Hebron. Caleb drove out the three sons of Anak: Sheshai, Ahiman and Talmai, descended from Anak. From there he marched on the inhabitants of Debir; Debir in olden days was called Kiriath-Sepher. Caleb then said, “To the man who attacks and takes Kiriath-Sepher, I shall give my daughter Achsah as wife”. The man who captured it was Othniel son of Kenaz, brother of Caleb, who gave him his daughter Achsah as wife. When she arrived, he urged her to ask her father for arable land, but when she alighted from the
donkey and Caleb asked her, “What is the matter?”, she said to him, “Grant me a blessing! As the land you have given me is the Negeb, give me springs
of water too!”. So Caleb gave her what she wanted, the upper springs and the lower springs. </p>

<p>Such was the heritage of the tribe of the sons of Judah, by clans. </p>

<h4>Names of places owned by Judah (15:21–63)</h4>

<p>Towns at the extremity of the tribe of the sons of Judah, near the frontier of Edom in the Negeb: </p>

<p>Kabzeel, Arad, Jagur, Kinah, Dimon, Aroer, Kedesh, Hazor-lthnan, Ziph, Telem, Bealoth, Hazor-Hadattah, Kiriath-Hezron — that is, Hazor-Jos  Amam, Shema, Moladah, Hazar-Gaddah, Heshmon, Beth-Pelet, Hazar-Shual, Beersheba and its dependencies, Baalah, lim, Ezem, Eltolad, Chesil, Hormah, Ziklag, Madmannah, Sansannah, Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain and Rimmon: in all, twenty-nine towns with their villages. </p>

<p>In the lowlands: </p>

<p>Eshtaol, Zorah, Ashnah, Zanoah, En-Gannim, Tappuah, Enam, Jarmuth, Adullam, Socoh, Azekah, Shaaraim, Aditaim, Ha-Gederah and Gederothaim: fourteen towns with their villages. </p>

<p>Zenan, Hadashah, Migdal-Gad, Dilean, Ha-Mizpeh, Jokteel, Lachish, Bozkath, Eglon, Cabbon, Lahmas, Chitlish, Gederoth, Beth-Dagon, Naamah and Makkedah: sixteen towns with their villages. </p>

<p>Libna, Ether, Asham, Iphtah, Ashnah, Nezib, Keilah, Achzib and Mareshah: nine towns with their villages. </p>

<p>Ekron with its dependencies and its villages. From Ekron to the sea, everything to the side of Ashdod, with its villages. Ashdod with its dependencies and its villages; Gaza with its dependencies and its villages as far as the Torrent of Egypt, the Great Sea forming the boundary. </p>

<p>In the highlands: </p>

<p>Shamir, Jattir, Socoh, Dannah, Kiriath-Sepher, now Debir, Anab, Eshtemoh, Anim, Goshen, Holon and Giloh: eleven towns with their villages. </p>

<p>Arab, Dumah, Eshan, Janum, Beth-Tappuah, Aphekah, Humtah, Kiriath-Arba, now Hebron, and Zior: nine towns with their villages. </p>

<p>Maon, Carmel, Ziph, Juttah, Jezreel, Jokdeam, Zanoah, Ha-Kain, Gibeah and Timnah: ten towns with their villages. </p>

<p>Halhul, Beth-Zur, Gedor, Maarath, Beth-Anoth and Eltekon: six towns with their villages. </p>

<p>Tekoa, Ephrathah, now Bethlehem, Peor, Etam, Kulon, Tatam, Sores, Carem, Gallim, Betherand Manach: eleven towns with their villages. </p>

<p>Kiriath-Baal, that is Kiriath-Jearim, and Rabbah: two towns with their villages. </p>

<p>In the desert: </p>

<p>Beth-Arabah, Middin, Secacah, Nibshan, Salt Town and En-Gedi: six towns with their villages. </p>

<p>The Jebusites, however, who lived in Jerusalem, the sons of Judah were unable to dispossess, and the Jebusites still live in Jerusalem today, side by side with the sons of Judah. </p>

<h4>The tribe of Ephraim (16:1–10)</h4>

<p>The portion of the sons of Joseph started on the east at the Jordan opposite Jericho (the Waters of Jericho) through the desert rising from Jericho into the highlands of Bethel; from Bethel it went to Luz, and on towards the frontier of the Archites at Ataroth; then passed downwards and westwards to the frontier of the Japhletites as far as the border of Lower Beth-Horon and on to Gezer, and reached as far as the sea. </p>

<p>Such was the heritage of the sons of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim. As regards the territory of the sons of Ephraim, by clans, the frontier of their heritage ran from Ataroth-Arach to Upper Beth-Horon; the frontier then reached as far as the sea ... the Michmethath in the north, and the frontier turned east to Tanaath-Shiloh which it crossed in an easterly direction to Janoah; it ran down to Ataroth and Naarah, touched Jericho and ended at the Jordan. From Tappuah, the frontier ran westwards to the Torrent of Kanah and reached as far as the sea. </p>

<p>Such was the heritage of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim, by clans, apart from the towns reserved for the sons of Ephraim inside the heritage of the sons of Manasseh, all these towns and their villages. The Canaanites living in Gezer were not driven out; they have remained in Ephraim to the present
day but are obliged to do forced labour. </p>

<h4>The tribe of Manasseh (17:1–13)</h4>

<p>The portion of the tribe of Manasseh, who was in fact Joseph’s first-born — went to Machir, Manasseh’s first-born, father of Gilead, for he was a warrior; he had Gilead and Bashan. The other sons of Manasseh had theirs, by clans: for the sons of Abiezer, for the sons of Helek, for the sons of Asriel, for the sons of Shechem, for the sons of Hepher, and for the sons of Shemida: these were the male children of Manasseh son of Joseph, by clans. Zelophehad son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, had no sons but only daughters, whose names were these: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah and Tirzah. These approached the priest Eleazar, Joshua son of Nun and the leaders, and said, “Yahweh ordered Moses to give us a heritage among our brothers”. In compliance with Yahweh’s order, therefore, they were given a heritage among their father’s brothers. In this way ten portions fell to Manasseh, apart from Gilead and Bashan lying on the further side of the Jordan, since Manasseh’s daughters received a heritage as well as his sons. Gilead itself belonged to Manasseh’s other sons. </p>

<p>On the side of Asher, the frontier of Manasseh was the Michmethath, which is opposite Shechem, and thence continued to the right to Jashib, which is at the spring of Tappuah. The territory of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but Tappuah on Manasseh’s border belonged to the sons of Ephraim. The boundary went down to the Torrent of Kanah; south of the Torrent were the towns of Ephraim, excluding those owned by Ephraim among the towns of Manasseh; the boundary of Manasseh was north of the Torrent and reached as far as the sea. The south belonged to Ephraim and the north to Manasseh and reached as far as the sea; they touched Asher to the north and Issachar to the east. With Issachar and Asher, Manasseh shared Beth-Shean and its dependent towns, Ibleam and its dependent towns, the inhabitants of Dor and of its dependent towns, the inhabitants of Taanach and Megiddo and of their dependent towns: the Three of the Slopes. But because the sons of Manasseh could not take possession of these towns, the Canaanites managed to live on in that territory. When, however, the Israelites became stronger, they subjected the Canaanites to forced labour, though they never dispossessed them. </p>

<h4>Land reclamation by the sons of Joseph (17:14–18)</h4>

<p>The sons of Joseph spoke as follows to Joshua, “Why have you given me only one share, only one portion, as heritage, when I am a numerous people, since Yahweh has so blessed me?”. </p>

<p>Joshua replied, “If your people are so many, go up to the wooded area and clear space for yourselves in the area belonging to the Perizzites and Rephaim, since the highlands of Ephraim are too small for you”. </p>

<p>The sons of Joseph replied, “The highlands are not enough for us, and what is more, all the Canaanites living on the land of the plain have iron chariots, so do those in Beth-Shean and its dependent towns, and those in the plain of Jezreel”. </p>

<p>Joshua said to the House of Joseph, to Ephraim and to Manasseh, “You are a numerous people and your strength is great; you will not only have one share, but a mountain will be yours as well; even if it is a forest, you can clear it and its territories will be yours. And you will dispossess the Canaanites, although they have iron chariots and although they are strong”. </p>

<h3 id="iic">C: Description of the Seven Other Tribes (18:1–19:51)</h3>

<h4>The land survey for the seven tribes (18:1–10)</h4>

<p>The whole community of the Israelites assembled at Shiloh, and the Tent of Meeting was set up there; the whole country had been subdued for them. But among the Israelites there were still seven tribes left who had not received their heritage. Joshua then said to the Israelites, “How much more time are you going to waste before you go and take possession of the country which Yahweh, God of your ancestors, has given to you? Choose three men from each tribe for me to send all over the country so that they can make a survey with a view to their inheritances and then come back to me. They will divide the country into seven portions. Judah will remain in his territory in the south, and those of the House of Joseph will remain in their territory in the north. You must survey the country in seven sections and bring your findings to me here, so that I can cast lots for you here, in the presence of Yahweh our God. The Levites, however, will have no portion with the rest of you; the priesthood of Yahweh will be their heritage. As regards Gad and Reuben and the half-tribe of Manasseh, they have received their heritage on the further, eastern side of the Jordan, the one given them by Moses, servant of Yahweh”. </p>

<p>The men stood up and set off. To those who were to survey the country Joshua gave this order, “Start out, then, go all over the country, survey it, and then come back to me; and I shall cast lots for you here, in the presence of Yahweh, at Shiloh”. The men left, went all over the country and surveyed it by towns, in seven sections, writing down their findings in a book, and then went back to Joshua in the camp at Shiloh. </p>

<p>Joshua cast lots for them in Yahweh’s presence at Shiloh, and there Joshua divided the country between the Israelites, share by share. </p>

<h4>The tribe of Benjamin (18:11–20)</h4>

<p>A portion fell first to the tribe of the sons of Benjamin, by clans: the territory of their portion lay between the sons of Judah and the sons of Joseph. Their northern frontier began at the Jordan, went up the flank of Jericho to the north, climbed westwards through the highlands and came out at the desert of Beth-Aven. Thence, the frontier went on to Luz, on the southern flank of Luz — now Bethel-and then down to Ataroth-Arach, on the mountain south of Lower Beth-Horon. At this westerly point, the frontier curved round and turned south, from the mountain facing Beth-Horon from the south and came out at Kiriath-Baal, now Kiriath-Jearim, a town of the sons of Judah. That was the western side. </p>

<p>This was the south side: from the tip of Kiriath-Jearim, the frontier went to Gasin and came out near the spring of the Waters of Nephtoah, it then went down to the edge of the mountain facing the Valley of Hinnom, in the Valley of the Rephaim to the north; it then went down into the Valley of Hinnom, past the southerly flank of the Jebusite, and went down to En-Rogel. It then curved northwards, coming out at En-Shemesh, and came out at the stone circle opposite the Ascent of Adummim, then went down to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben. It then went on to Cheteph on the flank of Beth-ha-Arabah northwards, and went down into the Arabah; the frontier then passed round the northern flank of Beth-Hoglah, and the frontier came out at the northern bay of the Salt Sea, at the southern end of the Jordan. Such was the southern frontier. The Jordan itself formed the frontier on the east. </p>

<p>Such was the heritage of the sons of Benjamin as defined by their frontier, by clans.</p>

<h4>The towns of Benjamin (18:21–28)</h4>

<p>The towns of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin, by clans, were: </p>

<p>Jericho, Beth-Hoglah, Emek-Keziz; Beth-Arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel; Avvim, Parah, Ophrah; Chephar-Ammoni, Ophni, Geba: twelve towns and their villages. </p>

<p>Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth; Mizpeh, Chephirah, Mozah; Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah; Zela-ha-Eleph, the Jebusite — that is, Jerusalem — Gibeah and Kiriath: fourteen towns with their villages. </p>

<p>Such was the heritage of the sons of Benjamin, by clans. </p>

<h4>The tribe of Simeon (19:1–9)</h4>

<p>The second lot to come out was for Simeon, for the tribe of the sons of Simeon, by clans; their heritage was within the heritage of the sons of Judah. As heritage, they received: </p>

<p>Beersheba, Shema, Moladah, Hazar-Shual, Balah, Ezem, Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah, Ziklag, Beth-ha-Marcaboth, Hazar-Susa, Beth-Lebaoth and Sharuhen: thirteen towns and their villages. </p>

<p>Ain, Rimmon, Ether and Ashan: four towns and their villages, with all the villages situated near these towns as far as Baalath-Beer and Ramah of the Negeb. </p>

<p>Such was the heritage of the tribe of the sons of Simeon, by clans. The heritage of the sons of Simeon was taken out of the portion of the sons of Judah, because the share of the sons of Judah was too large for them; hence, the sons of Simeon received their heritage within the heritage of the sons of Judah. </p>

<h4>The tribe of Zebulun (19:10–16)</h4>

<p>The third lot fell to the sons of Zebulun, by clans; the territory of their heritage stretched as far as Sadud; their frontier climbed westwards to Maraalah, touching Dabbesheth and the torrent facing Jokneam. From Sadud, the frontier turned east, towards the rising sun, as far as the frontier of Chisloth-Tabor; it came out at Dobrath and went up to Japhia. Thence, it went east, towards the sunrise, to Gath-Hepher and Ittah-Kazin, came out at Rimmon and turned towards Neah. The northern frontier turned towards Hannathon and came to an end in the Valley of Iphtah-EI; with Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Iralah and Bethlehem: twelve towns with their villages. </p>

<p>Such was the heritage of the sons of Zebulun, by clans: these towns with their villages.</p>

<h4>The tribe of Issachar (10:17–23)</h4>

<p>The fourth lot came out for Issachar, for the sons of Issachar, by clans. Their territory stretched towards Jezreel and included Chesulloth, Shunem, Hapharaim, Shion, Anaharath, Dobrath, Kishion, Ebez, Remeth, En-Gannim, En-Haddah and Beth-Pazzez. Their frontier touched Tabor, Shahazimah and Beth-Shemesh, and the frontier came to an end at the Jordan: sixteen towns with their villages. </p>

<p>Such was the heritage of the tribe of the sons of Issachar, by clans: the towns and their villages. </p>

<h4>The tribe of Asher (19:24–31)</h4>

<p>The fifth lot came out for the tribe of the sons of Asher, by clans. Their territory included Helkath, Hali, Beten, Achshaph, Alammelech, Amad and Mishal. On the west, it touched Carmel and the course of the Libnath. On the side of the rising sun, it went as far as Beth-Dagon, touched Zebulun, the Valley of Iphtah-EI on the north side, Beth-ha-Emek and Neiel, coming out with Cabul on the left, with Abdon, Rehob, Hammon and Kanah as far as Sidon the Great. The frontier then turned towards Ramah, as far as the fortress-town of Tyre; the frontier then went to Hosah and reached as far as the sea at Mahalab and Achzib, with Acco, Aphek and Rehob: twenty-two towns with their villages. </p>

<p>Such was the heritage of the tribe of the sons of Asher, by clans; these towns and their villages. </p>
<hr />
Jos 19:32 To the sons of Naphtali fell the sixth portion, to the sons of Naphtali, by clans.

Jos 1 9:33 Their frontier went from Heleph and the Oak of Zanaannim, with Adami-ha-Negeb and Jabneel, as far
as Lakkum, and ended at the Jordan.

Jos 19:34 The westward boundary ran to Aznoth-Tabor and thence came out at Hukkok, marching with Zebulun
in the south, Asher in the west and the Jordan in the east.

Jos 19:35 The fortified towns were Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Chinnereth,

Jos 19:36 Adamah, Ramah, Hazor,

Jos 19:37 Kedesh, Edrei, En-Hazor,

Jos 19:38 Jiron, Migdal-EI, Horem, Beth-Anath and Beth-Shemesh: nineteen towns and their villages.

Jos 1 9:39 Such was the heritage of the sons of Naphtali, by clans: the towns and their villages.

Jos 19:40 To the tribe of the sons of Dan, by clans, fell the seventh portion.

Jos 19:41 The territory of their heritage comprised: Zorah, Eshtaol, Ir-Shemesh,

Jos 19:42 Shaalbim, Aijalon, Silatha,

Jos 19:43 Elon, Timnah, Ekron,

Jos 19:44 Eltekeh, Gibbethon,

Jos 19:45 Baalath, Azor, Bene-Berak and Gath-Rimmon;

Jos 19:46 and, by the sea, Jerakon with the territory facing Jaffa.

Jos 19:47 The territory of the sons of Dan eluded them, however, and the sons of Dan consequently went up
and attacked Leshem, captured it and put it to the sword. Having gained possession of it, they settled there and
called Leshem, Dan, after Dan their ancestor.

Jos 1 9:48 Such was the heritage of the tribe of the sons of Dan, by clans: these towns and their villages.

Jos 19:49 Having finished dividing the country, frontier by frontier, the Israelites gave Joshua son of Nun a
heritage among themselves;

Jos 19:50 at Yahweh’s command, they gave him the town which he had asked for, Timnath-Serah in the
highlands of Ephraim; he rebuilt the town and settled there.

Jos 1 9:51 Such are the heritages which the priest Eleazar, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of each family
apportioned by lot between the tribes of Israel at Shiloh, in Yahweh’s presence, at the door of the Tent of
Meeting; and thus the apportioning of the country was completed.

Jos 20:1 Yahweh said to Joshua,

Jos 20:2 “Speak to the Israelites and say to them, ‘Choose yourselves the cities of refuge of which I spoke to
you through Moses,

Jos 20:3 to which anyone who has accidentally (unintentionally) killed someöne else may flee, and which will
serve you as refuge from the avenger of blood.

Jos 20:4 (The killer must flee to one of these towns. He will stop at the entrance to the town gate and explain his
case to the town elders. These will admit him to their town and assign him a place to live among them.

Jos 20:5 If the avenger of blood pursues him, they must not hand the killer over to him, since he has killed his
fellow unintentionally and was not motivated by long-standing hatred for him.

Jos 20:6 He must stay in this town) until he is brought to trial before the community (until the death of the high
priest then in office. Only then may the killer go back to his own town and to his own house in the town from
which he has fled)’.

Jos 20:7 For this purpose they designated Kedesh in Galilee, in the highlands of Naphtali, Shechem in the
highlands of Ephraim, and Kiriath-Arba — now Hebron — in the highlands of Judah.

Jos 20:8 On the other, eastern, side of the Jordan opposite Jericho, in the desert of the tableland, they chose
Bezer of the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead of the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan of the tribe of
Manasseh.

Jos 20:9 Such were the towns designated for all the Israelites and for foreigners living among them, so that
anyone who had accidentally killed someöne could flee there and might escape the hand of the avenger of
blood, until brought to trial before the community.

Jos 21:1 The heads of families of the Levites then came to the priest, Eleazar, Joshua son of Nun and the
heads of families of the tribes of Israel-



Jos 21 :2 they were then at Shiloh in Canaan. They said to them, Through Moses, Yahweh ordered us to be
given towns to live in, with their pasture lands for our livestock”.

Jos 21 :3 In compliance with Yahweh’s order, the Israelites consequently and from their own heritage gave the
Levites the following towns with their pasture lands:

Jos 21 :4 Lots were cast for the clans of the Kohathites: to those Levites who were sons of Aaron the priest, fell
thirteen towns from the tribes of Judah, Simeon and Benjamin;

Jos 21 :5 to the other sons of Kohath, by clans,

Jos 21 :6 fell ten towns from the tribes of Ephraim, Dan, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. To the sons of Gershon,
by clans, fell thirteen towns from the tribes of Issachar, Asher, Naphtali and the half-tribe of Manasseh in
Bashan.

Jos 21 :7 To the sons of Merari, by clans, fell twelve towns from the tribes of Reuben, Gad and Zebulun.

Jos 21 :8 The Israelites assigned these towns and their pasture lands to the Levites by lot, as Yahweh had
ordered through Moses.

Jos 21 :9 From the tribe of Judah and the tribe of Simeon, they gave the towns named below.

Jos 21:10 The first portion was for the sons of Aaron, belonging to the clans of the Kohathites, to the sons of
Levi, since the first lot was theirs.

Jos 21:11 They gave them Kiriath-Arba, Anak’s father’s town — now Hebron — in the highlands of Judah, with its
surrounding pasture lands.

Jos 21:12 The fields and villages of this town, however, they gave to Caleb son of Jephunneh as his property.
Jos 21:13 To the sons of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron, a city of refuge for those who had killed, with its
pasture lands, as well as Libnah with its pasture lands,

Jos 21:14 Jattir with its pasture lands, Eshtemoa with its pasture lands,

Jos 21:15 Holon with its pasture lands, Debir with its pasture lands,

Jos 21:16 Ashan with its pasture lands, Juttah with its pasture lands, and Beth-Shemesh with its pasture lands:
nine towns taken from these two tribes;

Jos 21:17 and, from the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with its pasture lands, Geba with its pasture lands,

Jos 21:18 Anathoth with its pasture lands and Almon with its pasture lands: four towns.

Jos 21:19 Total number of towns for the priests, the sons of Aaron: thirteen towns with their pasture lands.

Jos 21 :20 As regards the clans of the sons of Kohath, those Levites still left of the sons of Kohath, the towns of
their lot were taken from the tribe of Ephraim.

Jos 21 :21 They were given Shechem, a city of refuge for those who had killed, with its pasture lands, in the
highlands of Ephraim, as well as Gezer with its pasture lands,

Jos 21 :23 from the tribe of Dan, Elteke with its pasture lands, Gibbethon with its pasture lands,

Jos 21 :24 Aijalon with its pasture lands and Gath-Rimmon with its pasture lands: four towns;

Jos 21 :25 and, from the half-tribe of Manasseh, Taanach with its pasture lands and Jibleam with its pasture
lands: two towns.

Jos 21 :26 In all: ten towns with their pasture lands for the remaining clans of the sons of Kohath.

Jos 21 .21 To the sons of Gershon, of the levitical clans, were given: from the half-tribe of Manasseh, Golan in
Bashan, a city of refuge for those who had killed, with its pasture lands, and Ashtaroth with its pasture lands —
two towns;

Jos 21 :28 from the tribe of Issachar, Kishion with its pasture lands, Dobrath with its pasture lands,

Jos 21 :29 Jarmuth with its pasture lands and En-Gannim with its pasture lands — four towns;

Jos 21 :33 Total number of towns of the Gershonites, by clans: thirteen towns with their pasture lands.

Jos 21 :34 To the clans of the sons of Merari, the remainder of the Levites, fell: from the tribe of Zebulun,

tableland, a city of refuge for those who had killed, with its pasture lands, Jahaz with its pasture lands,

Jos 21 :3 7 Kedemoth with its pasture lands and Mephaath with its pasture lands — four towns;

lands, Mahanaim with its pasture lands,

Jos 21 :39 Heshbon with its pasture lands and Jazer with its pasture lands — four towns.

Jos 21 :40 Total number of towns forming the lot of the sons of Merari by clans, of the remaining levitical clans:
twelve towns.



Jos 21 :41 The total number of towns for the Levites in Israelite territory was forty-eight towns with their pasture
lands.

Jos 21 :42 These towns consisted in each case of the town itself and the pasture land round it. This was the
case with all the towns.

Jos 21 :43 This was how Yahweh gave the Israelites the entire country which he had sworn to give to their
ancestors. They took possession of it and settled in it.

Jos 21 :44 Yahweh granted them tranquillity on all their frontiers just as he had sworn to their ancestors and, of
all their enemies, not one succeeded in resisting them. Yahweh put all their enemies at their mercy.

Jos 21 :45 Of all the promises that Yahweh had made to the House of Israel, not one failed; all were fulfilled.

Jos 22:1 Joshua then summoned the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh

Jos 22:2 and said to them, “You have observed everything that Moses, servant of Yahweh, ordered you, and

whenever I have given you an order you have listened to me.

Jos 22:3 You have not deserted your brothers, from long ago until today, keeping the observance of the
commandment of Yahweh your God.

Jos 22:4 Now that Yahweh your God has granted your brothers the rest that he promised them, go back to your
tents, to the country belonging to you which Moses, servant of Yahweh, gave you on the other side of the
Jordan.

Jos 22:5 But take great care to practise the commandments and the Law which Moses, servant of Yahweh, has
given you: to love Yahweh your God, always to follow his paths, to keep his commandments, to be loyal to him
and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul”.

Jos 22:6 Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went home to their tents.

Jos 22:7 To one half of the tribe of Manasseh, Moses had given a territory in Bashan; to the other half, Joshua
gave another among their brothers on the west bank of the Jordan. As Joshua sent them home to their tents, he
blessed them

Jos 22:8 and said to them, “You are going back to your tents with great wealth, with a great deal of livestock,
with silver and gold, bronze and iron and great quantities of clothing; share the spoils of your enemies with your
brothers”.

Jos 22:9 The Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned home, leaving the Israelites at
Shiloh in Canaan, and made for Gilead, the territory which belonged to them as a result of Yahweh’s order given
through Moses.

Jos 22:10 When they came to the stone circle by the Jordan, in Canaanite territory, the Reubenites, the Gadites
and the half-tribe of Manasseh built an altar there beside the Jordan, a large, imposing altar.

Jos 22:1 1 This came to the ears of the Israelites. “Look”, the word went round, “the Reubenites, the Gadites and
the half-tribe of Manasseh have built this altar on the Canaanite side, near the stone circle by the Jordan, on the
Israelites’ bank”.

Jos 22:12 At this news, the whole community of the Israelites mustered at Shiloh, to march against them and
make war on them.

Jos 22:13 The Israelites sent the priest Phinehas son of Eleazar to the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-
tribe of Manasseh, in Gilead,

Jos 22:14 and with him ten leading men, one man from a leading family from each of the tribes of Israel, each of
them being head of his family in the clans of Israel.

Jos 22:15 Having reached the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh in Gilead, they said this:
Jos 22:16 “The whole community of Israel says as follows, ‘What do you mean by this infidelity, which you have
committed against the God of Israel by now repudiating your allegiance to Yahweh, and by building yourselves
an altar with the intention now of rebelling against Yahweh?

Jos 22:17 ‘Was the crime which we committed at Peor so slight — although we have not managed to purify
ourselves from that even now, in spite of the plague which has ravaged the community of Yahweh-
Jos 22:18 that you must now repudiate your allegiance to Yahweh? For since you are in rebellion against him
today, tomorrow his anger will be aroused against the whole community of Israel.

Jos 22:19 ‘Is the country in which you have settled unclean? Then cross over into the country where Yahweh
has settled, there where Yahweh’s Dwelling now stands, and settle among us. But do not rebel against Yahweh
or involve us in your rebellion by building a rival altar to the altar of Yahweh our God.

Jos 22:20 When Achan son of Zerah was unfaithful to the curse of destruction, did not the retribution come
down on the whole community of Israel, although he was only one man? Did he not have to die for his crime?’”.
Jos 22:21 The Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh spoke in their turn and answered the
heads of the clans of Israel:

Jos 22:22 “The God of gods, Yahweh, the God of gods, Yahweh well knows, and let Israel know it too: if there
has been rebellion or infidelity to Yahweh on our part, may he refuse to save us today!

Jos 22:23 And if we have built ourselves an altar with the intention of repudiating our allegiance to Yahweh and



of presenting burnt offering and oblation or of offering communion sacrifices on it, may Yahweh himself call us to
account for it!

Jos 22:24 The truth is, we have done this as a precaution: in the future, your descendants might say to ours,
‘What connection do you have with Yahweh, God of Israel?

Jos 22:25 Has not Yahweh set the frontier of the Jordan between us and you, you Reubenites and Gadites?

You have no share in Yahweh’. Thus, your descendants would be the cause of stopping ours from fearing
Yahweh.

Jos 22:26 “So we said to each other, ‘Let us build this altar, not for burnt offerings or other sacrifices
Jos 22:27 but as a witness between us and you and between our descendants after us, attesting that we too
have the right to worship Yahweh, in his presence, with our burnt offerings, our victims and our communion
sacrifices. And so, in the future your descendants will not be able to say to ours: You have no share in Yahweh’.
Jos 22:28 And we furthermore said, ‘If ever it were to happen that they did say this either to us or to our
descendants in the future, we should reply: Look at this structure, Yahweh’s altar, made by our ancestors not for
burnt offerings or other sacrifices but as a witness between us and you’.

Jos 22:29 Far be it from us to rebel against Yahweh or now to repudiate our allegiance to Yahweh by building
an altar for burnt offerings or oblations or sacrifices, in rivalry with the altar of Yahweh our God that stands
before his Dwelling!”.

Jos 22:30 When the priest Phinehas, the leaders of the community and the heads of the clans of Israel who
were with him, heard the words spoken by the Gadites, the Reubenites and the Manassehites, they approved of
them.

Jos 22:31 The priest Phinehas son of Eleazar then said to the Reubenites, the Gadites and the Manassehites,
“Today, we can see that Yahweh is among us, since you have not been unfaithful to Yahweh in this matter; this
means that you have spared the Israelites from Yahweh’s avenging hand”.

Jos 22:32 The priest Phinehas son of Eleazar and the leaders left the Reubenites and the Gadites and went
back from Gilead to Canaan and the Israelites, to whom they reported the answer.

Jos 22:33 The Israelites were pleased to hear this; the Israelites gave thanks to God and spoke no more of
marching against them to make war on them and to ravage the country inhabited by the Reubenites and the
Gadites.

Jos 22:34 The Reubenites and the Gadites called the altar … , “Because”, they said, “it will be a witness
between us that Yahweh is God”.

Jos 23:1 Now long after Yahweh had given Israel rest from all the enemies surrounding them — Joshua was old
now, far advanced in years-

Jos 23:2 Joshua summoned all Israel, their elders, leaders, judges and officials, and said to them, “I myself am
old, far advanced in years;

Jos 23:3 you for your part have witnessed all that Yahweh your God has done to all these nations for your sake;
Yahweh your God himself has fought for you.

Jos 23:4 Look, these nations still remaining, and all the nations which I have exterminated from the Jordan all
the way to the Great Sea in the west, I have allotted to you as the heritage for your tribes.

Jos 23:5 Yahweh your God will himself drive them out before you; he will dispossess them before you and you
will take possession of their country, as Yahweh your God has promised you.

Jos 23:6 “So be very firm about keeping and doing everything written in the Book of the Law of Moses, not
swerving from that either to right or to left.

Jos 23:7 Never mix with the peoples who are still left beside you. Do not utter the names of their gods, do not
swear by them, do not serve them and do not bow down to them.

Jos 23:8 On the contrary, you must be loyal to Yahweh your God as you have been till now.

Jos 23:9 Yahweh has dispossessed great and powerful nations before you, and no one so far has been able to
resist you.

Jos 23:10 One man of you was able to rout a thousand of them, since Yahweh your God was himself fighting for
you, as he had promised you.

Jos 23:1 1 Be very careful, as you value your life, to love Yahweh your God.

Jos 23:12 “But should you in any way relapse, if you make friends with the remnant of these nations still living
beside you, if you intermarry with them, if you mix with them and they with you,

Jos 23:13 then know for certain that Yahweh your God will stop dispossessing these nations before you, and for
you they will be a snare, a pitfall, thorns in your sides and thistles in your eyes, until you vanish from this fine
country given you by Yahweh your God.

Jos 23:14 “Today, you see, I am going the way of all the earth. Acknowledge with all your heart and soul that of
all the promises made to you by Yahweh your God, not one has failed: all have been fulfilled — not one has
failed.

Jos 23:15 “As every promise made to you by Yahweh your God has been fulfilled for you, by the same token



Yahweh will fulfil all his threats against you, even to exterminating you from this fine country given you by
Yahweh your God.

Jos 23:16 “For if you violate the covenant which Yahweh your God has imposed on you, if you go and serve
other gods and bow down to them, then Yahweh’s anger will be roused against you and you will quickly vanish
from the fine country which he has given you”.

Jos 24:1 Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel together at Shechem; he then summoned all the elders of
Israel, its leaders, judges and officials, and they presented themselves in God’s presence.

Jos 24:2 Joshua then said to all the people: “Yahweh, the God of Israel, says this, ‘From time immemorial, your
ancestors, Terah, father of Abraham and Nahor, lived beyond the River, and served other gods.

Jos 24:3 I then brought your ancestor Abraham from beyond the River and led him through the length and
breadth of Canaan. I increased his descendants and I gave him Isaac.

Jos 24:4 To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. To Esau I gave possession of the mountainous country of Seir.

Jacob and his sons went down into Egypt.

Jos 24:5 I then sent Moses and Aaron, and plagued Egypt with the wonders that I worked there; finally I brought
you out.

Jos 24:6 I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, and you came to the Sea; the Egyptians pursued your ancestors
with chariots and horsemen, to the Sea of Reeds.

Jos 24:7 They then called to Yahweh, and he spread a thick fog between you and the Egyptians, and made the
sea go back on them and cover them. You saw with your own eyes what I did in Egypt. Then, for a long while,
you lived in the desert.

Jos 24:8 I then brought you into the country of the Amorites, who used to live on the further side of the Jordan;
they made war on you and I put them at your mercy; after which, you took possession of their country, since I
destroyed them before you.

Jos 24:9 Next, Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, rose to make war on Israel, and sent for Balaam son of Beor
to come and curse you.

Jos 24:10 But I would not listen to Balaam; instead, he had to bless you, and I saved you from his power.

Jos 24:1 1 ‘You then crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho, but the inhabitants of Jericho made war on you:
Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites and Jebusites, and I put them all at your mercy.
Jos 24:12 I sent hornets ahead of you, which drove out the two Amorite kings before you; this was not the work
of your sword or of your bow.

Jos 24:13 And now I have given you a country for which you have not toiled, towns you have not built, although
you live in them, vineyards and olive groves you have not planted, although you eat their fruit’.

Jos 24:14 “So now, fear Yahweh and serve him truly and sincerely; banish the gods whom your ancestors
served beyond the River and in Egypt, and serve Yahweh.

Jos 24:15 But if serving Yahweh seems a bad thing to you, today you must make up your minds whom you do
mean to serve, whether the gods whom your ancestors served beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites in
whose country you are now living. As regards my family and me, we shall serve Yahweh”.

Jos 24:16 The people replied, “Far be it from us to desert Yahweh and to serve other gods!

Jos 24:17 Yahweh our God was the one who brought us and our ancestors here from Egypt, from the place of
slave-labour, who worked those great wonders before our eyes and who kept us safe all along the way we
travelled and among all the peoples through whom we passed.

Jos 24:18 And Yahweh has driven all the nations out for us, including the Amorites who used to live in the
country. We too shall serve Yahweh, for he is our God”.

Jos 24:19 Joshua then said to the people, “You will not be able to serve Yahweh, since he is a holy God, he is a
jealous God who will not tolerate either your misdeeds or your sins.

Jos 24:20 If you desert Yahweh and serve the foreigners’ gods, he will turn and maltreat you anew and, in spite
of having been good to you in the past, will destroy you”.

Jos 24:21 The people replied to Joshua, “No! Yahweh is the one we mean to serve”.

Jos 24:22 Joshua then said to the people, “You are witnesses to yourselves that you have chosen Yahweh, to
serve him”. They replied, “Witnesses we are!”.

Jos 24:23 Then banish the foreign gods which you have with you and give your allegiance to Yahweh, God of
Israel!”.

Jos 24:24 The people replied to Joshua, “Yahweh our God is the one whom we shall serve; his voice we shall
obey!”.

Jos 24:25 That day Joshua made a covenant for the people; he laid down a statute and ordinance for them at
Shechem.

Jos 24:26 Joshua wrote these words in the Book of the Law of God. Fie then took a large stone and set it up
there, under the oak tree in Yahweh’s sanctuary.

Jos 24:27 Joshua then said to all the people, “Look, this stone will be a witness to us, since it has heard all the



words that Yahweh has spoken to us: it will be a witness against you, in case you should deny your God”.

Jos 24:28 Joshua then dismissed the people, every one to his own heritage.

Jos 24:29 After this, Joshua son of Nun, servant of Yahweh, died; he was a hundred and ten years old.

Jos 24:30 He was buried on the estate which he had received as his heritage, at Timnath-Serah which lies in
the highlands of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.

Jos 24:31 Israel served Yahweh throughout the lifetime of Joshua and throughout the lifetime of those elders
who outlived Joshua and had known all the deeds which Yahweh had done for the sake of Israel.

Jos 24:32 As regards the bones of Joseph, which the Israelites had brought from Egypt, these were buried at
Shechem in the plot of ground which Jacob had bought for a hundred pieces of silver from the sons of Hamor
father of Shechem, and which had become the heritage of the sons of Joseph.

Jos 24:33 Eleazar son of Aaron then died and was buried at Gibeah, the town of his son Phinehas, which had
been given to him in the highlands of Ephraim.
