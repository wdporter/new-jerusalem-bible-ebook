<h4>Title (1:1–3)</h4>

<p>The words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, one of the priests living at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin. The word of Yahweh came to him in the days of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign; then in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah son of Josiah, king of Judah, until the deportation of Jerusalem, in the fifth month.</p>

<h2 id="i">I: Prophecies Against Judah and Jerusalem (1:4–25:13)</h2>

<h3 id="ia">A: In the Reign of Josiah (1:4–6:30)</h3>

<h4>The call of Jeremiah (1:4–19)</h4>

<p>The word of Yahweh came to me, saying:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>“Before I formed you in the womb I knew you;</span><br />
		<span>before you came to birth I consecrated you;</span><br />
		<span>I appointed you as prophet to the nations”.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I then said, “Ah, ah, ah, Lord Yahweh; you see, I do not know how to speak: I am only a child!”.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>But Yahweh replied,</span><br />
		<span>“Do not say, ‘I am only a child’,</span><br />
		<span>for you must go to all to whom I send you</span><br />
		<span>and say whatever I command you.</span><br />
		<span>Do not be afraid of confronting them,</span><br />
		<span>for I am with you to rescue you,</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh declares”.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then Yahweh stretched out his hand and touched my mouth, and Yahweh said to me:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>“There! I have put my words into your mouth.</span><br />
		<span>Look, today I have set you</span><br />
		<span>over the nations and kingdoms,</span><br />
		<span>to uproot and to knock down,</span><br />
		<span>to destroy and to overthrow,</span><br />
		<span>to build and to plant”.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The word of Yahweh came to me, asking, “Jeremiah, what do you see?”.</p>

<p>I answered, “I see a branch of the Watchful Tree”.</p>

<p>Then Yahweh said, “Well seen, for I am watching over my word to perform it”.</p>

<p>A second time the word of Yahweh came to me, asking, “What do you see?”.</p>

<p>I answered, “I see a cooking pot on the boil, with its mouth tilting from the north”. Then Yahweh said:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>“From the north disaster will come boiling over</span><br />
		<span>on all who live in the country,</span><br />
		<span>for I am now summoning</span><br />
		<span>all the families of the kingdoms of the north,</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh declares.</span><br />
		<span>They will come, and each will set his throne</span><br />
		<span>in front of the gates of Jerusalem,</span><br />
		<span>all around, against its walls</span><br />
		<span>and against all the towns of Judah.</span><br />
		<span>I shall pronounce my judgements on them</span><br />
		<span>because of all their wickedness,</span><br />
		<span>since they have abandoned me,</span><br />
		<span>offering incense to other gods</span><br />
		<span>and worshipping what their own hands have made.</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>“As for you, prepare yourself for action.</span><br />
		<span>Stand up and tell them</span><br />
		<span>all I command you.</span><br />
		<span>Have no fear of them</span><br />
		<span>and in their presence I will make you fearless.</span><br />
		<span>For look, today I have made you</span><br />
		<span>into a fortified city,</span><br />
		<span>a pillar of iron,</span><br />
		<span>a wall of bronze</span><br />
		<span>to stand against the whole country:</span><br />
		<span>the kings of Judah, its princes,</span><br />
		<span>its priests and the people of the country.</span><br />
		<span>They will fight against you</span><br />
		<span>but will not overcome you,</span><br />
		<span>for I am with you,</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh declares,</span><br />
		<span>to rescue you”.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>The earliest preaching of Jeremiah: the infidelity of Israel (2:1–37)</h4>

<p>The word of Yahweh came to me, saying, “Go and shout this in Jerusalem’s ears:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>“Yahweh says this:</span><br />
		<span>‘I remember your faithful love,</span><br />
		<span>the affection of your bridal days,</span><br />
		<span>when you followed me through the desert,</span><br />
		<span>through a land unsown.</span><br />
		<span>Israel was sacred to Yahweh;</span><br />
		<span>the first-fruits of his harvest;</span><br />
		<span>all who ate this incurred guilt,</span><br />
		<span>disaster befell them,</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh declares’”.</span><br />
		<span>Listen to Yahweh’s word, House of Jacob</span><br />
		<span>and all the families of the House of Israel.</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh says this,</span><br />
		<span>“What did your ancestors find wrong in me</span><br />
		<span>for them to have deserted me so far</span><br />
		<span>as to follow Futility</span><br />
		<span>and become futile themselves?</span><br />
		<span>They never said, ‘Where is Yahweh,</span><br />
		<span>who brought us out of Egypt</span><br />
		<span>and led us through the desert,</span><br />
		<span>through a land of plains and ravines,</span><br />
		<span>through a land of drought, of shadow dark as death,</span><br />
		<span>a land through which no one passes</span><br />
		<span>and where no human being lives?’.</span><br />
		<span>I brought you to a country of plenty,</span><br />
		<span>to enjoy its produce and good things;</span><br />
		<span>but when you entered you defiled my country</span><br />
		<span>and made my heritage loathsome.</span><br />
		<span>The priests never asked, ‘Where is Yahweh?’.</span><br />
		<span>Those skilled in the Law did not know me,</span><br />
		<span>the shepherds too rebelled against me</span><br />
		<span>and the prophets prophesied by Baal</span><br />
		<span>and followed the Useless Ones.</span><br />
		<span>So I must state my case against you once more,</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh declares,</span><br />
		<span>and state my case against your children’s children:</span><br />
		<span>Cross to the isles of the Kittim and look,</span><br />
		<span>send to Kedar and carefully observe,</span><br />
		<span>see if anything like this has happened before!</span><br />
		<span>Does a nation change its gods?</span><br />
		<span>— and these are not gods at all!</span><br />
		<span>Yet my people have exchanged their Glory</span><br />
		<span>for the Useless One!</span><br />
		<span>You heavens, stand aghast at this,</span><br />
		<span>horrified, utterly appalled,</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh declares.</span><br />
		<span>For my people have committed two crimes:</span><br />
		<span>they have abandoned me,</span><br />
		<span>the fountain of living water,</span><br />
		<span>and dug water-tanks for themselves,</span><br />
		<span>cracked water-tanks</span><br />
		<span>that hold no water.</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>“Is Israel a slave?</span><br />
		<span>Was he born into serfdom,</span><br />
		<span>for him to be preyed on like this?</span><br />
		<span>Lions have roared at him,</span><br />
		<span>they have made their voices heard.</span><br />
		<span>They have left this country a desert,</span><br />
		<span>his towns lie burnt and uninhabited.</span><br />
		<span>The people of Noph and Tahpanhes</span><br />
		<span>have shaved your skull!</span><br />
		<span>Have you not brought this on yourself,</span><br />
		<span>by abandoning Yahweh your God,</span><br />
		<span>when he was guiding you on your way?</span><br />
		<span>What is the good of going to Egypt now</span><br />
		<span>to drink the water of the Nile?</span><br />
		<span>What is the good of going to Assyria</span><br />
		<span>to drink the water of the River?</span><br />
		<span>Your wickedness will bring its own punishment,</span><br />
		<span>your infidelities will bring you to book,</span><br />
		<span>so give thought and see</span><br />
		<span>how evil and bitter it is</span><br />
		<span>to abandon Yahweh your God</span><br />
		<span>and not to stand in awe of me,</span><br />
		<span>the Lord Yahweh Sabaoth declares.</span>

	<p class="poem">
		<span>“It is long ago now since you broke your yoke,</span><br />
		<span>burst your bonds</span><br />
		<span>and said, ‘I will not serve!’.</span><br />

		<span>and under every green tree</span><br />
		<span>you have sprawled and played the whore.</span><br />
		<span>Yet I had planted you, a red vine</span><br />
		<span>of completely sound stock.</span><br />
		<span>How is it you have turned into seedlings</span><br />
		<span>of a vine that is alien to me?</span><br />
		<span>Even though you scrub yourself with soda</span><br />

		<span>Look at your behaviour in the Valley,</span><br />

		<span>your own throat grow dry!</span><br />

<h4>The Northern Kingdom urged to repent (3:6–13)</h4>

<p>In the days of King Josiah, Yahweh said to me, “Have you seen what disloyal Israel has done? How she has made her way up every high hill and to every green tree, and played the whore there? I thought, ‘After doing all this she will come back to me’. But she did not come back. Her faithless sister Judah saw this. She also saw that I had repudiated disloyal Israel for all her adulteries and given her her divorce papers. Her faithless sister Judah, however, was not afraid: she too went and played the whore. And with her shameless whoring, she polluted the country; she committed adultery with stones and pieces of wood. Worse than all this: Judah, her faithless sister, has come back to me not in sincerity, but only in pretence, Yahweh declares”.</p>

<p>And Yahweh said to me, “Disloyal Israel is upright, compared with faithless Judah. So go and shout words towards the north, and say:</p> 

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>‘Come back, disloyal Israel,</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh declares,</span><br />
		<span>I shall frown on you no more,</span><br />
		<span>since I am merciful,</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh declares.</span><br />
		<span>I shall not keep my anger for ever.</span><br />
		<span>Only acknowledge your guilt:</span><br />
		<span>how you have rebelled against Yahweh your God,</span><br />
		<span>how you have prostituted yourself with the Strangers</span><br />
		<span>under every green tree</span><br />
		<span>and have not listened to my voice,</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh declares.</span>
	</p>

<h4>Zion in the messianic age (3:14–18)</h4>

<p>‘Come back, disloyal children, Yahweh declares, for I alone am your Master, and I will take you, one from a town, two from a family, and bring you to Zion. I shall give you shepherds after my own heart, who will pasture you wisely and discreetly. Then, when you have increased and grown numerous in the country, Yahweh declares, no one will ever again say: The ark of the covenant of Yahweh! It will not enter their minds, they will not remember it or miss it, nor will another one be made. When that time comes, Jerusalem will be called: The Throne of Yahweh, and all the nations will converge on her, on Yahweh’s name, on Jerusalem, and will no longer follow their own stubborn and wicked inclinations.</p>

<p>‘When those days come, the House of Judah will join the House of Israel; together they will come from the land of the north to the country I gave your ancestors as their heritage’.</p>

<h4>Continuation of the poem of conversion (3:19–4:4)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>“And I was thinking:</span><br />
		<span>How am I to rank you as my children?</span><br />
		<span>I shall give you a country of delights,</span><br />
		<span>the fairest heritage of all the nations!</span><br />
		<span>I thought: You will call me Father</span><br />
		<span>and will never cease to follow me.</span><br />
		<span>But like a woman betraying her lover,</span><br />

		<span>The hills are a delusion after all,</span><br />
		<span>so is the tumult of the mountains.</span><br />

		<span>the saving of Israel.</span><br />
		<span>Shame has devoured what our ancestors worked for</span><br />
		<span>ever since we were young,</span><br />
		<span>their flocks and herds, their sons and their daughters.</span><br />
		<span>Let us lie down in our shame,</span><br />
		<span>let our confusion cover us,</span><br />

		<span>They have set their faces harder than rock,</span><br />
		<span>they have refused to repent.</span><br />

		<span>And so, a lion from the forest will slaughter them,</span><br />
		<span>a wolf from the plains will despoil them,</span><br />
		<span>a leopard will be lurking around their towns:</span><br />

<h4>Lesson to be drawn from the punishment (5:18–19)</h4>

<p>“Yet even in those days, Yahweh declares, I shall not annihilate you completely.</p>

<h3 id="ib">B: Prophecies Mainly in the Reign of Jehoiakim (7:1–20:18)</h3>

<h4>True Worship (7:1–8:3)</h4>

<h5>a: Against the Temple (7:1–15)</h5>

<p>The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, saying, “Stand at the gate of the Temple of Yahweh and there proclaim this message. Say, ‘Listen to the word of Yahweh, all you of Judah who come in by these gates to worship Yahweh. Yahweh Sabaoth, the God of Israel, says this: Amend your behaviour and your actions and I will let you stay in this place. Do not put your faith in delusive words, such as: This is Yahweh’s sanctuary, Yahweh’s sanctuary, Yahweh’s sanctuary! But if you really amend your behaviour and your actions, if you really treat one another fairly, if you do not exploit the stranger, the orphan and the widow, if you do not shed innocent blood in this place and if you do not follow other gods, to your own ruin, then I shall let you stay in this place, in the country I gave for ever to your ancestors of old. Look, you are putting your faith in delusive, worthless words! Steal, would you, murder, commit adultery, perjure yourselves, burn incense to Baal, follow other gods of whom you know nothing? — and then come and stand before me in this Temple that bears my name, saying: Now we are safe to go on doing all these loathsome things! Do you look on this Temple that bears my name as a den of bandits? I, at any rate, can see straight, Yahweh declares.</p>

<p>‘Now go to the place which used to be mine at Shiloh, where I once gave my name a home; see what I have done to it because of the wickedness of my people Israel! And now, since you have done all these things, Yahweh declares, and refused to listen when I spoke so urgently, so persistently, or to answer when I called you, I shall treat this Temple that bears my name, and in which you put your heart, the place that I gave you and your ancestors, just as I treated Shiloh, and I shall drive you out of my sight, as I did all your kinsfolk, the whole race of Ephraim’.</p>

<h5>b: Alien gods (7:16–20)</h5>

<p>“You, for your part, must not intercede for this people, nor raise either plea or prayer on their behalf; do not plead with me, for I will not listen to you. Can you not see what they are doing in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? The children collect the wood, the fathers light the fire, the women knead the dough, to make cakes for the Queen of Heaven; and, to spite me, they pour libations to alien gods. Is it really me they spite, Yahweh demands, is it not in fact themselves, to their own confusion? So, Lord Yahweh says this, ‘My anger, my wrath will be poured down on this place, on man and beast, on the trees of the countryside and the fruits of the soil; it will burn, and not be quenched’.
</p>

<h5>c: Worship without sincerity (7:21–28) </h5>

<p>“Yahweh Sabaoth, the God of Israel, says this, ‘Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices and eat all the meat. For when I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, I said nothing to them, gave them no orders, about burnt offerings or sacrifices. My one command to them was this: Listen to my voice, then I will be your God and you shall be my people. In everything, follow the way that I mark out for you, and you shall prosper. But they did not listen, they did not pay attention; they followed their own devices, their own stubborn and wicked inclinations, and got worse rather than better. From the day your ancestors left Egypt until today, I have sent you all my servants the prophets, persistently sending them day after day. But they have not listened to me, have not paid attention; they have deliberately resisted, behaving worse than their ancestors. So you will tell them all this, but they will not listen to you; you will call them, but they will not answer you’. Then you are to say to them, ‘This is the nation that will neither listen to the voice of Yahweh its God nor take correction. Sincerity is no more, it has vanished from their mouths.</p>

<h5>d: More about idolatrous worship: a threat of exile (7:29–8:3)</h5>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>‘Cut off your tresses, throw them away!</span><br />
		<span>On the bare heights raise a dirge,</span><br />
		<span>for Yahweh has rejected, has abandoned,</span><br />
		<span>a brood that enrages him!’.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Yes, the people of Judah have done what displeases me, Yahweh declares. They have set up their Horrors in the Temple that bears my name, to defile it, and have built the high places of Topheth in the Valley of Ben-Hinnom, to burn their sons and daughters: a thing I never ordered, that had never entered my thoughts. So now the days are coming, Yahweh declares, when people will no longer say Topheth or Valley of Ben-Hinnom, but Valley of Slaughter. Topheth will become a burial ground, for lack of other space; the corpses of this people will be food for the birds of the sky and the animals of earth, and there will be no one to drive them off. I shall silence the shouts of rejoicing and mirth and the voices of bridegroom and bride, in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, for the country will be reduced to desert”.</p>

<p>“When that time comes, Yahweh declares, the bones of the kings of Judah, the bones of its chief men, the bones of the priests, the bones of the prophets and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, will be taken from their tombs. They will be spread out before the sun, the moon, the whole array of heaven, whom they have loved and served, followed, consulted and worshipped. They will not be gathered or reburied but will be left lying on the surface like dung. And death will seem preferable to life to all the survivors of this wicked race, wherever I have driven them, Yahweh Sabaoth declares.</p>



<h4>Threats, laments, advice.<br />
Israel’s perversity (8:4–7)</h4>

<blockquote>

		<span>Why does this people persist in acts of infidelity,</span><br />
		<span>why does Jerusalem persist in continuous infidelity?</span><br />
		<span>They cling to illusion, they refuse to turn back.</span><br />
		<span>I have listened attentively:</span><br />
		<span>they have never said anything like that.</span><br />
		<span>Not one repents of wickedness</span><br />
		<span>saying: What have I done?</span><br />
		<span>Each one keeps returning to the course</span><br />
		<span>like a horse charging into battle.</span><br />
		<span>Even the stork in the sky</span><br />
		<span>knows the appropriate season;</span><br />
		<span>turtledove, swallow and crane</span><br />
		<span>observe their time of migration.</span><br />
		<span>But my people do not know</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh’s laws!’”.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>The Law as administered by the priests (8:8–9)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>How can you say, “We are wise,</span><br />
		<span>since we have Yahweh’s Law?”.</span><br />
		<span>Look how it has been falsified</span><br />
		<span>by the lying pen of the scribes!</span><br />
		<span>The wise are put to shame,</span><br />
		<span>alarmed, caught out</span><br />
		<span>because they have rejected Yahweh’s word.</span><br />
		<span>What price their wisdom now?</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Repetition of an earlier threat (8:10–12)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>So I shall give their wives to other men,</span><br />
		<span>their fields to new masters,</span><br />

<p>Yahweh says, “This is because they have forsaken my Law which I gave them and have not listened to my voice or followed it, but have followed their own stubborn hearts, have followed the Baals as their ancestors taught them”. So Yahweh Sabaoth, the God of Israel, says this, “Now I shall give this people wormwood to eat and poisoned water to drink.

<h4>Jeremiah and observance of the covenant (11:1–14)</h4>

<p>The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, “Hear the terms of this covenant; tell them to the people of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. Tell them, ‘Yahweh, God of Israel, says this: Cursed be anyone who will not listen to the terms of this covenant which I ordained for your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, out of that iron-foundry. Listen to my voice, I told them, carry out all my orders, then you will be my people and I shall be your God, so that I may fulfil the oath I swore to your ancestors, that I may give them a country flowing with milk and honey, as is the case today’”.</p>

<p>I replied, “So be it, Yahweh!”.</p>

<p>Then Yahweh said to me, “Proclaim all these terms in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, ‘Listen to the terms of this covenant and obey them. For when I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, I solemnly warned them, and have persistently warned them until today, saying: Listen to my voice. But they did not listen, did not pay attention; instead, each followed his own stubborn and wicked inclinations. And against them, in consequence, I put into action the words of this covenant which I had ordered them to obey and which they had not obeyed’”.</p>

<p>Yahweh said to me, “Plainly there is conspiracy among the people of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem. They have reverted to the sins of their ancestors who refused to listen to my words: they too are following other gods and serving them. The House of Israel and the House of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their ancestors. And so, Yahweh says this, ‘I shall now bring a disaster on them which they cannot escape; they will call to me for help, but I shall not listen to them. The towns of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem will then go and call for help to the gods to whom they burn incense, but these will be no help at all to them in their time of distress!</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>‘For you have as many gods</span><br />
		<span>as you have towns, Judah!</span><br />

		<span>as Jerusalem has streets!</span>

<h4>Rebuke to the frequenters of the Temple (11:15–17)</h4>

<h4>Jeremiah persecuted at Anathoth (11:18–23)</h4>

<p>Yahweh informed me and I knew it; you then revealed their scheming to me. I for my part was like a trustful lamb being led to the slaughterhouse, not knowing the schemes they were plotting against me, “Let us destroy the tree in its strength, let us cut him off from the land of the living, so that his name may no longer be remembered!”.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Against the people of Anathoth who are determined to kill me and say to me, “Do not prophesy in the name of Yahweh or you will die at our hands!”.</p>

<p>Yahweh says this, “I am about to punish them. Their young people will die by the sword, their sons and daughters by famine. Not one will be left when I bring disaster on the people of Anathoth, when the year for punishing them comes”.</p>

<h4>The prosperity of the wicked (12:1–6)</h4>

		<span>they flourish, yes, and bear fruit.</span><br />

		<span>so I now hate it.</span><br />
		<span>I see my heritage as a brightly-coloured bird of prey</span><br />
		<span>attacked by birds of prey on every side!</span><br />
		<span>Go, assemble all the wild animals,</span><br />
		<span>make them come and dine!</span><br />

		<span>to a deserted wilderness.</span><br />
		<span>They have made it a waste;</span><br />

		<span>Wheat they have sown, thorns they reap:</span><br />

		<span>because of Yahweh’s burning anger.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>The neighbouring peoples: their judgement and salvation (12:14–17)</h4>

<p>Yahweh says this, “As regards all my evil neighbours who have laid hands on the heritage I granted my people Israel, look, I shall uproot them from their soil, (though I shall uproot the House of Judah from among them). But having uprooted them, I shall take pity on them again and bring them back each to its own heritage, each to its own country, and if they carefully learn my people’s ways and swear by my name, ‘As Yahweh lives’, as they have taught my people to swear by Baal, then they will be reëstablished among my people. But if any nation refuses to listen, I shall uproot it for ever and destroy it, Yahweh declares”.</p>

<h4>The useless waistcloth (13:1–11)</h4>

<p>Yahweh said this to me, “Go and buy a linen waistcloth and put it around your waist. But do not dip it in water”. And so, as Yahweh had ordered, I bought a waistcloth and put it around my waist. A second time the word of Yahweh came to me, “Take the waistcloth that you have bought and are wearing around your waist. Up, go to the Euphrates and hide it there in a hole in the rock”. So I went and hid it by the Euphrates as Yahweh had ordered me. A long time later, Yahweh said to me, “Up, go to the Euphrates and fetch the waistcloth I ordered you to hide there”. So I went to the Euphrates, and I searched, and I took the waistcloth from the place where I had hidden it. And there was the waistcloth ruined, no use for anything. Then the word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows, “Yahweh says this, ‘In the same way I shall ruin the pride of Judah, the immense pride of Jerusalem. This evil people, these people who refuse to listen to my words, who follow their own stubborn inclinations and run after other gods, serving and worshipping them — this people will become like this waistcloth, no good for anything. For just as a waistcloth clings to a man’s waist, so I made the whole House of Israel and the whole House of Judah cling to me, Yahweh declares, to be my people, my glory, my honour and my pride. But they have not listened’.

<h4>The wine jugs smashed together (13:12–14)</h4>

<p>“You will also say this to them, ‘Yahweh, God of Israel, says this: Any jug can be filled with wine’. And if they answer you, ‘Do you think we do not know that any jug can be filled with wine?’, you are to say, ‘Yahweh says this: Look, I shall fill all the inhabitants of this country, the kings who occupy the throne of David, the priests, the prophets and all the citizens of Jerusalem, with drunkenness. Then I shall smash them one against the other, parents and children all together, Yahweh declares. Mercilessly, relentlessly, pitilessly, I shall destroy them’”.</p>

<p>Yahweh says this about this people, “They take such pleasure in darting hither and thither, they cannot restrain their feet! But Yahweh takes pleasure in them no longer; now he will keep their guilt in mind and punish their sins”.</p>

<p>Yahweh then said to me, “Do not intercede for this people or their welfare. If they fast, I will not listen to their plea; if they offer burnt offerings and cereal offerings I will not accept them. Rather, I shall make an end of them by sword, famine and plague”.</p>

Delusive visions, hollow predictions, daydreams of their own, that is what they prophesy to you. Therefore, Yahweh says this: The prophets who prophesy in my name when I have not sent them, and tell you there will be no sword or famine in this country, these same prophets will meet their end by sword and famine. And as for the people to whom they prophesy, they will be tossed into the streets of Jerusalem, victims of famine and the sword, with not a soul to bury them: neither them nor their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters. I shall pour their own wickedness down on them.</p>

<h4>The prophet’s life is itself symbolic (16:1–13)</h4>

<p>The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows:</p>

<p>“You are not to marry or have sons and daughters in this place. For Yahweh says this regarding the sons and daughters to be born in this place, about the mothers who give birth to them, and about the fathers who beget them in this land, ‘They will die of deadly diseases, unlamented and unburied; they will be like dung spread on the ground; they will meet their end by sword and famine, and their corpses will be food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of earth’.</p>

<p>“Yes, Yahweh says this, ‘Go into no house where there is mourning, do not go and lament or grieve with them; for I have withdrawn my peace from this people, Yahweh declares, and faithful love and pity too. High or low, they will die in this country, without burial or lament; there will be no gashing, no shaving of the head for them. No bread will be broken for the mourner to comfort him for the dead; no cup of consolation will be offered him for his father or his mother.</p>

<p>‘And do not enter a house where there is feasting, to sit with them and eat and drink. For Yahweh Sabaoth, the God of Israel, says this: In this place, before your eyes, in your own days, I will silence the shouts of rejoicing and mirth and the voices of bridegroom and bride.</p>

<p>‘When you tell these people this and they ask you: Why has Yahweh decreed such complete and total disaster for us? What have we done wrong? What sin have we committed against Yahweh our God?, then you are to answer: It is because your ancestors abandoned me, Yahweh declares, and followed other gods, and served and worshipped them. They abandoned me and did not keep my Law. And you for your part have behaved even worse than your ancestors. Look, each of you follows his own stubborn and wicked inclinations, without listening to me. And so, I shall eject you from this country into a country unknown to you or to your ancestors, and there you can serve other gods, day and night, for I shall show you no more favour’.</p>

<h4>The return of the scattered Israelites (16:14–15)</h4>

<p>“Look, the days are coming, Yahweh declares, when people will no longer say, ‘As Yahweh lives who brought the Israelites out of Egypt!’, but, ‘As Yahweh lives who brought the Israelites back from the land of the north and all the countries to which he had driven them’. I shall bring them back to the very soil I gave their ancestors”.</p>

<h4>The invasion foretold (16:16–18)</h4>

<p>“Watch, I shall send for many fishermen, Yahweh declares, and these will fish them up; next, I shall send for many huntsmen, and these will hunt them out of every mountain, every hill, and out of the holes in the rocks. For my eyes watch all their ways, these are not hidden from me, and their guilt does not escape my gaze. I shall requite their guilt and their sin twice over, since they have polluted my country with the carcases of their Horrors, and filled my heritage with their Abominations”.</p>

<h4>The conversion of the nations (16:19–21)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Yahweh, my strength, my stronghold,</span><br />
		<span>my refuge in time of distress!</span><br />
		<span>To you the nations will come</span><br />
		<span>from the remotest parts of the earth and say,</span><br />
		<span>“Our fathers inherited nothing but Delusion,</span><br />
		<span>Futility of no use whatever.</span><br />
		<span>Can human beings make their own gods?</span><br />
		<span>These are not gods at all!.</span><br />
		<span>Now listen, I will make them acknowledge,</span><br />
		<span>this time I will make them acknowledge</span><br />
		<span>my hand and my might;</span><br />
		<span>and then they will know that Yahweh is my name”.</span>

<h4>Judah’s contaminated worship (17:1–4)</h4>

		<span>engraved with a diamond point</span><br />

		<span>and on the horns of their altars,</span><br />
		<span>while their children remember</span><br />
		<span>their altars and their sacred pole</span><br />
		<span>beside the green trees, on the lofty hills.</span><br />
		<span>My mountain on the plain,</span><br />
		<span>your wealth and all your treasures</span><br />
		<span>I shall hand over to be plundered,</span><br />
		<span>because of the sin of your high places</span><br />
		<span>throughout your territory.</span><br />
		<span>You will have to relinquish your heritage</span><br />
		<span>which I gave you;</span><br />
		<span>I will enslave you to your enemies</span><br />

		<span>and whose heart turns from Yahweh.</span><br />
		<span>Such a person is like scrub in the wastelands:</span><br />
		<span>when good comes, it does not affect him</span><br />

			<span>untroubled in a year of drought,</span><br />

	<p class="poem">
		<span>“The heart is more devious than any other thing,</span><br />

<h4>Observance of the Sabbath (17:19–27)</h4>


<p>Yahweh said this to me, “Go and stand at the Gate of the Sons of the People by which the kings of Judah go in and out — and at all the gates of Jerusalem. Say to them, ‘Listen to the word of Yahweh, you kings of Judah, all you people of Judah too, and all you inhabitants of Jerusalem who pass through the gates. Yahweh says this: As you value your lives, on no account carry a burden on the Sabbath day or bring it in through the gates of Jerusalem. Bring no burden out of your houses on the Sabbath day, and do no work. Keep the Sabbath day holy, as I ordered your ancestors. They would not hear, would not pay attention; they deliberately refused to listen or accept instruction. But if you listen carefully to me, Yahweh declares, and bring no burden in through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day, if you keep the Sabbath holy and do no work on that day, then, through the gates of this city, kings and princes occupying the throne of David will continue to make their entry, riding in chariots or on horseback, they, their chief men, the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And this city will be inhabited for ever. They will come from the towns of Judah, from the districts around Jerusalem, from the territory of Benjamin, from the lowlands, from the highlands, from the Negeb, to offer burnt offering and sacrifice, and cereal offering and incense, to offer thanksgiving sacrifices in the Temple of Yahweh. But if you do not listen to me to keep the Sabbath day holy, and to refrain from entering the gates of Jerusalem with burdens on the Sabbath day, then I shall set fire to its gates; fire will devour the palaces of Jerusalem and not be quenched’”.</p>

<h4>Jeremiah visits the potter (18:1–12)</h4>

<p>The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh as follows, “Get up and make your way down to the potter’s house, and there I shall tell you what I have to say”. So I went down to the potter’s house; and there he was, working at the wheel. But the vessel he was making came out wrong, as may happen with clay when a potter is at work. So he began again and shaped it into another vessel, as he thought fit. Then the word of Yahweh came to me as follows, “House of Israel, can I not do to you what this potter does? Yahweh demands. Yes, like clay in the potter’s hand, so you are in mine, House of Israel. Sometimes I announce that I shall uproot, break down and destroy a certain nation or kingdom, but should the nation I have threatened abandon its wickedness, I then change my mind about the disaster which I had intended to inflict on it. Sometimes I announce that I shall build up and plant a certain nation or kingdom, but should that nation do what displeases me and refuse to listen to my voice, I then change my mind about the good which I was intending to confer on it. So now, say this to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, ‘Yahweh says this: Listen, I am preparing a disaster for you, I am working out a plan against you. So now, each one of you, turn back from your evil ways, amend your conduct and actions’. They, however, will say, ‘It is no use! We shall follow our own plans; each of us will act on his own wicked inclinations’”.</p>

	<blockquote>

			<span>if anyone has heard anything like this.</span><br />

			<span>has done a very horrible thing.</span><br />
			<span>Does the snow of Lebanon</span><br />
			<span>ever leave the rocks of its slopes?</span><br />

	<h4>The broken jug and the altercation with Pashhur (19:1–20:6)</h4>
	
	<p>Then Yahweh said to Jeremiah, “Go and buy a potter’s earthenware jug. Take some of the people’s elders and some of the senior priests with you. Go out towards the Valley of Ben-Hinnom, just outside the Gate of the Potsherds. There proclaim the words I shall say to you. You must say, ‘Kings of Judah, inhabitants of Jerusalem! Listen to the word of Yahweh! Yahweh Sabaoth, the God of Israel, says this: I am about to bring such a disaster on this place that the ears of every one who hears of it will ring. For they have abandoned me and have made this place unrecognisable, and offered incense here to other gods which neither they nor their ancestors nor the kings of Judah ever knew before. They have filled this place with the blood of the innocent; for they have built high places for Baal to burn their sons as burnt offerings to Baal, a thing I never ordered, never mentioned, that had never entered my thoughts. So now the days are coming, Yahweh declares, when people will no longer call this place Topheth, or Valley of Ben-Hinnom, but Valley of Slaughter. Because of this place, I shall empty Judah and Jerusalem of sound advice; I shall make them fall by the sword before their enemies, by the hand of those determined to kill them; I shall give their corpses as food to the birds of the sky and the animals of earth. And I shall make this city an object of horror and derision; every passer-by will be appalled at it and whistle at the sight of all the wounds it has sustained. I shall make them eat the flesh of their own sons and daughters: they will eat one another during the siege, in the shortage to which their enemies, and those determined to kill them, will reduce them’.</p>
	
	<p>“You must break this jug in front of the men who are with you, and say to them, ‘Yahweh Sabaoth says this: I am going to break this people and this city just as one breaks a potter’s pot, so that it can never be mended again.</p>
	
	<p>‘Topheth will become a burial ground, for lack of other burial space. That is how I shall treat this place, Yahweh declares, and its inhabitants, by making this city like Topheth. The houses of Jerusalem and those of the kings of Judah, all the houses on the roofs of which they offered incense to the whole array of heaven and poured libations to other gods, will be unclean, like this place Topheth’”.</p>
	
	<p>Jeremiah then came back from Topheth where Yahweh had sent him to prophesy, and stood in the court of the Temple of Yahweh and said to all the people, “Yahweh Sabaoth, the God of Israel, says this, ‘Yes, on this city, and on all the towns belonging to it, I shall bring all the disaster which I had decreed for it, since they have stubbornly refused to listen to my words’”.</p>
	
	<p>Now the priest Pashhur son of Immer, who was the chief of police in the Temple of Yahweh, heard Jeremiah making this prophecy. Pashhur struck the prophet Jeremiah and then put him in the stocks, in the Upper Benjamin Gate leading into the Temple of Yahweh. Next day, Pashhur had Jeremiah taken out of the stocks; Jeremiah then said to him, “Not Pashhur but Terror-on-every-Side is Yahweh’s name for you. For Yahweh says this, ‘I am going to hand you over to terror, you and all your friends; they will fall by the sword of their enemies, your own eyes will see it. The whole of Judah, too, I shall hand over to the king of Babylon; he will carry them off captive to Babylon and put them to the sword. And all the wealth of this city, all its stores, all its valuables, all the treasures of the kings of Judah, I shall hand over to their enemies who will plunder them, round them up and carry them off to Babylon. As for you, Pashhur, and your whole household, you will go into captivity; you will go to Babylon; there you will die, and there be buried, you and all your friends to whom you have prophesied lies’.</p>

		<span>I would say to myself, “I will not think about him,</span><br />

<h3 id="ic">C: Prophecies Mainly Later than the Reign of Jehoiakim (21:1–24:10)</h3>

<h4>Jeremiah answers the envoys of Zedekiah (21:–10)</h4>

<p>The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh when King Zedekiah sent Pashhur son of Malchiah to him, with the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah, to say this, “Please consult Yahweh for us, since Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is making war on us: perhaps Yahweh will work one of his many miracles for us and force him to withdraw”. Jeremiah said to them, “Take this answer to Zedekiah, ‘Yahweh, God of Israel, says this: I shall bring back the weapons of war which you are now carrying, and with which you are fighting the king of Babylon and the Chaldaeans now besieging you; from outside the walls, I shall stack them in the centre of this city. And I shall fight against you myself with outstretched hand and mighty arm, in anger, fury and great wrath. I shall strike down the inhabitants of this city, human and animal; they will die of a great plague. Then, Yahweh declares, I shall deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, his officials, the people and those of this city who have escaped the plague, the sword, or the famine, into the clutches of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, into the clutches of their enemies and into the clutches of those determined to kill them; mercilessly, relentlessly, pitilessly, he will put them to the sword’.</p>

<p>“And you must say to this people, ‘Yahweh says this: Look, I offer you a choice between the way of life and the way of death. Anyone who stays in this city will die by sword, by famine, or by plague; but anyone who leaves it and surrenders to the Chaldaeans now besieging you will live; he will escape with his life. For I am determined on disaster, and not prosperity, for this city, Yahweh declares. It will be handed over to the king of Babylon, and he will burn it down’”.</p>

<h4>Address to the royal family of Judah (21:11–22:9)</h4>

<p>To the royal House of Judah. Listen to the word of Yahweh, House of David! Yahweh says this:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Each morning give fair judgement,</span><br />
		<span>rescue anyone who has been wronged</span><br />
		<span>from the hands of his oppressor,</span><br />
		<span>or else my wrath will leap out like a fire,</span><br />
		<span>it will burn and no one will be able to quench it,</span><br />
		<span>because of the wickedness of your actions.</span><br />
		<span>My quarrel is with you, resident of the valley,</span><br />
		<span>Rock-in-the-Plain,</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh declares,</span><br />
		<span>with you that say, “Who would dare attack us and enter our lairs?”.</span><br />
		<span>I shall punish you as your actions deserve,</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh declares,</span><br />
		<span>I shall set fire to its forest</span><br />
		<span>and it will devour all around it.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yahweh said this, “Go down to the palace of the king of Judah and there say this word, ‘Listen to the word of Yahweh, king of Judah now occupying the throne of David, you, your officials and your people who go through these gates. Yahweh says this: Act uprightly and justly; rescue from the hands of the oppressor anyone who has been wronged, do not exploit or ill-treat the stranger, the orphan, the widow; shed no innocent blood in this place. For if you are scrupulous in obeying this command, then kings occupying the throne of David will continue to make their entry through the gates of this palace riding in chariots or on horseback, they, their officials and their people. But if you do not listen to these words, then I swear by myself, Yahweh declares, this palace shall become a ruin!</p>

<p>‘Yes, this is what Yahweh says about the palace of the king of Judah:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>You are like Gilead to me,</span><br />
		<span>like a peak of Lebanon.</span><br />
		<span>All the same, I will reduce you to a desert,</span><br />
		<span>to uninhabited towns.</span><br />
		<span>I dedicate men to destroy you,</span><br />
		<span>each man with his weapons;</span><br />
		<span>they will cut down your finest cedars</span><br />
		<span>and throw them on the fire.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>‘And when many nations pass this city, they will say to one another: Why has Yahweh treated this great city like this? And the answer will be: Because they abandoned the covenant of Yahweh their God to worship other gods and serve them’”.</p>

<h4>Prophecies against various kings: against Jehoahaz (22:10–12)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Do not weep for the man who is dead,</span><br />
		<span>do not raise the dirge for him.</span><br />
		<span>Weep rather for the one who has gone away,</span><br />
		<span>since he will never come back,</span><br />
		<span>never see his native land again.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For this is what Yahweh has said about Shallum son of Josiah, king of Judah, who succeeded Josiah his father and was forced to leave this place, “He will never come back to it but will die in the place to which he has been taken captive; and he will never see this country again.</p>

<h4>Against Jehoiakim (22:13–19)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>“Disaster for the man who builds his house without uprightness,</span><br />
		<span>his upstairs rooms without fair judgement,</span><br />
		<span>who makes his fellow-man work for nothing,</span><br />
		<span>without paying him his wages,</span><br />
		<span>who says, ‘I shall build myself a spacious palace</span><br />
		<span>with airy upstairs rooms’,</span><br />
		<span>who makes windows in it,</span><br />
		<span>panels it with cedar, and paints it vermilion.</span><br />
		<span>Are you more of a king</span><br />
		<span>because of your passion for cedar?</span><br />
		<span>Did your father go hungry or thirsty?</span><br />
		<span>But he did what is just and upright,</span><br />
		<span>so all went well for him.</span><br />
		<span>He used to examine the cases of poor and needy,</span><br />
		<span>then all went well.</span><br />
		<span>Is not that what it means to know me? Yahweh demands.</span><br />
		<span>You on the other hand have eyes and heart</span><br />
		<span>for nothing but your own interests,</span><br />
		<span>for shedding innocent blood</span><br />
		<span>and perpetrating violence and oppression”.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is why Yahweh says this about Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah:</p> 

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>“No lamenting for him,</span><br />
		<span>‘My poor brother! My poor sister!’.</span><br />
		<span>No lamenting for him,</span><br />
		<span>‘His poor lordship! His poor majesty!’.</span><br />
		<span>He will have a donkey’s funeral</span><br />
		<span>— dragged away and thrown</span><br />
		<span>out of the gates of Jerusalem”.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Against Jehoiachin (22:20–30)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>“Climb the Lebanon range and shriek,</span><br />
		<span>raise your voice in Bashan,</span><br />
		<span>shriek from the Abarim,</span><br />
		<span>for all your lovers have been ruined!</span><br />
		<span>I spoke to you in your prosperity,</span><br />
		<span>but you said, ‘I will not listen!’.</span><br />
		<span>From your youth this has been how you behaved,</span><br />
		<span>refusing to listen to my voice.</span><br />
		<span>The wind will shepherd all your shepherds away</span><br />
		<span>and your lovers will go into captivity.</span><br />
		<span>Then you will blush deep with shame</span><br />
		<span>at the thought of all your wickedness.</span><br />
		<span>You who have made the Lebanon your home</span><br />
		<span>and made your nest among the cedars,</span><br />
		<span>how you will groan when anguish overtakes you,</span><br />
		<span>pangs like those of a woman in labour!</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>


<p>“As I live, Yahweh declares, even if Coniah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were the signet ring on my right hand, I would still wrench you off! I shall hand you over to those determined to kill you, to those you dread, to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, to the Chaldaeans. I shall hurl you and the mother who bore you into another country; you were not born there but you will both die there. They will not return to the country to which they desperately long to return”.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Is he a shoddy broken pot,</span><br />
		<span>this man Coniah,</span><br />
		<span>a crock that no one wants?</span><br />
		<span>Why are he and his offspring ejected,</span><br />
		<span>hurled into a country</span><br />
		<span>they know nothing of?</span><br />
		<span>O land, land, land,</span><br />
		<span>listen to the word of Yahweh!</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh says this,</span><br />
		<span>“List this man as: Childless;</span><br />
		<span>a man who made a failure of his life,</span><br />
		<span>since none of his offspring will succeed</span><br />
		<span>in occupying the throne of David,</span><br />
		<span>or ruling in Judah again”.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Messianic prophecies. The future king (23:1–8)</h4>

<p>“Disaster for the shepherds who lose and scatter the sheep of my pasture, Yahweh declares. This, therefore, is what Yahweh, God of Israel, says about the shepherds who shepherd my people, ‘You have scattered my flock, you have driven them away and have not taken care of them. Right, I shall take care of you for your misdeeds, Yahweh declares! But the remnant of my flock I myself shall gather from all the countries where I have driven them, and bring them back to their folds; they will be fruitful and increase in numbers. For them I shall raise up shepherds to shepherd them and pasture them. No fear, no terror for them any more; not one shall be lost, Yahweh declares!</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Look, the days are coming, Yahweh declares,</span><br />
		<span>when I shall raise an upright Branch for David;</span><br />
		<span>he will reign as king and be wise,</span><br />
		<span>doing what is just and upright in the country.</span><br />
		<span>In his days Judah will triumph</span><br />
		<span>and Israel live in safety.</span><br />
		<span>And this is the name he will be called,</span><br />
		<span>“Yahweh-is-our-Saving-Justice”’.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“So, look, the days are coming, Yahweh declares, when people will no longer say, ‘As Yahweh lives who brought the Israelites out of Egypt’, but, ‘As Yahweh lives who led back and brought home the offspring of the House of Israel from the land of the north and all the countries to which he had driven them, to live on their own soil’”.</p>

<h4>A tract against the false prophets (23:9–40)</h4>

<p>On the prophets.</p> 

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>My heart is broken within me,</span><br />
		<span>I tremble in all my bones;</span><br />
		<span>I am like a drunken man,</span><br />
		<span>like a man overcome with wine,</span><br />
		<span>because of Yahweh and his holy words:</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>“For the country is full of adulterers;</span><br />
		<span>yes, because of a curse, the country is in mourning</span><br />
		<span>and the pasturage in the desert has dried up;</span><br />
		<span>they are prompt to do wrong,</span><br />
		<span>make no effort to do right.</span><br />
		<span>Yes, even prophet and priest are godless,</span><br />
		<span>I have detected their wickedness in my own House,</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh declares.</span><br />
		<span>Because of this, their way will prove</span><br />
		<span>treacherous going for them;</span><br />
		<span>in the darkness where they are driven,</span><br />
		<span>there they will fall.</span><br />
		<span>For I shall bring disaster on them,</span><br />
		<span>when the year for punishing them comes,</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh declares.</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>“In the prophets of Samaria</span><br />
		<span>I have seen insanity:</span><br />
		<span>they prophesied in the name of Baal</span><br />
		<span>and led my people Israel astray.</span><br />
		<span>But in the prophets of Jerusalem</span><br />
		<span>I have seen something horrible:</span><br />
		<span>adultery, persistent lying,</span><br />
		<span>such abetting of the wicked</span><br />
		<span>that no one renounces his wickedness.</span><br />
		<span>To me they are all like Sodom</span><br />
		<span>and its inhabitants are like Gomorrah.</span><br />
		<span>So this is what Yahweh Sabaoth says about the prophets,</span><br />
		<span>‘Now I shall give them wormwood to eat</span><br />
		<span>and make them drink poisoned water,</span><br />
		<span>since from the prophets of Jerusalem</span><br />
		<span>godlessness has spread throughout the land’.</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>“Yahweh Sabaoth says this,</span><br />
		<span>‘Do not listen to what those prophets prophesy to you;</span><br />
		<span>they are deluding you,</span><br />
		<span>they retail visions of their own,</span><br />
		<span>and not what comes from Yahweh’s mouth.</span><br />
		<span>To those who despise me, they keep saying:</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh has spoken: you will have peace!</span><br />

<p>But who has been present in Yahweh’s council and seen, and heard his word? Who has paid attention to his word and listened to it?</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Look, Yahweh’s hurricane, his wrath, bursts out,</span><br />
		<span>a fearsome hurricane,</span><br />

		<span>until he has performed, has carried out,</span><br />
		<span>what he has in mind.</span><br />
		<span>In the final days, you will understand this clearly,</span><br />
		<span>“I did not send these prophets,</span><br />
		<span>yet they ran!</span><br />
		<span>I did not speak to them,</span><br />
		<span>yet they prophesied!</span><br />
		<span>Had they been present in my council,</span><br />

</blockquote>

<p>“I have heard what the prophets say who make their lying prophecies in my name. ‘I have had a dream’, they say, ‘I have had a dream!’. How long are there to be those among the prophets who prophesy lies and are in fact prophets of their own delusions? They are doing their best, by means of the dreams that they keep telling each other, to make my people forget my name, just as their ancestors forgot my name in favour of Baal. Let the prophet who has had a dream tell it for a dream! And let him who receives a word from me, deliver my word accurately!</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>“What have straw and wheat in common?</span><br />

		<span>is it not like a hammer shattering a rock?</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“So, then, I have a quarrel with the prophets, Yahweh declares, that steal my words from one another. I have a quarrel with the prophets, Yahweh declares, who wag their tongues to utter prophecies. I have a quarrel with the prophets who make prophecies out of lying dreams, Yahweh declares, who recount them, and lead my people astray by their lies and their bragging. I certainly never sent them or commissioned them, and they serve no good purpose for this people, Yahweh declares.</p>

<p>“And when this people, or a prophet, or a priest, asks you, ‘What is Yahweh’s burden?’, you must answer, ‘You are the burden, and I shall get rid of you, Yahweh declares!’.</p>

<p>“As for the prophet, the priest, or anyone else, who says, ‘Yahweh’s burden’, I shall punish that man, and his household too. This is what you must say to one another, among yourselves, ‘What answer has Yahweh given?’, or ‘What has Yahweh said?’. But stop using the expression ‘Yahweh’s burden’, for what each man says will be his own responsibility. And you twist the words of the living God, of Yahweh Sabaoth, our God. This is the way to speak to a prophet, ‘What answer has Yahweh given?’, or ‘What has Yahweh said?’. But if you say, ‘Yahweh’s burden’, then Yahweh says this, ‘Since you use the expression “Yahweh’s burden”, when I have warned you to stop saying, “Yahweh’s burden”, believe me, I shall pick you up and fling you from my presence, you and the city I gave to you and to your ancestors. I shall bring down everlasting shame on you, everlasting and unforgettable disgrace’”.</p>

<h4>The two baskets of figs (24:1–10)</h4>

<p>Yahweh gave me a vision: set out in front of the Temple of Yahweh were two baskets of figs. This was after Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had led Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, away into exile from Jerusalem, with the chief men of Judah, the blacksmiths and metalworkers, and had taken them to Babylon. One basket contained excellent figs, like those that ripen first; the other contained very bad figs, so bad they were uneatable. Yahweh said to me, “What do you see, Jeremiah?”.</p>

<p>“Figs”, I answered, “the good ones excellent, the bad ones very bad, so bad as to be uneatable”.</p>

<p>Then the word of Yahweh was addressed to me, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, says this, ‘As these figs are good, so I mean to concern myself with the welfare of the exiles of Judah whom I have sent from this place to the country of the Chaldaeans. My eyes will watch over them for their good, to bring them back to this country, to build them up and not to break them down, to plant them and not to uproot them. I shall give them a heart to acknowledge that I am Yahweh. They will be my people and I shall be their God, for they will return to me with all their heart. As for the bad figs, the figs so bad as to be uneatable-yes, Yahweh says this — that is how I shall treat Zedekiah king of Judah, his chief men and what is left of Jerusalem, those who remain in this country and those living in Egypt. I shall make them an object of horror, a disaster, to all the kingdoms of the earth, a thing of shame, a byword, a laughing-stock, a curse, wherever I shall drive them. Sword, famine and plague I shall send against them until they have vanished from the soil I gave to them and to their ancestors’”.</p>

<p>The word that was addressed to Jeremiah about all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah (that is to say the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon). The prophet Jeremiah proclaimed it before all the people of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem:</p>

<p>“For twenty-three years, from the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah, until today, the word of Yahweh has been addressed to me and I have never tired of speaking to you (but you have not listened. Furthermore, Yahweh has untiringly sent you all his servants the prophets, but you have not listened or paid attention). The message was this, ‘Turn back, each one of you, from your evil behaviour and your evil actions, and you will go on living on the soil Yahweh long ago gave to you and your ancestors for ever. (And do not follow other gods to serve and worship them, do not provoke me with things you yourselves have made, and then I shall not harm you.) But you have not listened to me (Yahweh declares, so that you have now provoked me with things you yourselves have made, and thus harmed yourselves)’.</p>

<p>“So-this is what Yahweh Sabaoth says, ‘Since you have not listened to my words, I shall now send for all the families of the north (Yahweh declares, that is, for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, my servant) and bring them down on this country and its inhabitants (and on all these surrounding nations); I shall curse them with utter destruction and make them an object of horror, of scorn, and ruin them for ever. From them I shall banish the shouts of rejoicing and mirth, the voices of bridegroom and bride, the sound of the handmill and the light of the lamp; and this whole country will be reduced to ruin and desolation, and these nations will be enslaved to the king of Babylon for seventy years. (But when the seventy years are over, I shall punish the king of Babylon and that nation, Yahweh declares, for the wrong they have done, that is, the country of the Chaldaeans, and make it desolate for ever), and against that country I shall perform all the words with which I have threatened it, that is, everything written in this book’”.</p>

<h2 id="ii">II: Introduction to the Prophecies Against the Nations (25:14–38)</h2>

<h4>The vision of the cup (25:14–38)</h4>

<p>What Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations. (“For these in their turn are to be enslaved to powerful nations and great kings, and I shall pay them back as their deeds and handiwork deserve”.)</p>

<p>For Yahweh, the God of Israel, said this to me, “Take this cup of the wine of wrath and make all the nations to whom I send you drink it; they will drink and reel and lose their wits, because of the sword I am sending among them”. I took the cup from Yahweh’s hand and made all the nations to whom Yahweh sent me drink it (Jerusalem and the towns of Judah, its kings and its chief men, to make them a ruin, an object of horror and derision and a curse, as is the case today): Pharaoh king of Egypt, his officials, his chief men and all his people, with the whole conglomeration of peoples there (all the kings of the country of Uz); all the kings of the country of the Philistines, Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron and what is still left of Ashdod; Edom, Moab and the Ammonites; (all) the kings of Tyre, (all) the kings of Sidon, the kings of the island across the sea; Dedan, Tema, Buz, all the people with shaven temples; all the kings of Arabia (and all the kings of the conglomeration of peoples) who live in the desert (all the kings of Zimri), all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media; all the kings of the north, near and far, one after another: in short, all the kingdoms on the face of the earth. (As for the king of Sheshak, he will drink last of all.)</p>

<p>“You will say to them, ‘Yahweh Sabaoth, the God of Israel, says this: Drink! Get drunk! Vomit! Fall, never to rise again, before the sword that I am sending among you!’. If they refuse to take the cup from your hand and drink, you will say to them, ‘Yahweh Sabaoth says this: You must drink! Look, for a start, I am bringing disaster on the city that bears my name, so are you likely to go unpunished? You certainly will not go unpunished, for next I shall summon a sword against all the inhabitants of the land, Yahweh declares’.
</p>



<p>“For your part, you are to prophesy all these words to them. Say to them:</p>

<h2 id="iii">III: Prophecies of Happiness (26:1–35:19)</h2>

<h3 id="iiia">A: Introduction: Jeremiah the True Prophet (26:1–24)</h3>

<h4>Arrest and trial of Jeremiah (26:1–24)</h4>

<p>At the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, “Yahweh says this, ‘Stand in the court of the Temple of Yahweh. To all the people from the towns of Judah who come to worship in the Temple of Yahweh you will say everything I have ordered you to say, not omitting one syllable. Perhaps they will listen and each turn from his evil way: if so, I shall relent and not bring the disaster on them which I intend because of their misdeeds’. Say to them, ‘Yahweh says this: If you will not listen to me and follow my Law which I have given you, and pay attention to the words of my servants the prophets whom I have never tired of sending to you, although you never have paid attention, I shall treat this Temple as I treated Shiloh, and make this city a curse for all the nations of the world’”.</p>

<p>The priests and prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah say these words in the Temple of Yahweh. When Jeremiah had finished saying everything that Yahweh had ordered him to say to all the people, the priests and prophets and all the people seized hold of him and said, “You will die for this! Why have you made this prophecy in Yahweh’s name, ‘This Temple will become like Shiloh, and this city become an uninhabited ruin’?”. And the people all crowded in on Jeremiah in the Temple of Yahweh. Hearing of this, the chief men of Judah came up from the royal palace to the Temple of Yahweh and took their seats at the entry of the New Gate of the Temple of Yahweh.</p>

<p>The priests and prophets then said to the chief men and all the people, “This man deserves to die, since he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your own ears”.</p>

<p>Jeremiah, however, replied to all the chief men and all the people as follows, “Yahweh himself sent me to prophesy against this Temple and this city all the things you have heard. So now amend your behaviour and actions, listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, and Yahweh will relent about the disaster that he has decreed for you. For myself, I am, as you see, in your hands. Do whatever you please or think right with me. But be sure of this, that if you put me to death, you will be bringing innocent blood on yourselves, on this city and on its inhabitants, since Yahweh has truly sent me to you to say all this for you to hear”.</p>

<p>The chief men and all the people then said to the priests and prophets, “This man does not deserve to die: he has spoken to us in the name of Yahweh our God”. And some of the country’s elders rose to address all the assembled people.</p>
	
<p>“Micah of Moresheth”, they said, “who prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, had this to say to all the people of Judah, ‘Yahweh Sabaoth says this:</p> 

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Zion will become ploughland,</span><br />
		<span>Jerusalem a heap of rubble</span><br />
		<span>and the Temple Mount a wooded height’.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death for this? Did they not rather, fearing Yahweh, plead with him, to such effect that Yahweh relented about the disaster which he had decreed for them? Are we now to burden our souls with such a crime?”.</p>

<p>There was another man, too, who used to prophesy in Yahweh’s name, Uriah son of Shemaiah, from Kiriath-Jearim. He prophesied exactly the same things against this city and this country as Jeremiah. When King Jehoiakim with all his officers and all the chief men heard what he said, the king was determined to put him to death. On hearing this, Uriah took fright and, fleeing, escaped to Egypt. King Jehoiakim, however, sent Elnathan son of Achbor to Egypt with others, who brought Uriah back from Egypt and took him to King Jehoiakim, who had him put to the sword and his body thrown into the common burial ground. But Jeremiah had a protector in Ahikam son of Shaphan, so he was not handed over to the people to be put to death.</p>

<h3 id="iiib">B: The Pamphlet for the Exiles (27:1–29:32)</h3>

<h4>The symbolic yoke and the message to the neighbouring kings (27:1–22)</h4>

<p>(At the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh:) Yahweh said this to me, “Make yourself thongs and yokes and put them on your neck. Then send them to the king of Edom, the king of Moab, the king of the Ammonites, the king of Tyre, and the king of Sidon, through their envoys accredited to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem. Give them the following message for their masters, ‘Yahweh Sabaoth, God of Israel, says this: You must tell your masters this: I by my great power and outstretched arm made the earth, the human beings and the animals that are on earth, and I give them to whom I please. For the present, I have handed all these countries over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, my servant; I have even put the wild animals at his service. (All the nations will serve him, his son and his grandson, until the time for his own country comes in its turn, when mighty nations and great kings will enslave him.) Any nation or kingdom that will not serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and will not bow its neck to the yoke of the king of Babylon, I shall punish that nation with sword, famine and plague, Yahweh declares, until I have destroyed it by his hand. For your own part, do not listen to your prophets, your diviners, dreamers, magicians and sorcerers, who tell you: You will not be enslaved by the king of Babylon. They prophesy lies to you, the result of which will be that you will be banished from your soil, that I shall drive you out, and you will perish. The nation, however, that is prepared to bend its neck to the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I shall leave in peace on its own soil, Yahweh declares, to farm it and stay on it’”.</p>

<p>To Zedekiah king of Judah I spoke in exactly the same terms. “Bend your necks”, I told him, “to the yoke of the king of Babylon; serve him and his people and you will survive. (Why so anxious to die, you and your people, by sword, famine and plague, with which Yahweh has threatened the nation refusing to serve the king of Babylon?) Do not listen to the words the prophets say to you, ‘You will not be enslaved by the king of Babylon’. They prophesy lies to you. Since I have not sent them, Yahweh declares, they prophesy untruths to you in my name. The result will be that I shall drive you out, you will perish, and so will the prophets who prophesy to you”.</p>

<p>I also spoke to the priests and to all this people as follows, “Yahweh says this, ‘Do not listen to the words of your prophets who prophesy to you as follows: Look, the vessels of the Temple of Yahweh will very shortly be brought back from Babylon. They prophesy lies to you. (Do not listen to them; serve the king of Babylon and you will survive. Why should this city become a ruin?) If they are real prophets, if Yahweh’s word is really with them, they ought now to be pleading with Yahweh Sabaoth that the remaining vessels in the Temple of Yahweh, in the palace of the king of Judah and elsewhere in Jerusalem, do not go to Babylon too! For this is what Yahweh Sabaoth says about (the pillars, the Sea, the stands and) the other vessels still remaining in this city, those not carried off by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon when he took Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon (with all the leading men of Judah and Jerusalem). Yes, this is what Yahweh Sabaoth, God of Israel, says about the vessels still remaining in the Temple of Yahweh, in the palace of the king of Judah and elsewhere in Jerusalem: They will be carried off to Babylon (and stay there until the day I punish them), Yahweh declares. (Then I shall bring them back and restore them to this place.)’”</p>

<h4>The dispute with Hananiah (28:1–17)</h4>

<p>That same year, at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fifth month of the fourth year, the prophet Hananiah son of Azzur, a Gibeonite, spoke as follows to Jeremiah in the Temple of Yahweh in the presence of the priests and of all the people, “Yahweh Sabaoth, the God of Israel, says this, ‘I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. In exactly two years’ time I shall bring back all the vessels of the Temple of Yahweh which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from here and carried off to Babylon. And I shall also bring back Jeconiah son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah and all the exiles of Judah who have gone to Babylon, Yahweh declares, for I shall break the yoke of the king of Babylon’”.</p>

<p>The prophet Jeremiah then replied to the prophet Hananiah in front of the priests and all the people present in the Temple of Yahweh. “So be it!”, the prophet Jeremiah said, “May Yahweh do so! May he fulfil the words that you have prophesied and bring all the vessels of the Temple of Yahweh and all the exiles back to this place from Babylon. Listen carefully, however, to this word that I am now going to say for you and all the people to hear: From remote times, the prophets who preceded you and me prophesied war, disaster and plague for many countries and for great kingdoms; the prophet who prophesies peace can be recognised as one truly sent by Yahweh only when his word comes true”.</p>

<p>The prophet Hananiah then snatched the yoke off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah and broke it. In front of all the people Hananiah then said, “Yahweh says this, ‘This is how, in exactly two years’ time, I shall break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and take it off the necks of all the nations’”. At this, the prophet Jeremiah went away.</p>

<p>After the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke he had snatched off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck, the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, “Go to Hananiah and tell him this, ‘Yahweh says this: You have broken the wooden yokes only to make iron yokes to replace them! For Yahweh Sabaoth, the God of Israel, says this: An iron yoke is what I now lay on the necks of all these nations to enslave them to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. (They will be enslaved to him; I have even given him the wild animals.)’”</p>

<p>The prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah, “Listen carefully, Hananiah: Yahweh has not sent you; and thanks to you this people is now relying on what is false. And so, Yahweh says this, ‘I am going to send you off the face of the earth: you will die this year (since you have preached rebellion against Yahweh)’”.</p>

<p>The prophet Hananiah died the same year, in the seventh month.</p>

<h4>The letter to the exiles (29:1–23)</h4>

<p>This is the text of the letter that the prophet Jeremiah sent from Jerusalem to those who were left of the elders in exile, to the priests, the prophets and all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had deported from Jerusalem to Babylon. This was after King Jeconiah had left Jerusalem with the queen mother, the eunuchs, the chief men of Judah and Jerusalem, and the blacksmiths and metalworkers. The letter was entrusted to Elasah son of Shaphan and to Gemariah son of Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah had sent to Babylon, to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. The letter said:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>“Yahweh Sabaoth, the God of Israel, says this to all the exiles deported from Jerusalem to Babylon: Build houses, settle down; plant gardens and eat what they produce; marry and have sons and daughters; choose wives for your sons, find husbands for your daughters so that these can bear sons and daughters in their turn; you must increase there and not decrease. Work for the good of the city to which I have exiled you; pray to Yahweh on its behalf, since on its welfare yours depends. For Yahweh Sabaoth, the God of Israel, says this: Do not be deceived by the prophets who are with you or by your diviners; do not listen to the dreams you have, since they prophesy lies to you in my name. I have not sent them, Yahweh declares. For Yahweh says this: When the seventy years granted to Babylon are over, I shall intervene on your behalf and fulfil my favourable promise to you by bringing you back to this place. Yes, I know what plans I have in mind for you, Yahweh declares, plans for peace, not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope. When you call to me and come and pray to me, I shall listen to you. When you search for me, you will find me; when you search wholeheartedly for me, I shall let you find me (Yahweh declares. I shall restore your fortunes and gather you in from all the nations and wherever I have driven you, Yahweh declares. I shall bring you back to the place from which I exiled you).</p>

	<p>“Since you say: Yahweh has raised up prophets for us in Babylon — this is what Yahweh says about the king now occupying the throne of David and all the people living in this city, your brothers who did not go with you into exile: Yahweh Sabaoth says this: I am now going to send them sword, famine and plague; I shall make them like rotten figs, so bad as to be uneatable. I shall pursue them with sword, famine and plague. I shall make them an object of terror to all the kingdoms of the earth, a curse, a thing of horror, scorn and derision to all the nations where I have driven them, because they have refused to listen to my words, Yahweh declares, although I have persistently sent them all my servants the prophets; but they would not listen, Yahweh declares. But all you exiles, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon, listen to Yahweh’s word!</p>

	<p>“This is what Yahweh Sabaoth, God of Israel, says about Ahab son of Kolaiah, and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, who prophesy lies to you in my name: I shall hand them over now to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon who will put them to death before your very eyes. This curse, based on their fate, will be used by all the exiles of Judah in Babylon: May Yahweh treat you like Zedekiah and Ahab, roasted alive by the king of Babylon, because they have done a scandalous thing in Israel, committing adultery with their neighbour’s wives and speaking lying words in my name without orders from me. I know all the same and am witness to it, Yahweh declares”.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Prophecy against Shemaiah (29:24–32)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p>“And to Shemaiah of Nehelam you will speak as follows: Yahweh Sabaoth, God of Israel, says this: Since you, on your own initiative, have sent a letter to all the people in Jerusalem, to the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah (and to all the priests), saying: Yahweh has appointed you priest in place of the priest Jehoiada to keep order in the Temple of Yahweh, to put any crazy fellow posing as a prophet in the stocks and collar, why then have you not disciplined Jeremiah of Anathoth, now posing as a prophet to you? Why, he has even sent us a message in Babylon, saying: It will be a long time. Build houses, settle down; plant gardens and eat what they produce”.…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Now, after the priest Zephaniah had read this letter to the prophet Jeremiah), the word of Yahweh came then to Jeremiah as follows, “Send this message to all the exiles, ‘This is what Yahweh says about Shemaiah of Nehelam: Since Shemaiah has prophesied to you without my sending him, and since he has caused you to rely on what is false for that reason, Yahweh declares, I shall punish Shemaiah of Nehelam and his descendants; no male member of his family will survive among this people to see the happiness that I will bestow on my people’”, (Yahweh declares, since he has preached rebellion against Yahweh).</p>

<h3 id="iiic">C: The Book of Consolation (30:1–31:40)</h3>

<h4>Promise of recovery for Israel (30:1–31:22)</h4>

<p>The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, as follows, “Yahweh, God of Israel, says this, ‘Write for yourself in a book all the words I have spoken to you. For look, the days are coming, Yahweh declares, when I shall bring back the captives of my people Israel (and Judah), Yahweh says. I shall make them come back and take possession of the country I gave to their ancestors’”.</p>

<p>These are the words Yahweh spoke about Israel (and Judah):</p>

<blockquote>

		<span>We have heard a cry of panic,</span><br />

<h4>Promise of restoration to Judah (31:23–26)</h4>

<p>Yahweh Sabaoth, the God of Israel, says this, “In the country of Judah and in its towns, they will use these words once more, when I bring their captives home:</p> 

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>‘Yahweh bless you,</span><br />
		<span>home of saving justice,</span><br />
		<span>holy mountain!’.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“And in this country, Judah and all its towns, the ploughmen and those who wander with their flocks, will live together, for I shall give the weary all they need and satisfy all those whose strength has gone”.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>At this, I awoke and saw</span><br />
		<span>that my sleep had been sweet to me.</span>

<h4>Israel and Judah (31:27–28)</h4>

<p>“Look, the days are coming, Yahweh declares, when I shall sow the House of Israel and the House of Judah with the seed both of people and of cattle. And as I once watched over them to uproot, to knock down, to overthrow, destroy and bring disaster, so now I shall watch over them to build and to plant, Yahweh declares.</p>

<h4>Individual retribution (31:29–30)</h4>

<p>“In those days people will no longer say:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>‘The fathers have eaten unripe grapes;</span><br />

<p>But each will die for his own guilt. Everyone who eats unripe grapes will have his own teeth set on edge.</p>

<h4>The new covenant (31:31–34)</h4>

<p>“Look, the days are coming, Yahweh declares, when I shall make a new covenant with the House of Israel (and the House of Judah), but not like the covenant I made with their ancestors the day I took them by the hand to bring them out of Egypt, a covenant which they broke, even though I was their Master, Yahweh declares. No, this is the covenant I shall make with the House of Israel when those days have come, Yahweh declares. Within them I shall plant my Law, writing it on their hearts. Then I shall be their God and they will be my people. There will be no further need for everyone to teach neighbour or brother, saying, ‘Learn to know Yahweh!’. No, they will all know me, from the least to the greatest, Yahweh declares, since I shall forgive their guilt and never more call their sin to mind”.</p>

<h4>Jerusalem magnificently rebuilt (31:38–40)</h4>

<p>“Look, the days are coming, Yahweh declares, when the City will be rebuilt for Yahweh, from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate. Then once again the measuring line will stretch straight to the Hill of Gareb, turning then to Goah.

<h3 id="iiid">D: Additions to the Book of Consolation (32:1–33:26)</h3>

<h4>Jeremiah buys a field in token of future prosperity (32:1–44)</h4>

<p>The word that came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar. The army of the king of Babylon was then besieging Jerusalem, and the prophet Jeremiah was confined in the Court of the Guard in the king of Judah’s palace, where Zedekiah king of Judah had confined him, saying, “Why do you keep prophesying like this, ‘Yahweh says this: I am going to hand this city over to the king of Babylon and he will capture it; and Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape the clutches of the Chaldaeans, but will certainly be handed over to the king of Babylon, speak to him personally and see him face to face. He will take Zedekiah away to Babylon and there he will stay (until I attend to him, Yahweh declares. If you fight the Chaldaeans you will not succeed!)’”.</p>

<p>Jeremiah said, “The word of Yahweh has been addressed to me as follows, ‘Look, Hanamel the son of your uncle Shallum will come to you and say: Buy my field at Anathoth, for you have the right of redemption to purchase it’. And, as Yahweh had said, my cousin Hanamel came to me, in the Court of the Guard and said, ‘Buy my field at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin, for you have the right of inheritance and right of redemption; buy it’. I knew then that this was Yahweh’s order. Accordingly, I bought the field from my cousin Hanamel of Anathoth and weighed him out the money: seventeen silver shekels. I drew up the deeds and sealed it, called in witnesses and weighed out the money on the scales. I then took both the sealed deed of purchase (with its stipulations and clauses) and its open copy and handed over the deed of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah, son of Mahseiah, in the presence of my cousin Hanamel, of the witnesses who had signed the deed of purchase, and of all the Judaeans who then happened to be in the Court of the Guard. In their presence I gave Baruch this order, ‘Yahweh Sabaoth, God of Israel, says this: Take these deeds, the sealed deed of purchase and its open copy, and put them in an earthenware pot, so that they may be preserved for a long time. For Yahweh Sabaoth, God of Israel, says this: Houses, fields and vineyards will again be bought in this country’.</p>

<p>“After I had entrusted the deed of purchase to Baruch son of Neriah, I prayed to Yahweh as follows, ‘Ah, Lord Yahweh, you made the heavens and the earth by your great power and outstretched arm. To you nothing is impossible. You show faithful love to thousands but repay the fathers’ guilt in full to their children after them. Great and mighty God, whose name is Yahweh Sabaoth, great in purpose, mighty in deed, whose eyes are open on all human ways, rewarding every individual as that person’s ways and actions deserve! You performed signs and wonders in Egypt, as you still do in Israel and among humanity today. You have won the name for yourself which is yours today. You brought your people Israel out of Egypt with signs and wonders, with mighty hand and outstretched arm and fearsome terror. Then you gave them this country which you had promised on oath to their ancestors, a country flowing with milk and honey. They then entered it, taking possession of it, but they would not listen to your voice nor follow your Law: they would do nothing you ordered them to do; and so you made this total disaster befall them. Look! The earthworks are already in place to take the city and, by means of sword, famine and plague, the city is now within the clutches of the Chaldaeans attacking it. What you said has now come true, as you see. Yet you yourself, Lord Yahweh, told me: Buy the field, pay for it, have it witnessed although the city is already in the Chaldaeans’ clutches’”.</p>

<p>The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows, “Look, I am Yahweh, God of all humanity. Is anything impossible to me?</p>

<p>“So, Yahweh says this, ‘I shall hand this city over to the Chaldaeans and to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will capture it; the Chaldaeans attacking this city will enter it, fire it and burn it to the ground, with the houses on whose roofs incense has been offered to Baal and libations poured to other gods, to provoke my anger. For the people of Israel and Judah alike have done nothing but what displeases me since they were young. (The people of Israel in fact have done nothing but provoke my anger by their actions, Yahweh declares.) Yes, from the day when this city was built until today, it has been such cause of anger and wrath to me that I mean to remove it from my sight, on account of all the wickedness the people of Israel and the people of Judah have done to provoke my anger; they, their kings, their chief men, their priests, their prophets, the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. They turned to me their backs, never their faces; and though I taught them so urgently, so untiringly, they would not listen and accept correction. Instead, they set up their Horrors in the Temple that bears my name to defile it, and built the high places of Baal in the Valley of Ben-Hinnom, to burn their sons and daughters alive in honour of Molech: a thing I have never ordered, that had never entered my thoughts — that they would cause Judah to sin by anything so loathsome!</p>

<p>‘So now, this is what Yahweh, God of Israel, says about this city of which you now say: By means of sword, famine and plague, it is already within the king of Babylon’s clutches: Look, I shall gather them in from all the countries where I have driven them in my anger, my fury and great wrath. I shall bring them back to this place and make them live in safety. Then they will be my people, and I shall be their God. I shall give them singleness of heart and singleness of conduct so that they will always fear me, for their own good and that of their children after them. I shall make an everlasting covenant with them, never to cease in my efforts for their welfare, and I shall put respect for me in their hearts, so that they will never turn away from me again. My joy will lie in them and in doing them good, and I shall plant them firmly in this country, with all my heart and soul. For Yahweh says this: Just as I have brought this complete and total disaster on this people, so I shall bring them all the good things I have promised them. Fields will again be bought in this country of which you now say: It is a wasteland without human or animal, already in the clutches of the Chaldaeans. People will buy fields, pay money, draw up deeds, seal them and have them witnessed in the territory of Benjamin, in the districts around Jerusalem, in the towns of Judah, of the highlands, of the lowlands and of the Negeb. For I shall bring back their captives, Yahweh declares’”.</p>

<h4>Another promise of recovery (33:1–13)</h4>

<p>Jeremiah was still confined to the Court of the Guard when the word of Yahweh came to him a second time, as follows, “Yahweh who made the earth, who formed it and set it firm — Yahweh is his name — says this, ‘Call to me and I will answer you; I will tell you great secrets of which you know nothing. For this is what Yahweh, God of Israel, says about the houses of this city and the palaces of the kings of Judah which are about to be destroyed by means of the earthworks and the sword; about those now fighting the Chaldaeans, only to fill the city with corpses, those whom I have slaughtered in my furious anger, those whose wickedness has made me hide my face from this city: Look, I shall bring them remedy and cure; I shall cure them and reveal a new order of peace and loyalty to them. I shall bring back the captives of Judah and the captives of Israel and shall rebuild them as before. I shall cleanse them of all their guilt, by which they have offended me, I shall forgive all their guilty actions, by which they have offended me and rebelled against me. And, for me, Jerusalem will become a name of joy and praise and pride for all the nations on earth to see; when they hear of all the prosperity that I shall give, they will be seized with fear and trembling at all the prosperity and the peace that I provide for it’.</p>

<p>“Yahweh says this, ‘In this place of which you now say: It is a ruin, without human or animal, in the towns of Judah and desolate streets of Jerusalem where there is neither human nor animal, once more will be heard shouts of rejoicing and mirth, the voices of bridegroom and bride, and the singing of those who bring thanksgiving sacrifices to the Temple of Yahweh: Give thanks to Yahweh Sabaoth, for Yahweh is good, for his faithful love is everlasting. For I shall bring back the country’s captives, as before, Yahweh says’.</p>

<p>“Yahweh Sabaoth says this, ‘In this ruinous place, without human or animal, in all its towns, once again there will be pastures for the shepherds to rest their flocks. In the towns of the highlands, of the lowlands and the Negeb, in the territory of Benjamin, in the districts around Jerusalem and in the towns of Judah, once again the flocks shall pass under the hand of someöne who counts them, Yahweh says.</p>

<h4>The institutions of the future (33:14–26)</h4>

<p>‘Look, the days are coming, Yahweh declares, when I shall fulfil the promise of happiness I made to the House of Israel and the House of Judah:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>In those days and at that time,</span><br />
		<span>I shall make an upright Branch grow for David,</span><br />
		<span>who will do what is just and upright in the country.</span><br />
		<span>In those days Judah will triumph</span><br />
		<span>and Israel live in safety.</span><br />
		<span>And this is the name the city will be called:</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh-is-our-Saving-Justice’.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“For Yahweh says this, ‘David will never lack a male descendant to occupy the throne of the House of Israel, nor will the levitical priests ever lack male descendants to stand before me and offer the burnt offering, to burn the cereal offering and offer sacrifice every day’”.</p>

<p>The word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah as follows, “Yahweh says this, ‘If you could break my covenant with the day and my covenant with the night so that day and night do not come at their due time, then my covenant with David my servant might also be broken and he would have no son to reign on his throne, and so also might my covenant with the levitical priests, who are my ministers. As surely as the array of heaven cannot be counted, nor the sand of the sea be measured, so surely shall I increase the heirs of David my servant and the Levites who minister to me’”.</p>

<p>The word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah as follows, “Have you not noticed what these people say, ‘The two families which Yahweh chose he has now rejected’? So they despise my people, whom they no longer think of as a nation. Yahweh says this, ‘If I have not created day and night and fixed the laws governing heaven and earth, why, then I shall reject the descendants of Jacob and of David my servant and cease to choose rulers from his descendants for the heirs of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob! For I shall bring back their captives and take pity on them’”.</p>

<h3 id="iiie">E: Miscellaneous Prophecies (34:1–35:19)</h3>

<h4>The fate of Zedekiah (34:1–7)</h4>

<p>The word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and his whole army, with all the kingdoms of the earth under his dominion and all the peoples, were waging war on Jerusalem and all its towns, “Yahweh, God of Israel, says this, ‘Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah and tell him, Yahweh says this: I am going to hand this city over to the power of the king of Babylon, and he will burn it down. And you yourself will not escape his clutches but will certainly be captured and handed over to him. You will see the king of Babylon face to face and speak to him personally. Then you will go to Babylon. Even so, listen to the word of Yahweh, Zedekiah king of Judah! This is what Yahweh says about you: You will not die by the sword; you will die in peace. And as spices were burnt for your ancestors, the kings who in times past preceded you, so spices will be burnt for you and a dirge sung for you: Alas for his highness! I have spoken, Yahweh declares’”.</p>

<p>The prophet Jeremiah repeated all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem, while the army of the king of Babylon was attacking Jerusalem and all such towns of Judah as still held out, namely Lachish and Azekah, these being the only fortified towns of Judah remaining.</p>

<h4>The episode of the liberated slaves (34:8–22)</h4>

<p>The word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to issue a proclamation freeing their slaves: each man was to free his Hebrew slaves, men and women, no one was any longer to keep a brother Judaean in slavery. All the chief men and all the people who had entered into the covenant had agreed that everyone should free his slaves, men or women, and no longer keep them as slaves: they had agreed on this and set them free. Afterwards, however, they changed their minds, recovered the slaves, men and women, whom they had set free, and reduced them to slavery again. The word of Yahweh came then to Jeremiah as follows, “Yahweh, God of Israel, says this, ‘I made a covenant with your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, out of the house of slavery; it said: At the end of seven years each one of you is to free his brother Hebrew who has sold himself to you: he may be your slave for six years, then you must send him away free. But your ancestors did not listen to me and would not pay attention. Now, today you repented and did what pleases me by proclaiming freedom for your neighbour; you made a covenant before me in the Temple that bears my name. And then you changed your minds and, profaning my name, each of you has recovered his slaves, men and women, whom you had sent away free to live their own lives, and has forced them to become your slaves again’.</p>

<p>“So Yahweh says this: ‘You have disobeyed me, by failing to grant freedom to brother and neighbour. Very well, I in my turn, Yahweh declares, shall leave sword, famine and plague free to deal with you and I shall make you an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth. As for the people who have broken my covenant, who have not observed the terms of the covenant which they made before me, I shall treat them like the calf that people cut in two to pass between its pieces. The chief men of Judah and Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests, and all the country people who have passed between the pieces of the calf, I shall hand over to their enemies and those determined to kill them, and their corpses will be food for the birds of the sky and the animals of earth. As for Zedekiah king of Judah and his chief men, I shall hand them to their enemies, to those determined to kill them, and to the army of the king of Babylon which has just withdrawn. Listen, I shall give the order, Yahweh declares, and bring them back to this city to attack it and capture it and burn it down. And I shall make an uninhabited waste of the towns of Judah’”.</p>

<h4>The example of the Rechabites (35:1–19)</h4>

<p>The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, “Go to the clan of the Rechabites and speak to them; bring them into one of the rooms of the Temple of Yahweh and offer them wine to drink”. So I took Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah, with his brothers and all his sons, the whole Rechabite clan, and brought them to the Temple of Yahweh into the room of Ben-Johanan son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which was next to that of the chief men, above the room of Maaseiah son of Shallum, guardian of the threshold.</p>
	
<p>I then set pitchers full of wine, and some cups, before the members of the Rechabite clan and said, “Drink some wine”.</p>

<p>But they replied, “We do not drink wine, because our ancestor Jonadab son of Rechab gave us this order, ‘You must not drink wine, neither you nor your sons for ever; nor must you build houses, sow seed, plant vineyards or own them, but must live in tents all your lives, so that you may live long on the soil to which you are alien’. We have punctiliously obeyed the orders of our ancestor, Jonadab son of Rechab, never drinking wine ourselves, nor our wives, our sons or our daughters, not building houses to live in, owning neither vineyard nor field nor seed, living in tents. We have obeyed the orders of our ancestor Jonadab, respecting them in every particular. However, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon invaded this country, we decided, ‘We must get away! We will go to Jerusalem to escape the armies of the Chaldaeans and Aramaeans’. So that is why we are living in Jerusalem”.</p>

<p>Then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah as follows, “Yahweh Sabaoth, the God of Israel, says this, ‘Go and say to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: Will you never learn the lesson and listen to my words, Yahweh demands? The words of Jonadab son of Rechab, ordering his sons to drink no wine, have been observed; obedient to their ancestor’s command, they drink none even today . But to me, who spoke to you so urgently, so untiringly, you have not listened. I have urgently and untiringly sent you all my servants the prophets to say: Turn back, each one of you, from your evil behaviour and amend your actions, do not follow other gods to serve them, and you will go on living on the soil I gave to you and your ancestors. But you have not paid attention or listened to me. Thus the sons of Jonadab son of Rechab have kept the command their ancestor gave them, but this people has not listened to me. And so, Yahweh, God Sabaoth, God of Israel, says this: Look, on Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem I am going to bring all the disaster which I have decreed for them, because I spoke to them and they would not listen, called to them and they would not answer’”.</p>

<p>Then Jeremiah said to the Rechabite clan, “Yahweh Sabaoth, the God of Israel, says this, ‘Because you have obeyed the orders of your ancestor Jonadab and observed all his rules and done everything he ordered you to do, therefore, Yahweh Sabaoth, the God of Israel, says this: Jonadab son of Rechab will never lack a male descendant to stand before me for ever’”.</p>

<h2 id="iv">The Sufferings of Jeremiah (36:1–45:5)</h2>

<h4>The scroll written in 605–604 BC (36:1–32)</h4>

<p>In the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from Yahweh, “Take a scroll and on it write all the words I have spoken to you about Israel, Judah and all the nations, from the day I first spoke to you, in the time of Josiah, until today. Perhaps when the House of Judah hears about all the disaster I intend to inflict on them, they will turn, each one of them, from their evil behaviour, so that I can forgive their sinful guilt”. Jeremiah then summoned Baruch son of Neriah, who at his dictation wrote down on the scroll all the words Yahweh had spoken to him.</p>

<p>Jeremiah then gave Baruch this order, “As I am prevented from entering the Temple of Yahweh, you yourself must go and, from the scroll you wrote at my dictation, read all Yahweh’s words to the people in his Temple on the day of the fast, and in this way you can read them in the hearing also of all the Judaeans who come in from their towns. Perhaps their prayers will move Yahweh and they will turn one and all from their evil behaviour, for great is the furious anger with which Yahweh has threatened this people”. Baruch son of Neriah duly carried out the order that the prophet Jeremiah had given him, to read all Yahweh’s words from the book in his Temple.</p>

<p>Now, in the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people of Jerusalem and all the people who could get to Jerusalem from the towns of Judah were summoned to a fast before Yahweh. Baruch then read Jeremiah’s words from the book; this happened in the room of Gemariah son of the scribe Shaphan, in the upper court at the entry of the New Gate of the Temple of Yahweh, where all the people could hear.</p>

<p>Micaiah son of Gemariah, son of Shaphan, having heard all Yahweh’s words read from the book, went down to the royal palace, to the scribe’s room. All the chief men were in session: the scribe Elishama, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Achbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah and all the other chief men; and to them Micaiah reported all the words he heard as Baruch was reading the book aloud to the people. The chief men then by common consent sent Jehudi son of Netaniah to Baruch, with Shelemiah son of Cushi, to say, “Come, and bring the scroll with you which you have been reading to the people”. Bringing the scroll with him, Baruch son of Neriah appeared before them. “Sit down”, they said, “and read it out”. So Baruch read it to them. Having heard all the words they turned to one another in alarm and said to Baruch, “We must certainly inform the king of this”. They then questioned Baruch, “Tell us”, they said, “how you came to write all these words”.</p>
	
<p>“Jeremiah dictated them all to me”, Baruch replied, “and I wrote them down in ink in this book”.</p>

<p>The chief men said to Baruch, “You and Jeremiah had better go into hiding; and do not tell anyone where you are”. Whereüpon they went off to the king in the palace court, depositing the scroll in the room of the scribe Elishama. They then informed the king of the whole affair.</p>

<p>The king sent Jehudi for the scroll, and he brought it from the room of the scribe Elishama and read it to the king and all the chief men standing around the king. The king was sitting in his winter apartments — it was the ninth month — with a fire burning in a brazier in front of him. Each time Jehudi had read three or four columns, the king cut them off with a scribe’s knife and threw them into the fire in the brazier until the whole of the scroll had been burnt in the brazier fire. But in spite of hearing all these words, neither the king nor any of his courtiers took alarm or tore their clothes; and although Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had urged the king not to burn the scroll he would not listen to them, but ordered the king’s son Jerahmeel and Seraiah son of Azriel and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest the scribe Baruch and the prophet Jeremiah. But Yahweh had hidden them.</p>

<p>Then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah, after the king had burnt the scroll containing the words Baruch had written at Jeremiah’s dictation, “Take another scroll and write down all the words that were written on the first scroll burnt by Jehoiakim king of Judah. And as regards Jehoiakim king of Judah, you are to say, ‘Yahweh says this: You have burnt that scroll, saying: Why have you written down: The king of Babylon will certainly come and lay this country waste and leave it without human or animal? So, this is what Yahweh says about Jehoiakim king of Judah: He will have no one to occupy the throne of David, and his corpse will be tossed out to the heat of the day and the frost of the night. I shall punish him, his offspring and his courtiers for their guilt; on them, on the citizens of Jerusalem and on the people of Judah I shall bring the total disaster which I had decreed for them but to which they have paid no attention’”.</p>

<p>Jeremiah then took another scroll and gave it to the scribe Baruch son of Neriah, who in it at Jeremiah’s dictation wrote all the words of the book that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burnt, with many similar words in addition.</p>

<h4>A verdict on Zedekiah (37:1–2)</h4>

<p>Zedekiah son of Josiah became king, succeeding Coniah son of Jehoiakim. Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had made him king of Judah. But neither he nor his courtiers nor the people of the country paid any attention to the words Yahweh spoke through the prophet Jeremiah.</p>

<h4>Zedekiah consults Jeremiah during the respite of 588 BC (37:3–10)</h4>

<p>King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to the prophet Jeremiah with this message, “Intercede for us with Yahweh our God”. Now Jeremiah was still moving freely among the people: he had not yet been put in prison. Meanwhile Pharaoh’s army was on the move from Egypt and the Chaldaeans besieging Jerusalem had raised the siege when they heard the news.</p>

<p>Then the word of Yahweh came to the prophet Jeremiah as follows, “Yahweh, God of Israel, says this, ‘To the king of Judah who sent you to consult me make this reply: Is Pharaoh’s army marching to your aid? It will withdraw to its own country, Egypt. The Chaldaeans will return to attack this city; they will capture it and burn it down. Yahweh says this: Do not cheer yourselves up by thinking: The Chaldaeans are leaving us for good. They are not leaving. Even if you cut to pieces the whole Chaldaean army now fighting against you until there were only the wounded left, they would stand up again, each man in his tent, to burn this city down’”.</p>

<h4>The arrest of Jeremiah. Improvement in his treatment (37:11–21)</h4>

<p>At the time when the Chaldaean army, threatened by Pharaoh’s army, had raised the siege of Jerusalem, Jeremiah set out from Jerusalem for the territory of Benjamin to see about a piece of his property among the people there. He was at the Benjamin Gate when the guard commander there, a certain Irijah son of Shelemiah, son of Hananiah, arrested the prophet Jeremiah, shouting, “You are deserting to the Chaldaeans!”.</p>
	
<p>Jeremiah answered, “It is a lie! I am not deserting to the Chaldaeans”. But Irijah would not listen to Jeremiah and took him under arrest to the chief men. And the chief men, furious with Jeremiah, had him beaten and shut up in the house of the scribe Jonathan, which had been turned into a prison. Thus Jeremiah found himself in an underground vault. And there for a long time he stayed.</p>

<p>Later, King Zedekiah had him sent for, and the king questioned him privately in his palace. “Is there any word from Yahweh?”, he asked.</p>

<p>“There is”, Jeremiah answered, and added, “you will be handed over to the king of Babylon”. Jeremiah then said to King Zedekiah, “What wrong have I done you, or your courtiers or this people, for you to have put me in prison? Where are your prophets now who prophesied, ‘The king of Babylon will not attack you or this country?’ So now I beg you to hear me, my lord king! I beg you to approve my request! Do not have me taken back to the house of the scribe Jonathan, or I shall die there”. King Zedekiah then gave an order, and Jeremiah was confined in the Court of the Guard and given a loaf of bread a day from the Street of the Bakers as long as there was bread left in the city. So Jeremiah stayed in the Court of the Guard.</p>

<h4>Jeremiah is thrown into the storage-well. Ebed-Melech intervenes (38:1–13)</h4>

<p>But Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jucal son of Shelemiah and Pashhur son of Malchiah heard the words which Jeremiah was saying to all the people, “Yahweh says this, ‘Anyone who stays in this city will die by sword, famine or plague; but anyone who leaves it and surrenders to the Chaldaeans will live; he will escape with his life. Yahweh says this: This city will certainly be handed over to the army of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it’”.</p>

<p>The chief men then said to the king, “You must have this man put to death: he is unquestionably disheartening the remaining soldiers in the city, and all the people too, by talking like this. This man is seeking not the welfare of the people but their ruin”.</p>

<p>King Zedekiah answered, “He is in your hands as you know, for the king is powerless to oppose you”. So they took Jeremiah and put him into the storage-well of the king’s son Malchiah in the Court of the Guard, letting him down with ropes. There was no water in the storage-well, only mud, and into the mud Jeremiah sank.</p>

<p>But Ebed-Melech the Cushite, a eunuch attached to the palace, heard that Jeremiah had been put into the storage-well. As the king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate, Ebed-Melech came out from the palace and spoke to the king. “My lord king”, he said, “these men have done a wicked thing by treating the prophet Jeremiah like this: they have thrown him into the storage-well. He will starve to death there, since there is no more food in the city”.</p>

<p>At this the king gave Ebed-Melech the Cushite the following order: “Take thirty men with you from here and pull the prophet Jeremiah out of the storage-well before he dies”. Ebed-Melech took the men with him and went into the palace to the Treasury wardrobe; out of it he took some torn, worn-out rags which he lowered on ropes to Jeremiah in the storage-well.</p>

<p>Ebed-Melech the Cushite then said to Jeremiah, “These torn, worn-out rags are for you to put under your armpits to pad the ropes”. Jeremiah did this. Then they hauled Jeremiah up with the ropes and pulled him out of the storage-well. And Jeremiah stayed in the Court of the Guard.</p>

<h4>The last conversation between Jeremiah and Zedekiah (38:14–28)</h4>

<p>King Zedekiah had the prophet Jeremiah summoned to him at the third entrance to the Temple of Yahweh. “I want to ask you for a word”, the king said to Jeremiah, “keep nothing back from me”.</p>

<p>Jeremiah answered Zedekiah, “If I do proclaim it to you, are you not sure to have me put to death? And if I give you advice, you will not listen to me”.</p>

<p>King Zedekiah then secretly swore this oath to Jeremiah, “As Yahweh lives, giver of this life of ours, I will have you neither put to death nor handed over to these men who are determined to kill you”.</p>

<p>Jeremiah then said to Zedekiah, “Yahweh, God Sabaoth, God of Israel, says this, ‘If you go out and surrender to the king of Babylon’s generals, your life will be safe and this city will not be burnt down; you and your family will survive. But if you do not go out and surrender to the king of Babylon’s generals, this city will be handed over to the Chaldaeans and they will burn it down; nor will you yourself escape their clutches’”.</p>

<p>King Zedekiah then said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Judaeans who have already gone over to the Chaldaeans: I might be handed over to them and they would ill-treat me”.</p>

<p>“You will not be handed over to them”, Jeremiah replied. “Please listen to Yahweh’s voice as I have relayed it to you, and then all will go well with you and your life will be safe. But if you refuse to surrender, this is what Yahweh has shown me: the sight of all the women left in the king of Judah’s palace being led off to the king of Babylon’s generals and saying:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>‘They have misled you, they have triumphed over you,</span><br />
		<span>those friends of yours!</span><br />
		<span>Your feet have sunk in the mud!</span><br />
		<span>They are up and away!’.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Yes, all your wives and children will be led off to the Chaldaeans, and you yourself will not escape their clutches but will be a prisoner in the clutches of the king of Babylon. And as for this city, it will be burnt down”.</p>

<p>Zedekiah then said to Jeremiah, “Do not let anyone else hear these words or you will die. If the chief men hear that I have been talking to you, and come and say, ‘Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you; keep nothing back from us, or we shall put you to death’, you must reply, ‘I presented this request to the king: that he would not have me sent back to Jonathan’s house to die’”.</p>

<p>And in fact all the chief men came to Jeremiah and questioned him. He told them exactly what the king had ordered him to say. They then left him in peace, since the conversation had not been overheard. And Jeremiah stayed in the Court of the Guard until the day Jerusalem was captured. And he was there when Jerusalem actually was captured.</p>

<h4>The fall of Jerusalem and what happened to Jeremiah (39:1–14)</h4>

<p>In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon advanced on Jerusalem with his entire army, and they laid siege to it. In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, a breach was made in the city wall.</p>

<p>The king of Babylon’s officials, all having made their entry, took their seats in the Middle Gate: Nergal-Sharezer, Samgar-Nebo, Sar-Sechim a high dignitary of state, Nergal-Sharezer the chief astrologer, and all the king of Babylon’s other officials</p>

<p>On seeing them, Zedekiah king of Judah and all the fighting men fled, leaving the city under cover of dark, by way of the king’s garden through the gate between the two walls, and made their way towards the Arabah. But the Chaldaean troops pursued them and caught up with Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. They captured him and took him to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon at Riblah in the territory of Hamath, where he passed sentence on him. The king of Babylon had Zedekiah’s sons slaughtered before his eyes at Riblah; the king of Babylon also had all the leading men of Judah put to death. He then put out Zedekiah’s eyes and, loading him with chains, carried him off to Babylon. The Chaldaeans burnt down the royal palace and the private houses, and demolished the walls of Jerusalem. Nebuzaradan commander of the guard deported the remainder of the population left behind in the city, the deserters who had gone over to him, and the rest of the artisans to Babylon. But Nebuzaradan commander of the guard left some of the poor people behind in the country of Judah, those who had nothing, at the same time giving them vineyards and fields.</p>

<p>With regard to Jeremiah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had given the following orders to Nebuzaradan, commander of the guard, “Take him, look after him; do him no harm, but treat him as he may ask you”.</p>

<p>He entrusted this mission to (Nebuzaradan commander of the guard,) Nebushazban the high dignitary of state, Nergal-Sharezer the chief astrologer and all the king of Babylon’s other officials.</p>

<p>These despatched men to take Jeremiah from the Court of the Guard and turned him over to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan for safe conduct home. So he remained among the people.</p>

<h4>A prophecy assuring the safety of Ebed-Melech (39:15–18)</h4>

<p>While Jeremiah was confined in the Court of the Guard, the word of Yahweh came to him as follows, “Go and say to Ebed-Melech the Cushite, ‘Yahweh, God of Israel says this: Look, I am about to perform my words about this city for its ruin and not for its prosperity. That day they will come true before your eyes. But I shall rescue you that day, Yahweh declares, and you will not be handed over to the hands of the men you fear. Yes, I shall certainly rescue you: you will not fall to the sword; you will escape with your life, because you have put your trust in me, Yahweh declares’.</p>

<h4>Further details about the treatment of Jeremiah (40:1–6)</h4>

<p>The word which came to Jeremiah from Yahweh after Nebuzaradan commander of the guard had released him from Ramah, where he had found him in chains with all the other captives from Jerusalem and Judah who were being deported to Babylon:</p>

<p>The commander of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him, “Yahweh your God foretold calamity for this country, and now he has brought it. He has done what he threatened to do, because you had sinned against Yahweh and would not listen to his voice; so all this has happened to you. Look, today I am having your hands unchained. If you like to come with me to Babylon, come: I shall look after you. If you do not want to come with me to Babylon, do not. Look, you have the whole country before you: go wherever you think it best and most suitable to go”. And before Jeremiah retired, he added, “You can go back to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed governor of the towns of Judah, and stay with him among the people, or go anywhere else you think suitable”. With that, the commander of the guard gave him provisions and a present, and dismissed him. Jeremiah went to Mizpah, to Gedaliah son of Ahikam and stayed with him, among those people still left in the country.</p>

<h4>Gedaliah the governor; his assassination (40:7–41–18)</h4>

<p>When the military leaders who with their men were still in the field, all heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam as governor of the country, making him responsible for the men, women and children, and those of the poor country people who had not been deported to Babylon, they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah: Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, Jezaniah son of the Maacathite, they and their men. To them and to their men Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, swore an oath. “Do not be afraid”, he said, “of serving the Chaldaeans, stay in the country, serve the king of Babylon, and all will go well with you. I for my part, as the man answerable to the Chaldaeans when they come to us, shall stay here at Mizpah, whereäs you can harvest the wine, summer fruit and oil, fill your storage jars and settle in the towns which you have seized”.</p>

<p>Similarly, when all the Judaeans living in Moab, with the Ammonites, in Edom and elsewhere, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan as their governor, the Judaeans all came back from wherever they had been driven. On their return to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, they harvested an immense quantity of wine and summer fruit.</p>

<p>Now Johanan son of Kareah and all the military leaders still in the field, came to Gedaliah at Mizpah and said to him, “Are you aware that Baalis king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to assassinate you?”. But Gedaliah son of Ahikam would not believe them.</p>

<p>Johanan son of Kareah then spoke in secret to Gedaliah at Mizpah, as follows: “Please let me go and kill Ishmael son of Nethaniah, and no one will be any the wiser. Why should he assassinate you and cause the dispersal of all the Judaeans who have rallied around you. Why should the remnant of Judah perish?”.</p>

<p>But Gedaliah son of Ahikam replied to Johanan son of Kareah, “You will do no such thing, for what you say about Ishmael is false”.</p>

<p>In the seventh month, however, Ishmael son of Nethaniah son of Elishama, who was of royal descent, came with officers of the king and ten men to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah. And as they were taking their meal together, there at Mizpah, Ishmael son of Nethaniah stood up with his ten men, and attacking Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, with their swords, they killed the man whom the king of Babylon had made governor of the country. And all the Judaeans who were with him, that is with Gedaliah at Mizpah, and the Chaldaean soldiers who happened to be there, Ishmael killed too.</p>

<p>On the day after the murder of Gedaliah, before the news had become known, eighty men arrived from Shechem, Shiloh and Samaria, with their beards shaved off, their clothing torn, and covered in self-inflicted gashes; they were bringing cereal offerings and incense with them to present to the Temple of Yahweh. Ishmael son of Nethaniah went out of Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went. When he met them he said, “Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam”. But once they were well inside the town, Ishmael son of Nethaniah slaughtered them, with the help of his men, and had them thrown into the storage-well.</p>

<p>There were ten of them, however, who said to Ishmael, “Do not kill us: we have stocks of wheat and barley, oil and honey, hidden away in the fields”. So he spared them and did not kill them with their brothers. The storage-well into which Ishmael threw the corpses of all the men he had killed was a large one, the one which King Asa had built as a precaution against Baasha king of Israel. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with the slaughtered men. Ishmael then took all the rest of the people prisoner who were at Mizpah, the king’s daughters and all the remaining people in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan, commander of the guard, had entrusted to Gedaliah son of Ahikam. Ishmael son of Nethaniah took them prisoner and set out, intending to cross over to the Ammonites.</p>

<p>When Johanan son of Kareah and all the military leaders who were with him heard about all the crimes committed by Ishmael son of Nethaniah, they mustered all their men and set out to attack Ishmael son of Nethaniah. They caught up with him at the great Pool of Gibeon. At the sight of Johanan son of Kareah and all the military leaders with him, all the people with Ishmael were delighted. All the people whom Ishmael had taken as prisoners from Mizpah turned about, went back and joined Johanan son of Kareah. Ishmael son of Nethaniah, however, escaped from Johanan with eight of his men and fled to the Ammonites. Johanan son of Kareah and all the military leaders with him then rallied all the remaining people whom Ishmael son of Nethaniah had taken as prisoners from Mizpah after killing Gedaliah son of Ahikam: men — fighting men — women, children and eunuchs, whom they brought back from Gibeon. Setting off, they made a halt at Khan Kimham near Bethlehem, intending to go on to Egypt, to get away from the Chaldaeans. They were now terrified of them, since Ishmael son of Nethaniah had killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam whom the king of Babylon had made governor of the country.</p>

<h4>The flight to Egypt (42:1–43:7)</h4>

<p>Then all the military leaders, in particular Johanan son of Kareah and Azariah son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from least to greatest, approached the prophet Jeremiah and said, “Please hear our petition and intercede with Yahweh your God for us and for all this remnant — and how few of us are left out of many, your own eyes can see — so that Yahweh your God may show us the way we are to go and what we must do”.</p>

<p>The prophet Jeremiah replied, “I hear you; I will indeed pray to Yahweh your God as you ask; and whatever answer Yahweh your God gives you, I will tell you, keeping nothing back from you”.</p>

<p>They in their turn said to Jeremiah, “May Yahweh be a true and faithful witness against us, if we do not follow the instructions that Yahweh your God sends us through you. Whether we like it or not, we shall obey the voice of Yahweh our God to whom we are sending you, so that we may prosper by obeying the voice of Yahweh our God”.</p>

<p>Ten days later the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah. He then summoned Johanan son of Kareah and all the military leaders who were with him, and all the people from least to greatest, and said, “Yahweh, God of Israel, to whom you deputed me to present your petition says this, ‘If you will only stay in this country, I shall build you and not overthrow you; I shall plant you and not uproot you, for I am sorry about the disaster I have inflicted on you. Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, whom you fear now; do not fear him, Yahweh declares, for I am with you to save you and rescue you from his clutches. I shall take pity on you, so that he pities you and lets you return to your native soil. But if you say: We will not stay in this country; if you disobey the voice of Yahweh your God, and say: No, Egypt is where we shall go, where we shall not see war or hear the trumpet-call or go short of food; that is where we want to live; in that case, remnant of Judah, listen to Yahweh’s word: Yahweh Sabaoth, God of Israel, says this: If you are determined to go to Egypt, and if you do go and settle there, the sword you fear will overtake you there in Egypt, and there you will die. Yes, all those who are determined to go to Egypt and settle there, will die by sword, famine and plague: not a single one of them will survive or escape the disaster I shall inflict on them. Yes, Yahweh Sabaoth, the God of Israel, says this: Just as my furious anger was poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so will my fury be poured out on you if you go to Egypt: you will become an object of execration and horror, a curse, a laughing-stock; and you will never see this place again’. Remnant of Judah, Yahweh has told you, ‘Do not go into Egypt’. Understand clearly that today I have given you a solemn warning. You were not being sincere when you sent me to Yahweh your God and said, ‘Intercede for us with Yahweh our God; tell us exactly what Yahweh our God says and we will do it’. Today I have told you, but you have not obeyed the voice of Yahweh your God or any part of the message he sent me to give you. So understand this clearly: you will die by sword, famine and plague in the place where you want to go and settle”.</p>

<p>When Jeremiah had finished telling all the people all the words of Yahweh their God, which Yahweh their God had sent him to tell them — all the words quoted above — Azariah son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan son of Kareah, and all those arrogant men, said to Jeremiah, “You are lying. Yahweh our God did not send you to say, ‘Do not go to Egypt and settle there’. It was Baruch son of Neriah, who keeps inciting you against us, to hand us over to the Chaldaeans so that they can put us to death or deport us to Babylon”.</p>

<p>So neither Johanan nor any of the military leaders nor any of the people obeyed the voice of Yahweh by staying in the country of Judah. Instead, Johanan son of Kareah and all the military leaders led off the entire remnant of Judah, those who had come back from all the nations where they had been driven to live in the country of Judah: men, women, children, the royal princesses too, and every single person that Nebuzaradan commander of the guard had left with Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, including the prophet Jeremiah and Baruch son of Neriah. And so, in disobedience to the voice of Yahweh, they reached Egypt and arrived at Tahpanhes.</p>

<h4>Jeremiah foretells the invasion of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar (43:8–13)</h4>

<p>At Tahpanhes the word of Yahweh was addressed to Jeremiah as follows, “Take some large stones and bury them in the cement on the terrace outside the entrance of Pharaoh’s palace in Tahpanhes, where the Judaeans can see you. Then say to them, ‘Yahweh, God of Israel, says this: Look, I shall send for my servant Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and he will place his throne on these stones I have buried, and spread his canopy above them. When he comes, he will defeat Egypt:</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Those for the plague, to the plague;</span><br />
	<span>those for captivity, to captivity;</span><br />
	<span>those for the sword, to the sword!</span>
</p>

<p>‘He will set fire to the temples of the gods of Egypt; he will burn these gods or take them prisoner; like a shepherd wrapping his cloak around him, so he will wrap Egypt around him, and then leave without anyone laying hands on him. He will break the obelisks of the temple of the Sun in Egypt, and burn down the temples of the gods of Egypt’”.</p>

<h4>The last episode of Jeremiah’s ministry:<br />
the Judaeans in Egypt and the Queen of Heaven (44:1–30)</h4>

<p>The word that came to Jeremiah for all the Judaeans living in Egypt, those, that is, living in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Noph and the territory of Pathros. “Yahweh Sabaoth, God of Israel, says this, ‘You have seen all the disaster I have brought on Jerusalem and all the towns of Judah; today they lie in ruins and uninhabited. This was because of the wicked deeds they committed to provoke my anger, by going and offering incense and serving other gods whom neither they, nor you, nor your ancestors knew anything about, although I urgently and untiringly sent you all my servants the prophets to say: You must not do this loathsome thing, which I hate. But they would not listen or pay attention, and turn from their wickedness and stop offering incense to other gods. And so my furious anger overflowed, burning down the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, which were reduced to ruins and wasteland, as they still are today. And now, Yahweh, God Sabaoth, God of Israel, says this: Why bring complete disaster on yourselves by cutting yourselves off from Judah — your men, women, children and babes in arms — so as to leave yourselves no remnant, by provoking my wrath by your actions, offering incense to other gods in Egypt where you have come to settle, as though bent on your own destruction and on becoming a curse and a laughing-stock for all the nations of the earth? Have you forgotten the wicked deeds of your ancestors, of the kings of Judah and of your princes, your own wicked deeds and those of your wives, committed in the country of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? To this day they have felt neither contrition nor fear; they have not observed my Law or my statutes, which I prescribed for you, as for your ancestors. So, Yahweh Sabaoth, God of Israel, says this: Look, I have determined on disaster and shall destroy Judah completely. I shall take the remnant of Judah who were determined to come to Egypt and settle there, and in Egypt they will perish; they will fall to the sword or perish of famine, from least to greatest; by sword and famine they will die and be an object of execration and horror, a curse, a laughing-stock. I shall punish those who live in Egypt just as I punished Jerusalem: by sword, famine and plague. Of the remnant of Judah which has come to settle in Egypt, not a single one will escape or survive to return to the country of Judah where they long to return and live. For none of them will return, except a few refugees’”.</p>

<p>At this, all the men who knew that their wives offered incense to other gods, and all the women who were standing there, a great crowd (and all the people living in Egypt, in Pathros), answered Jeremiah as follows, “We have no intention of listening to the word you have just spoken to us in Yahweh’s name, but intend to go on doing all we have vowed to do: offering incense to the Queen of Heaven and pouring libations in her honour, as we used to do, we and our ancestors, our kings and our chief men, in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem: we had food in plenty then, we lived well, we suffered no disasters. But since we gave up offering incense to the Queen of Heaven and pouring libations in her honour, we have been destitute and have perished either by sword or by famine. Besides, when we offer incense to the Queen of Heaven and pour libations in her honour, do you think we make cakes for her with her features on them, and pour libations to her, without our husbands’ knowledge?”.</p>

<p>To all the people, men and women, all those who had made this answer, Jeremiah retorted, “The incense you offered in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, you, your ancestors, your kings, your chief men and the people at large — was this not what Yahweh kept remembering, and found so repellent that Yahweh could not endure your misdeeds and your loathsome practices any longer, with the result that your country has become the uninhabited ruin, the object of horror and cursing it is today? Because you offered incense, because you sinned against Yahweh, refusing to listen to the voice of Yahweh, or to observe his Law, his statutes and his decrees — that is why the present disaster has overtaken you”.</p>

<p>Further, Jeremiah said to all the people, and particularly to all the women, “Listen to the word of Yahweh, all you Judaeans in Egypt, Yahweh Sabaoth, God of Israel, says this, ‘You and your wives, what your mouths promised, your hands have indeed performed! You said: We shall punctiliously fulfil the vows we have made and offer incense to the Queen of Heaven and pour libations in her honour. Very well, keep your vows, perform them punctiliously! But listen to the word of Yahweh, all you Judaeans living in Egypt: I swear by my great name, Yahweh says, that my name will no longer be uttered by any man of Judah throughout Egypt; no one will say: As Lord  Yahweh lives. No, I am going to keep my eye on them for disaster, not for prosperity, and all the Judaeans in Egypt will perish either by the sword or by famine until they are wiped out. Yet, though few in number, those who escape the sword will return to the country of Judah from Egypt. Then the entire remnant of Judah which has come and settled in Egypt will know whose word comes true, mine or theirs.</p>

<p>‘And here is the sign for you, Yahweh declares, that I shall punish you in this place: so that you will know that the words with which I threaten you will come true: Yahweh says this: Look, I shall hand Pharaoh Hophra, king of Egypt, over to his enemies and to those determined to kill him, just as I handed Zedekiah king of Judah over to his enemy Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who was determined to kill him’”.</p>

<h4>A prophecy of comfort for Baruch (45:1–5)</h4>

<p>The word that the prophet Jeremiah addressed to Baruch son of Neriah when the latter wrote these words down in a book at Jeremiah’s dictation in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, “This is what Yahweh God of Israel says about you, Baruch! ‘You have been thinking: what disaster for me, and Yahweh has added further grief to my troubles! I am worn out with groaning, and find no relief!’. Say to him as follows, ‘Yahweh says this: Now I am knocking down what I have built, am uprooting what I have planted, over the whole country! And you ask for special treatment! Do not ask, for I am now going to bring disaster on all humanity, Yahweh declares, but you I shall allow to escape with your life, wherever you may go’”.</p>

<p>The cries of Heshbon and Elealeh can be heard as far as Jahaz. The shrieks resound from Zoar to Horonaim and Eglath-Shelishiyah, for even the Waters of Nimrim have become a wasteland.</p>

<p>And in Moab I shall make an end, Yahweh declares, of anyone offering sacrifice on the high places and anyone offering incense to his gods.</p>

<p>That is why my heart sobs like a flute for Moab, sobs like a flute for the people of Kir-Heres, since the wealth he had acquired is lost. Yes, every head is shaved, every beard cut off, gashes are on every hand, sackcloth around every waist. On all the housetops of Moab and in all its squares there is nothing but lamenting, for I have broken Moab like an unwanted pot, Yahweh declares. How shattered he is! Wail! Moab so shamefully in retreat! Moab has become a laughing-stock, a thing of horror to all his neighbours.</p>

<h4>The written prophecy thrown into the Euphrates (51:59–64)</h4>

<p>This is the order that the prophet Jeremiah gave to Seraiah son of Neriah, son of Mahseiah when Seraiah left for Babylon with Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year of his reign. Seraiah was lord chamberlain. Now, on one sheet, Jeremiah had written down the entire disaster that was to befall Babylon, that is, all these words recorded here against Babylon. Jeremiah then said to Seraiah, “When you reach Babylon, see to it that you read all these words aloud. Then say, ‘You, Yahweh, have promised to destroy this place, so that no one will live here ever again, neither human nor animal, and it will be desolate for ever’. Then, when you have finished reading this sheet, tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates, with the words, ‘So shall Babylon sink, never to rise again from the disaster which I am going to bring on her’”.
</p>

<p>Thus far the words of Jeremiah.</p>

<h2 id="vi">VI: Appendix (52:1–34)</h2>

<h4>The destruction of Jerusalem and the pardon of Jehoiachin (52:1–34)</h4>

<p>Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he came to the throne, and he reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamital daughter of Jeremiah, of Libnah. He did what is displeasing to Yahweh, just as Jehoiakim had done. That this should happen to Jerusalem and Judah was due to Yahweh’s anger, resulting in his casting them away from his presence. Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.</p>

<p>In the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon advanced on Jerusalem with his entire army; he pitched camp in front of the city and threw up earthworks around it. The city lay under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah. In the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, when famine was raging in the city and there was no food for the populace, a breach was made in the city wall. The king and all the fighting men then fled, leaving the city under cover of dark, by way of the gate between the two walls, which is near the king’s garden — the Chaldaeans had surrounded the city — and made his way towards the Arabah. The Chaldaean troops pursued the king and caught up with Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, where all his troops deserted. But the Chaldaeans captured the king and took him to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the territory of Hamath, where he passed sentence on him. He had Zedekiah’s sons slaughtered before his eyes; he also had all the chief men of Judah put to death at Riblah. He then put out Zedekiah’s eyes and, loading him with chains, the king of Babylon carried him off to Babylon where he kept him prisoner until his dying day.</p>

<p>In the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month — it was in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon — Nebuzaradan commander of the guard, a member of the king of Babylon’s staff, entered Jerusalem. He burnt down the Temple of Yahweh, the royal palace and all the houses in Jerusalem. The Chaldaean troops who accompanied the commander of the guard demolished all the walls surrounding Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Nebuzaradan commander of the guard deported (some of the poor people and) the remainder of the population left in the city, the deserters who had gone over to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the artisans. But Nebuzaradan commander of the guard left some of the poor country-people behind as vineyard workers and ploughmen.</p>

<p>The Chaldaeans broke up the bronze pillars from the Temple of Yahweh, the wheeled stands and the bronze Sea, which were in the Temple of Yahweh, and took all the bronze away to Babylon. They also took the ash containers, the scoops, the knives, the sprinkling bowls, the incense bowls, and all the bronze furnishings used in worship. The commander of the guard also took the bowls, the censers, the sprinkling bowls, the ash containers, the lamp-stands, the goblets and the saucers: everything that was made of gold and everything made of silver. As regards the two pillars, the one Sea, the twelve bronze oxen supporting the Sea, and the wheeled stands, which King Solomon had made for the Temple of Yahweh, there was no reckoning the weight of bronze in all these objects. As regards the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits, its circumference was twelve cubits, it was four fingers thick, and hollow inside; on it stood a capital of bronze, the height of the capital being five cubits; around the capital were filigree and pomegranates, all in bronze. So also for the second pillar. There were ninety-six pomegranates around the sides, making a hundred pomegranates around the filigree in all.</p>

<p>The commander of the guard took prisoner Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest next in rank, and the three guardians of the threshold. In the city he took prisoner an official who was in command of the fighting men, seven of the king’s personal friends who were discovered in the city, the secretary to the army commander responsible for military conscription, and sixty men of distinction discovered in the city. Nebuzaradan commander of the guard took these men and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah, and at Riblah, in the territory of Hamath, the king of Babylon had them put to death. Thus Judah was deported from its country.</p>

<p>The number of people deported by Nebuchadnezzar was as follows. In the seventh year: three thousand and twenty-three Judaeans; in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar, eight hundred and thirty-two persons were deported from Jerusalem; in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan commander of the guard deported seven hundred and forty-five Judaeans. In all: four thousand six hundred persons.</p>

<p>But in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth day of the month, Evil-Merodach king of Babylon, in the year he came to the throne, pardoned Jehoiachin king of Judah and released him from prison. He treated him kindly and allotted him a seat above those of the other kings who were with him in Babylon. So Jehoiachin laid aside his prisoner’s garb and for the rest of his life always ate at the king’s table. And his upkeep was permanently ensured by the king, day after day, for the rest of his life until the day he died.</p>
