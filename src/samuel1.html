<h3 id="ia">A: The Childhood of Samuel (1:1–4:1a)</h3>

<h4>The pilgrimage to Shiloh (1:1–8)</h4>

<p>There was a man of Ramathaim, a Zuphite from the highlands of Ephraim whose name was Elkanah son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. He had two wives, one called Hannah, the other Peninnah; Peninnah had children but Hannah had none. Every year this man used to go up from his town to worship, and to sacrifice to Yahweh Sabaoth at Shiloh. (The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there as priests of Yahweh.) </p>

<p>One day Elkanah offered a sacrifice. Now he used to give portions to Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters; to Hannah, however, he would give only one portion: for, although he loved Hannah more, Yahweh had made her barren. Furthermore, her rival would taunt and provoke her, because Yahweh had made her womb barren. And this went on year after year; every time they went up to the temple of Yahweh she used to taunt her. On that day she wept and would not eat anything; so her husband Elkanah said, “Hannah, why are you crying? Why are you not eating anything? Why are you so sad? Am I not more to you than ten sons?”. </p>

<h4>Prayer of Hannah (1:9–18)</h4>

<p>When they had finished eating in the room, Hannah got up and stood before Yahweh. Eli the priest was sitting on his seat by the doorpost of the temple of Yahweh. In the bitterness of her soul she prayed to Yahweh with many tears, and she made this vow, “Yahweh Sabaoth! Should you condescend to notice the humiliation of your servant and keep her in mind instead of disregarding your servant, and give her a boy, I will give him to Yahweh for the whole of his life and no razor shall ever touch his head”. </p>

<p>While she went on praying to Yahweh, Eli was watching her mouth, for Hannah was speaking under her breath; her lips were moving but her voice could not be heard, and Eli thought that she was drunk. Eli said, “How much longer are you going to stay drunk? Get rid of your wine”. </p>

<p>“No, my lord”, Hannah replied, “I am a woman in great trouble; I have not been drinking wine or strong drink — I am pouring out my soul before Yahweh. Do not take your servant for a worthless woman; all this time I have been speaking from the depth of my grief and my resentment”. </p>

<p>Eli then replied, “Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant what you have asked of him”. </p>

<p>To which she said, “May your servant find favour in your sight”. With that, the woman went away; she began eating and was dejected no longer. </p>

<h4>Birth and consecration of Samuel (1:19–28)</h4>

<p>They got up early in the morning and, after worshipping Yahweh, set out and went home to Ramah. Elkanah lay with his wife Hannah, and Yahweh remembered her. Hannah conceived and, in due course, gave birth to a son, whom she named Samuel, “since”, she said, “I asked Yahweh for him”. Elkanah, the husband, went up with all his family to offer the annual sacrifice to Yahweh and to fulfil his vow. However, Hannah did not go up, having said to her husband, “Not before the child has been weaned. Then I shall bring him and present him before Yahweh and he will stay there for ever”. </p>

<p>Elkanah her husband then said to her, “Do what you think fit; wait until you have weaned him. May Yahweh bring about what he has said”. So the woman stayed behind and nursed her child until she weaned him. </p>

<p>When she had weaned him, she took him up with her, as well as a three-year-old bull, an <i>ephah</i> of flour and a skin of wine, and took him into the temple of Yahweh at Shiloh; the child was very young. They sacrificed the bull and led the child to Eli. She said, “If you please, my lord! As you live, my lord, I am the woman who stood beside you here, praying to Yahweh. This is the child for which I was praying, and Yahweh has granted me what I asked of him. Now I make him over to Yahweh for the whole of his life. He is made over to Yahweh”. They then worshipped Yahweh there. </p>
<hr />
ISa 2:1 Hannah then prayed as follows: My heart exults in Yahweh, in my God is my strength lifted up, my
mouth derides my foes, for I rejoice in your deliverance.

ISa 2:2 There is no Holy One like Yahweh, (indeed, there is none but you) no Rock like our God.

ISa 2:3 Do not keep talking so proudly, let no arrogance come from your mouth, for Yahweh is a wise God, his
to weigh up deeds.

ISa 2:4 The bow of the mighty has been broken but those who were tottering are now braced with strength.

1 Sa 2:5 The full fed are hiring themselves out for bread but the hungry need labour no more; the barren woman
bears sevenfold but the mother of many is left desolate.

ISa 2:6 Yahweh gives death and life, brings down to Sheol and draws up;

ISa 2:7 Yahweh makes poor and rich, he humbles and also exalts.

1 Sa 2:8 He raises the poor from the dust, he lifts the needy from the dunghill to give them a place with princes,
to assign them a seat of honour; for to Yahweh belong the pillars of the earth, on these he has poised the world.
ISa 2:9 He safeguards the steps of his faithful but the wicked vanish in darkness (for human strength can win
no victories).

ISa 2:10 Yahweh, his enemies are shattered, the Most High thunders in the heavens. Yahweh judges the ends
of the earth, he endows his king with power, he raises up the strength of his Anointed.

ISa 2:1 1 Elkanah then went home to Ramah, but the child stayed in Yahweh’s service, in the presence of Eli
the priest.

ISa 2:12 Now the sons of Eli were scoundrels; they cared nothing for Yahweh

ISa 2:13 nor for what was due to the priests from the people. Whenever anyone offered a sacrifice, the priest’s
servant would come with a three-pronged fork in his hand while the meat was being cooked;

ISa 2:14 he would thrust this into cauldron or pan, or dish or pot, and the priest claimed for his own whatever
the fork brought up. That was how they behaved with all the Israelites who came there to Shiloh.

ISa 2:15 The priest’s servant would even come up before the fat had been burnt and say to the person who
was making the sacrifice, “Give the priest some meat for him to roast. He will not accept boiled meat from you,
only raw”.

ISa 2:16 Then, if the person replied, “Let the fat be burnt first, and then take for yourself whatever you choose”,
he would retort, “No! You must give it to me now or I shall take it by force”.

ISa 2:17 The young men’s sin was very great in Yahweh’s eyes, because they treated with contempt the
offering made to Yahweh.

ISa 2:18 Samuel was in Yahweh’s service, a child wearing a linen loincloth.

ISa 2:19 His mother used to make him a little coat which she brought him each year when she came up with
her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.

ISa 2:20 Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife and say, “May Yahweh grant you an heir by this woman in
exchange for the one which she has made over to Yahweh”, and they would go home.

ISa 2:21 Yahweh visited Hannah; she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile,
the child Samuel grew up in Yahweh’s presence.

ISa 2:22 Although very old, Eli heard about everything that his sons were doing to all Israel,

ISa 2:23 and said, “Why are you behaving as all the people say you are?

ISa 2:24 No, my sons, what I hear reported by the people of Yahweh is not good.

1 Sa 2:25 If one person sins against another, God will be the arbiter, but if he sins against Yahweh, who will
intercede for him?”. But they did not listen to their father’s words, for Yahweh was bent on killing them.

ISa 2:26 Meanwhile, the child Samuel went on growing in stature and in favour both with Yahweh and with
people.

1 Sa 2:27 A man of God came to Eli and said to him, “This is what Yahweh says, ‘Did I not reveal myself to your
father’s family when they were in Egypt as slaves in Pharaoh’s household?

1 Sa 2:28 Did I not single him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn the
offering, to carry the ephod in my presence; and did I not grant all the burnt offerings made by the Israelites to
your father’s family?

ISa 2:29 Why do you trample on the offering and on the sacrifice which I have ordered for my Dwelling, and
honour your sons more than me, by growing fat on the best of the offerings of Israel, my people?

1 Sa 2:30 Whereäs — this is what Yahweh, God of Israel, declares — 1 had promised that your family and your
father’s family would walk in my presence for ever, now, however — this is what Yahweh declares — nothing of
the sort! Those who honour me I honour in my turn, and those who despise me will be an object of contempt.

1 Sa 2:31 Be sure, the days are coming when I shall cut off your strength and the strength of your father’s family,
so that no one in your family will live to old age.

1 Sa 2:32 Beside the Dwelling, you will see all the benefits that I shall confer on Israel, but no one in your family



will ever live to old age.

1 Sa 2:33 I shall keep one of you at my altar for his eyes to go blind and his soul to wither, but the bulk of your
family will die by the sword.

1 Sa 2:34 “‘What happens to your two sons Hophni and Phinehas will be a sign for you: on the same day both
will die.

ISa 2:35 I shall raise myself a faithful priest, who will do as I intend and as I desire. I shall build him an enduring
House and he will walk in the presence of my Anointed for ever.

1 Sa 2:36 The members of your House who survive will come and beg him on their knees for a silver coin and a
loaf of bread and say: Please give me some priestly work, so that I can have a scrap of bread to eat’”.

ISa 3:1 Now, the boy Samuel was serving Yahweh in the presence of Eli; in those days it was rare for Yahweh
to speak; visions were uncommon.

ISa 3:2 One day, it happened that Eli was lying down in his room. His eyes were beginning to grow dim; he
could no longer see.

ISa 3:3 The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying in Yahweh’s sanctuary, where the ark of
God was,

ISa 3:4 when Yahweh called, “Samuel! Samuel!”. He answered, “Here I am”,

ISa 3:5 and, running to Eli, he said, “Here I am, as you called me”. Eli said, “I did not call. Go back and lie down”.
So he went and lay down.

ISa 3:6 And again Yahweh called, “Samuel! Samuel!”. He got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, as you
called me”. He replied, “I did not call, my son; go back and lie down”.

ISa 3:7 As yet, Samuel had no knowledge of Yahweh and the word of Yahweh had not yet been revealed to
him.

1 Sa 3:8 Again Yahweh called, the third time. He got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, as you called me”.
Eli then understood that Yahweh was calling the child,

1 Sa 3:9 and he said to Samuel, “Go and lie down, and if someöne calls say, ‘Speak, Yahweh; for your servant is
listening’”. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.

ISa 3:10 Yahweh then came and stood by, calling as he had done before, “Samuel! Samuel!”. Samuel
answered, “Speak, Yahweh; for your servant is listening”.

ISa 3:1 1 Yahweh then said to Samuel, “I am going to do something in Israel which will make the ears of all who
hear of it ring.

ISa 3:12 I shall carry out that day against Eli everything that I have said about his family, from beginning to end.
ISa 3:13 You are to tell him that I condemn his family for ever, since he is aware that his sons have been
cursing God and yet has not corrected them.

ISa 3:14 Therefore — 1 swear it to the family of Eli — no sacrifice or offering shall ever expiate the guilt of Eli’s
family”.

ISa 3:15 Samuel lay where he was until morning and then opened the doors of Yahweh’s temple. Samuel was
afraid to tell Eli about the vision,

ISa 3:16 but Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son”. “Here I am”, he replied.

ISa 3:17 Eli asked, “What message did he give you? Please do not hide it from me. May God bring unnameable
ills on you and worse ones, too, if you hide from me anything of what he said to you”.

ISa 3:18 Samuel then told him everything, hiding nothing from him. Eli said, “He is Yahweh; let him do what he
thinks good”.

ISa 3:19 Samuel grew up. Yahweh was with him and did not let a single word fall to the ground of all that he
had told him.

ISa 3:20 All Israel knew, from Dan to Beersheba, that Samuel was attested as a prophet of Yahweh.

ISa 3:21 Yahweh continued to manifest himself at Shiloh, revealing himself to Samuel there,

ISa 4:1 and, for all Israel, the word of Samuel was as the word of Yahweh; since Eli was very old and his sons
persisted in their wicked behaviour towards Yahweh. 

It happened at that time that the Philistines mustered to
make war on Israel and Israel went out to meet them in war, pitching camp near Ebenezer while the Philistines
pitched camp at Aphek.

ISa 4:2 The Philistines drew up their battle-line against Israel, the fighting was fierce, and Israel was beaten by
the Philistines: about four thousand men in their ranks were killed on the field of battle.

ISa 4:3 When the troops returned to camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why has Yahweh caused us to be beaten
by the Philistines today? Let us fetch the ark of our God from Shiloh so that, when it goes with us, it may save us
from the clutches of our enemies”.

1 Sa 4:4 So the troops sent to Shiloh and brought away the ark of Yahweh Sabaoth enthroned on the winged
creatures; the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, came with the ark.

1 Sa 4:5 When the ark of Yahweh arrived in the camp, all Israel raised a great war cry so that the earth
resounded.



ISa 4:6 When the Philistines heard the noise of the war cry, they said, “What can this great war cry in the
Hebrew camp mean?”. And they realised that the ark of Yahweh had come into the camp.

1 Sa 4:7 At this, the Philistines were afraid; for they said, “God has come into the camp. Disaster!”. they said. “For
nothing like this has ever happened before.

ISa 4:8 Disaster! Who will rescue us from the clutches of this mighty God? This was the God who struck down
Egypt with every kind of misfortune in the desert.

ISa 4:9 But take courage and be men, Philistines, or you will become slaves to the Hebrews as they have been
slaves to you. Be men and fight”.

ISa 4:10 So the Philistines gave battle and Israel was defeated, each man fleeing to his tent. The slaughter was
very great: on the Israelite side, thirty thousand foot soldiers fell.

ISa 4:1 1 The ark of God was captured too, and Hophni and Phinehas the two sons of Eli died.

ISa 4:12 A Benjaminite ran from the battle-line and reached Shiloh the same day, his clothes torn and dust on
his head.

ISa 4:13 When he arrived, Eli was sitting on his seat beside the gate watching the road, for his heart was
trembling for the ark of God. The man came into the town and told the news, whereüpon cries of anguish filled
the town.

ISa 4:14 Eli heard the sound and asked, “What does this uproar mean?”. The man hurried on and told Eli.

ISa 4:15 Eli was ninety-eight years old; his gaze was fixed; he was blind.

ISa 4:16 The man said to Eli, “I have come from the camp. I escaped from the battle-line today”. “My son”, said
Eli, “what happened?”.

ISa 4:17 The messenger replied, “Israel has fled before the Philistines; the army has been utterly routed. What
is worse, your two sons are dead and the ark of God has been captured”.

ISa 4:18 When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell backwards off his seat by the gate and broke his neck and
died, for he was old and heavy. He had been judge of Israel for forty years.

ISa 4:19 Now his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was with child and near her time. When she heard the
news that the ark of God had been captured and that her father-in-law and husband were dead she crouched
down and gave birth, for her labour pains had come on.

ISa 4:20 When she was at the point of death, the women at her side said, “Do not be afraid; you have given
birth to a son”. But she did not answer and took no notice.

ISa 4:21 She named the child Ichabod, saying, “The glory has gone from Israel”, alluding to the capture of the
ark of God and to her father-in-law and husband.

ISa 4:22 She said, “The glory has gone from Israel, because the ark of God has been captured”.

ISa 5:1 When the Philistines had captured the ark of God, they took it from Ebenezerto Ashdod.

ISa 5:2 Taking the ark of God, the Philistines put it in the temple of Dagon, setting it down beside Dagon.

1 Sa 5:3 When the people of Ashdod got up the following morning and went to the temple of Dagon, there lay
Dagon face down on the ground before the ark of Yahweh. They picked Dagon up and put him back in his place.
ISa 5:4 But when they got up on the following morning, there lay Dagon face down on the ground before the ark
of Yahweh, and Dagon’s head and two hands lay severed on the threshold; only the trunk of Dagon was left in
its place.

ISa 5:5 This is why the priests of Dagon and the people frequenting Dagon’s temple never step on Dagon’s
threshold in Ashdod, even today.

ISa 5:6 Yahweh oppressed the people of Ashdod; he ravaged them and afflicted them with tumours — Ashdod
and its territory. When the people of Ashdod saw what was happening they said,

ISa 5:7 “The ark of the God of Israel must not stay here with us, for he is oppressing us and our god Dagon”.

ISa 5:8 So they summoned all the Philistine chiefs to them, and said, “What shall we do with the ark of the God
of Israel?”. They decided, “The ark of the God of Israel shall be taken away to Gath”. So they took the ark of the
God of Israel to Gath.

ISa 5:9 But after they had taken it there, Yahweh oppressed that town and a great panic broke out; afflicting the
people of the town from highest to lowest, he brought them out in tumours too.

ISa 5:10 They then sent the ark of God to Ekron, but when it came to Ekron the Ekronites shouted, “They have
brought me the ark of the God of Israel to kill me and my people!”.

ISa 5:1 1 They summoned all the Philistine chiefs and said, “Send the ark of the God of Israel away; let it go
back to where it belongs and not kill me and my people” — for there was mortal panic throughout the town; God
was oppressing them.

ISa 5:12 The people who did not die were afflicted with tumours, and the wailing from the town rose to the sky.
ISa 6:1 The ark of Yahweh was in Philistine territory for seven months.

1 Sa 6:2 The Philistines then called for their priests and diviners and asked, “What shall we do with the ark of
Yahweh? Tell us how to send it back to where it belongs”.

ISa 6:3 They replied, “If you send the ark of the God of Israel away, you must certainly not send it away without



a gift; you must pay him a guilt offering. You will then recover and will realise why he continually oppressed you”.
ISa 6:4 They then asked, “What guilt offering ought we to pay him?”. They replied, “Corresponding to the number
of Philistine chiefs: five golden tumours and five golden rats, since the same plague afflicted your chiefs as the
rest of you.

1 Sa 6:5 So make models of your tumours and models of your rats ravaging the territory, and pay honour to the
God of Israel. Then perhaps he will stop oppressing you, your gods and your country.

ISa 6:6 Why should you be as stubborn as Egypt and Pharaoh were? After he had brought disasters on them,
did they not let the people leave?

ISa 6:7 Now, then, take and fit out a new cart, and two milch cows that have never borne the yoke. Then
harness the cows to the cart and take their calves back to the byre.

1 Sa 6:8 Then take the ark of Yahweh, place it on the cart, and put the golden objects which you are paying him
as guilt offering in a box beside it; and then send it off on its own.

ISa 6:9 Watch it; if it goes up the road to its own territory, towards Beth-Shemesh, then he was responsible for
this great harm to us; but if not, we shall know that it was not his hand that struck us, and that this has happened
to us by chance”.

ISa 6:10 The people did this. They took two milch cows and harnessed them to the cart, shutting their calves in
the byre.

ISa 6:1 1 They then put the ark of Yahweh on the cart, with the box and the golden rats and the models of their
tumours.

ISa 6:12 The cows made straight for Beth-Shemesh, keeping to the one road, lowing as they went and turning
neither to right nor to left. The Philistine chiefs followed them as far as the boundaries of Beth-Shemesh.

ISa 6:13 The people of Beth-Shemesh were reaping the wheat harvest in the plain when they looked up and
saw the ark and went joyfully to meet it.

ISa 6:14 When the cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth-Shemesh, it stopped. There was a large stone
there, and they cut up the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to Yahweh.

ISa 6:15 The Levites had taken down the ark of Yahweh and the box with it containing the golden objects and
put these on the large stone. That day the people of Beth-Shemesh presented burnt offerings and made
sacrifices to Yahweh.

ISa 6:16 The five chiefs of the Philistines, having witnessed this, went back to Ekron the same day.

ISa 6:17 The golden tumours paid by the Philistines as a guilt offering to Yahweh were as follows: one for
Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, one for Ekron;

ISa 6:18 and golden rats to the number of all the Philistine towns, those of the five chiefs, from fortified towns
down to open villages: still to this day the large stone in the field of Joshua of Beth-Shemesh, on which they put
the ark of Yahweh, is a witness.

ISa 6:19 Of the people of Beth-Shemesh the sons of Jeconiah had not rejoiced when they saw the ark of
Yahweh, and Yahweh struck down seventy of them. The people mourned because Yahweh had struck them so
fiercely.

ISa 6:20 The people of Beth-Shemesh then said, “Who can stand his ground before Yahweh, this holy God? To
whom shall he go, so that we are rid of him?”.

ISa 6:21 So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-Jearim, to say, “The Philistines have sent back
the ark of Yahweh; come down and take it up to your town”.

ISa 7:1 The men of Kiriath-Jearim came and, taking up the ark of Yahweh, brought it to the house of Abinadab
on the hill, and consecrated his son Eleazar to guard the ark of Yahweh.

ISa 7:2 From the day when the ark was installed at Kiriath-Jearim, a long time went by — twenty years — and
the whole House of Israel longed for Yahweh.

ISa 7:3 Samuel then spoke as follows to the whole House of Israel, “If you are returning to Yahweh with all your
heart, banish the foreign gods and Astartes which you now have, and set your heart on Yahweh and serve him
alone; and he will deliver you from the power of the Philistines”.

ISa 7:4 And the Israelites banished the Baals and Astartes and served Yahweh alone.

ISa 7:5 Samuel then said, “Muster all Israel at Mizpah and I shall plead with Yahweh for you”.

ISa 7:6 So they mustered at Mizpah and drew water and poured it out before Yahweh. They fasted that day
and declared, “We have sinned against Yahweh. 1 And Samuel was judge over the Israelites at Mizpah.

ISa 7:7 When the Philistines heard that the Israelites had mustered at Mizpah, the Philistine chiefs marched on
Israel; and when the Israelites heard this, they were afraid of the Philistines.

ISa 7:8 They said to Samuel, “Do not stop calling on Yahweh our God to rescue us from the power of the
Philistines”.

ISa 7:9 Samuel took a sucking lamb and presented it as a burnt offering to Yahweh, and he called on Yahweh
on behalf of Israel and Yahweh heard him.

ISa 7:10 While Samuel was in the act of presenting burnt offering, the Philistines joined battle with Israel, but



that day Yahweh thundered violently over the Philistines, threw them into panic and Israel defeated them.

ISa 7:1 1 The men of Israel sallied out from Mizpah in pursuit of the Philistines and beat them all the way to
below Beth-Car.

ISa 7:12 Samuel then took a stone and erected it between Mizpah and the Tooth, and gave it the name
Ebenezer, saying, “Yahweh helped us as far as this”.

ISa 7:13 So the Philistines were humbled and no longer came into Israelite territory; Yahweh oppressed the
Philistines throughout the life of Samuel.

ISa 7:14 The towns which the Philistines had taken from Israel were given back to Israel, from Ekron all the
way to Gath, and Israel freed their territory from the power of the Philistines. There was peace, too, between
Israel and the Amorites.

ISa 7:15 Samuel was judge over Israel throughout his life.

ISa 7:16 Each year he went on circuit through Bethel and Gilgal and Mizpah and judged Israel in all these
places.

ISa 7:17 He would then return to Ramah, since his home was there; there too he judged Israel. And there he
built an altar to Yahweh.

ISa 8:1 When Samuel grew old, he appointed his sons as judges of Israel.

1 Sa 8:2 His eldest son was called Joel and his second one, Abijah; they were judges at Beersheba.

1 Sa 8:3 His sons did not follow his example but, seduced by the love of money, took bribes and gave biased
verdicts.

ISa 8:4 The elders of Israel all assembled, went back to Samuel at Ramah, and said,

1 Sa 8:5 “Look, you are old, and your sons are not following your example. So give us a king to judge us, like the
other nations”.

1 Sa 8:6 Samuel thought that it was wrong of them to say, “Let us have a king to judge us”, so he prayed to
Yahweh.

ISa 8:7 But Yahweh said to Samuel, “Obey the voice of the people in all that they say to you: it is not you they
have rejected

1 Sa 8:8 but me, not wishing me to reign over them any more. They are now doing to you exactly what they have
done to me since the day I brought them out of Egypt until now, deserting me and serving other gods.

1 Sa 8:9 So, do what they ask; only, you must give them a solemn warning, and must tell them what the king
who is to reign over them will do”.

ISa 8:10 Everything that Yahweh had said, Samuel then repeated to the people who were asking him for a
king.

ISa 8:1 1 He said, “This is what the king who is to reign over you will do. He will take your sons and direct them
to his chariotry and cavalry, and they will run in front of his chariot.

ISa 8:12 He will use them as leaders of a thousand and leaders of fifty; he will make them plough his fields and
gather in his harvest and make his weapons of war and the gear for his chariots.

ISa 8:13 He will take your daughters as perfumers, cooks and bakers.

ISa 8:14 He will take the best of your fields, your vineyards and your olive groves and give them to his officials.
ISa 8:15 He will tithe your crops and vineyards to provide for his courtiers and his officials.

ISa 8:16 He will take the best of your servants, men and women, of your oxen and your donkeys, and make
them work for him.

ISa 8:17 He will tithe your flocks, and you yourselves will become his slaves.

ISa 8:18 When that day comes, you will cry aloud because of the king you have chosen for yourselves, but on
that day Yahweh will not hear you”.

ISa 8:19 The people, however, refused to listen to Samuel. They said, “No! We are determined to have a king,

1 Sa 8:20 so that we can be like the other nations, with our own king to rule us and lead us and fight our battles”.
ISa 8:21 Samuel listened to all that the people had to say and repeated it in Yahweh’s ear.

ISa 8:22 Yahweh then said to Samuel, “Do as they ask and give them a king”. Samuel then said to the
Israelites, “Go home, each of you, to his own town”.

ISa 9:1 Among the men of Benjamin was a man called Kish son of Abiel, son of Zeror, son of Becorath, son of
Aphiah; a Benjaminite and a person of rank.

1 Sa 9:2 He had a son called Saul, a handsome man in the prime of life. Of all the Israelites there was no one
more handsome than he; he stood head and shoulders taller than anyone else.

ISa 9:3 Now since the donkeys belonging to Kish, Saul’s father, had strayed, Kish said to his son Saul, “My son,
take one of the servants with you and be off; go and look for the donkeys”.

1 Sa 9:4 They went through the highlands of Ephraim, they went through the territory of Shalishah, and did not
find them; they went through the territory of Shaalim but they were not there; they went through the territory of
Benjamin and did not find them.

ISa 9:5 When they reached the territory of Zuph, Saul said to the servant who was with him, “Come on, let us



go back or my father will stop worrying over the donkeys and start being anxious about us”.

ISa 9:6 The servant, however, replied, “Look, there is a man of God in this town, a man who is held in honour;
everything he says comes true. Let us go there, then; perhaps he will be able to show us the way that we should
take”.

1 Sa 9:7 Saul said to his servant, “But if we do go, what can we take to the man? The food in our sacks is
finished, and we have no present to offer the man of God. What else have we got?”.

1 Sa 9:8 The servant spoke up again and said to Saul, “Look, I happen to have a quarter of a silver shekel; I
shall give that to the man of God, for him to tell us which way to go”.

ISa 9:9 In Israel, in olden days, when anyone used to go to consult God, he would say, “Come on, let us go to
the seer”, for a man who is now called a “prophet” used to be called a “seer” in olden days.

ISa 9:10 Saul then said to his servant, “Well said! Come on, let us go”. And they went off to the town where the
man of God was.

ISa 9:1 1 As they were going up the slope to the town they came across some girls going out to draw water, and
said to them, “Is the seer there?”.

ISa 9:12 The girls replied, “He is. He arrived a moment or two ahead of you. You had better hurry: he has just
come to town because the people are having a sacrifice today on the high place.

ISa 9:13 You can catch him as soon as you go into the town, before he goes up to the high place for the meal.
The people will not eat until he comes, since he must bless the sacrifice; after that, the guests will start eating. If
you go up now, you will find him straight away”.

ISa 9:14 So they went up to the town and, as they were going through the gate, Samuel came out towards
them on his way to the high place.

ISa 9:15 Now, Yahweh had given Samuel a revelation the day before Saul came, saying,

ISa 9:16 “About this time tomorrow, I shall send you a man from the territory of Benjamin; you are to anoint him
as prince of my people Israel, and he will save my people from the power of the Philistines; for I have seen the
misery of my people and their cries of anguish have come to me”.

ISa 9:17 When Samuel saw Saul, Yahweh told him, “That is the man of whom I said to you, ‘He is to govern my
people’”.

ISa 9:18 Saul accosted Samuel in the gateway and said, “Tell me, please, where the seer’s house is”.

ISa 9:19 Samuel replied to Saul, “I am the seer. Go up ahead of me to the high place. You must eat with me
today. Tomorrow, when I let you go, I shall tell you whatever is on your mind.

ISa 9:20 As regards your donkeys, however, which strayed three days ago, do not worry about them; they have
been found. And for whom is the whole wealth of Israel destined, if not for you and for all the members of your
father’s family?”.

ISa 9:21 To this, Saul replied, “Am I not a Benjaminite, from the smallest of the tribes of Israel? And is not my
family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why are you saying a thing like this to me?”.

1 Sa 9:22 Samuel then took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall and gave them a place at the
head of the guests, of whom there were about thirty.

ISa 9:23 Samuel then said to the cook, “Serve the portion which I gave you and told you to put on one side”.

ISa 9:24 The cook then picked up the leg and the tail and put it in front of Saul, saying, “This is for you. This is
what was left. Make a good meal . . ”. That day, Saul ate with Samuel.

1 Sa 9:25 They came down from the high place into the town. A bed was made for Saul on the roof and he lay
down there.

ISa 9:26 At dawn, Samuel called to Saul on the roof, “Get up, and I shall send you on your way”. Saul got up,
and Samuel and he went outside together.

1 Sa 9:27 They had walked as far as the end of the town when Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to go on
ahead of us, but you stand still for a moment, so that I can make known to you the word of God”.

ISa 10:1 Samuel took a phial of oil and poured it on Saul’s head; he then kissed him and said, “Has not Yahweh
anointed you as leader of his people Israel? You are the man who is to govern Yahweh’s people and save them
from the power of the enemies surrounding them. The sign for you that Yahweh has anointed you as prince of
his heritage is this:

1 Sa 1 0:2 after leaving me today, you will meet two men near the tomb of Rachel, on the frontier of Benjamin …
and they will say to you, ‘The donkeys which you went looking for have been found, and your father has lost
interest in the matter of the donkeys and is worrying about you and wondering, What am I to do about my son?’.
ISa 10:3 Going on from there, you will come to the Oak of Tabor, where you will meet three men going up to
God at Bethel; one will be carrying three kids, one three loaves of bread and the third a skin of wine.

1 Sa 1 0:4 They will greet you and give you two loaves of bread which you must accept from them.

ISa 10:5 After this, you will come to Gibeah of God (where the Philistine garrison is) and, when you are just
outside the town, you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place, headed by lyre,
tambourine, pipe and harp; they will be in a state of ecstasy.



1 Sa 1 0:6 The spirit of Yahweh will then seize on you, and you will go into ecstasy with them, and be changed
into another man.

ISa 10:7 When these signs have occurred, act as occasion serves, for God is with you.

ISa 10:8 You will then go down, ahead of me, to Gilgal, and I shall join you there to make burnt offerings and to
offer communion sacrifices. You must wait seven days for me to come to you, and I shall then reveal to you what
you must do”.

ISa 10:9 As soon as he had turned his back to leave Samuel, God changed his heart. And all these signs
occurred that very day …

ISa 10:10 From there, they came to Gibeah: and there was a group of prophets coming to meet him! The spirit
of God seized on him and he fell into ecstasy with them.

ISa 10:11 Seeing him prophesying with the prophets, all the people who had known him previously said to one
another, “What has come over the son of Kish? Is Saul one of the prophets too?”.

ISa 10:12 And one of the local people retorted, “But who is their father?”. Hence the origin of the proverb: Is Saul
one of the prophets too?

ISa 10:13 When he came out of his ecstasy, he went into Gibeah.

ISa 10:14 Saul’s uncle asked him and his servant, “Where have you been?”. “Looking for the donkeys”, he
replied, “and when we could not find them anywhere, we went to Samuel”.

ISa 10:15 Saul’s uncle said, “Tell me please what Samuel said to you”.

ISa 10:16 Saul said to his uncle, “He merely told us that the donkeys were already found”, but did not mention
anything that Samuel had said about the kingship.

ISa 10:17 Samuel summoned the people to Yahweh at Mizpah

ISa 10:18 and said to the Israelites, “Yahweh, God of Israel, says this, ‘I brought Israel out of Egypt and
delivered you from the power of the Egyptians and of all the kingdoms that were oppressing you’.

ISa 10:19 But today you have rejected your God, him who saves you from all your difficulties and troubles; and
you have said, ‘No, you must set a king over us’. Very well, take your positions before Yahweh, tribe by tribe
and clan by clan”.

ISa 10:20 Samuel then made all the tribes of Israel come forward, and the lot indicated the tribe of Benjamin.
ISa 10:21 He then made the tribe of Benjamin come forward clan by clan, and the lot indicated the clan of
Matri; he then made the clan of Matri come forward one by one, and the lot indicated Saul son of Kish, but when
they looked for him, he was not to be found.

ISa 10:22 Again they consulted Yahweh, “Has the man come here?”. Yahweh replied, “There he is, hiding
among the baggage”.

ISa 10:23 So they ran and fetched him out and, as he stood among the people, he was head and shoulders
taller than any of them.

ISa 10:24 Samuel then said to all the people, “You have seen the man whom Yahweh has chosen, and that
among the whole people he has no equal”. And all the people acclaimed him, shouting, “Long live the king!”.

ISa 10:25 Samuel then explained the king’s constitutional position to the people and inscribed this in a book
which he placed before Yahweh. Samuel then sent all the people away, everyone back to his home.

ISa 10:26 Saul too went home to Gibeah and with him went those strong men whose hearts God had touched.
ISa 10:27 But there were some scoundrels who said, “How can this fellow save us?”. These treated him with
contempt and offered him no present.

ISa 11:1 About a month later, Nahash the Ammonite marched up and laid siege to Jabesh in Gilead. All the
men of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Make a treaty with us and we will be your subjects”.

ISa 1 1 :2 Nahash the Ammonite replied, “I shall make a treaty with you only on this condition, that I put out all
your right eyes, and I will make it a taunt to the whole of Israel”.

ISa 11:3 The elders of Jabesh said to him, “Give us seven days’ grace while we send messengers throughout
the territory of Israel, and if no one comes to our help, we will come out to you”.

ISa 1 1 :4 The messengers came to Gibeah of Saul, and reported this to the people, and all the people wept
aloud.

ISa 11:5 Now Saul was just then coming in from the fields behind his oxen, and he said, “What is wrong? Why
are the people weeping?”. They explained to him what the men of Jabesh had said.

ISa 11:6 And the spirit of Yahweh seized on Saul when he heard these words, and he fell into a fury.

1 Sa 1 1 :7 He took a yoke of oxen, cut them into pieces and sent these by messengers throughout the territory of
Israel with these words, “Anyone who will not march with Saul will have the same done to his oxen!”. At this, a
panic from Yahweh swept on the people and they marched out as one man.

ISa 11:8 Saul inspected them at Bezek; there were three hundred thousand of Israel and thirty thousand of
Judah.

ISa 11:9 Then he said to the messengers who had come, “This is what you are to say to the people of Jabesh
in Gilead, ‘Tomorrow, by the time that the sun is hot, help will reach you’”. The messengers went and reported



this to the people of Jabesh who were overjoyed;

ISa 11:10 they said to Nahash, Tomorrow we shall come out to you and you can do whatever you like to us”.
ISa 11:11 The next day, Saul disposed the army in three contingents, which burst into the middle of the camp
during the dawn watch and slaughtered the Ammonites until high noon. The survivors were so scattered that no
two of them were left together.

ISa 11:12 The people then said to Samuel, “Who said, ‘Must we have Saul reigning over us?’. Hand the men
over, for us to put them to death”.

ISa 11:13 “No one must be put to death today”, Saul said, “for today Yahweh has intervened to rescue Israel”.
ISa 11:14 Samuel then said to the people, “Let us now go to Gilgal and reaffirm the monarchy there”.

ISa 11:15 The people then all went to Gilgal. And there, at Gilgal, they proclaimed Saul king before Yahweh;
they offered communion sacrifices before Yahweh, and there Saul and all the people of Israel gave themselves
over to great rejoicing.

ISa 12:1 Samuel said to all Israel, “I have faithfully done all that you asked of me, and have appointed you a
king.

ISa 12:2 In future, the king will lead you. As for me, I am old and grey, and in any case you have my sons. I
have been your leader ever since I was young until today.

ISa 12:3 Here I am. Bear witness against me before Yahweh and before his anointed. Whose ox have I taken?
Whose donkey have I taken? Have I wronged or oppressed anyone? Have I taken a consideration from anyone
for looking the other way? If so, I will make amends”.

ISa 12:4 They said, “You have neither wronged nor oppressed us nor accepted anything from anyone”.

1 Sa 1 2:5 He said to them, “Yahweh is your witness and his anointed is witness today that you have found
nothing in my hands?”. They replied, “He is witness”.

ISa 12:6 Samuel then said to the people, “Yahweh is witness, he who raised up Moses and Aaron and who
brought your ancestors out of Egypt.

1 Sa 1 2:7 So now, stay where you are, while I plead with you before Yahweh and remind you of all the saving
acts which he has done for you and for your ancestors.

ISa 12:8 After Jacob had arrived in Egypt, the Egyptians oppressed them, and your ancestors cried to Yahweh.
Yahweh then sent Moses and Aaron, who brought your ancestors out of Egypt and gave them a settled home
here.

ISa 12:9 They then forgot Yahweh their God and he sold them into the power of Sisera, general of the army of
Hazor, and also into the power of the Philistines and of the king of Moab, who made war on them.

ISa 12:10 They cried to Yahweh, ‘We have sinned’, they said, ‘for we have deserted Yahweh and served the
Baals and the Astartes. Rescue us now from the power of our enemies, and we will serve you’.

ISa 12:11 Yahweh then sent Jerubbaal, Barak, Jephthah, and Samuel. He rescued you from the power of the
enemies surrounding you, and you lived in security.

ISa 12:12 “But when you saw Nahash, king of the Ammonites, marching on you, you said to me, ‘No, we must
have a king to rule us’ — although Yahweh your God is your king.

ISa 12:13 So, here is the king whom you have chosen; Yahweh has appointed you a king.

1 Sa 1 2: 1 4 If you fear and serve Yahweh and obey his voice and do not rebel against his commands, and if both
you and the king who rules you follow Yahweh your God, all will be well.

1 Sa 1 2: 1 5 But if you do not obey Yahweh’s voice but rebel against his commands, Yahweh’s hand will be
against you and against your king.

ISa 12:16 “Stay where you are and see the wonder which Yahweh will do before your eyes.

ISa 12:17 Is it not now the wheat harvest? I shall call on Yahweh and he will send thunder and rain, so that you
may clearly understand what a very wicked thing you have done, in Yahweh’s eyes, by asking for a king”.

ISa 12:18 Samuel then called on Yahweh, and Yahweh sent thunder and rain the same day, and all the people
held Yahweh and Samuel in great awe.

ISa 12:19 They all said to Samuel, “Pray for your servants to Yahweh your God, to save us from death; for to all
our sins we have added this wrong of asking for a king”.

ISa 12:20 Samuel said to the people, “Do not be afraid. Although you have done all these wicked things, do not
withdraw your allegiance from Yahweh. Instead, serve Yahweh with all your heart.

ISa 12:21 Do not transfer your allegiance to useless idols which, being useless, are futile and cannot save
anybody;

ISa 12:22 Yahweh, for the sake of his great name, will not desert his people, for it has pleased Yahweh to
make you his people.

ISa 12:23 For my part, far be it from me to sin against Yahweh by ceasing to pray for you or to instruct you in
the good and right way.

ISa 12:24 Fear none but Yahweh, and serve him faithfully with all your heart, bearing in mind the wonder which
he has just performed. But, if you persist in wickedness, you and your king will perish”.



ISa 13:1 Saul was … years old when he became king, and reigned over Israel for … years.

ISa 13:2 Saul selected three thousand men of Israel; two thousand of them were with Saul at Michmash and in
the highlands of Bethel, and one thousand with Jonathan at Geba of Benjamin; the rest of the people Saul sent
home, everyone to his tent.

ISa 13:3 Jonathan killed the Philistine governor stationed at Gibeah and the Philistines were informed that the
Hebrews had risen in revolt. Saul had the trumpet sounded throughout the country,

ISa 13:4 and all Israel heard the news, “Saul has killed the Philistine governor, and now Israel has antagonised
the Philistines”. So all the people rallied behind Saul at Gilgal.

ISa 13:5 The Philistines mustered to make war on Israel, three thousand chariots, six thousand horse and a
force as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They came up and pitched camp at Michmash, to the east of
Beth-Aven.

ISa 13:6 When the Israelites saw that their plight was desperate, being so hard pressed, the people hid in
caves, in holes, in crevices, in vaults, in wells.

ISa 13:7 Some also crossed the Jordan fords into the territory of Gad and Gilead. Saul was still at Gilgal and all
the people who followed him were trembling.

ISa 13:8 He waited for seven days, the period fixed by Samuel, but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the
army, deserting Saul, began dispersing.

ISa 13:9 Saul then said, “Bring me the burnt offering and the communion sacrifices”. And he presented the burnt
offering.

ISa 13:10 Just as he had finished presenting the burnt offering, Samuel arrived, and Saul went out to meet and
greet him.

ISa 13:11 Samuel said, “What have you been doing?”. Saul replied, “I saw the army deserting me and
dispersing, and you had not come at the time fixed, while the Philistines were mustering at Michmash.

ISa 13:12 Sol thought: Now the Philistines are going to fall on me at Gilgal and I have not implored the favour
of Yahweh. So I felt obliged to make the burnt offering myself”.

ISa 13:13 Samuel said to Saul, “You have acted like a fool. You have not obeyed the order which Yahweh your
God gave you. Otherwise, Yahweh would have confirmed your sovereignty over Israel for ever.

ISa 13:14 But now your sovereignty will not last; Yahweh has discovered a man after his own heart and
designated him as leader of his people, since you have not carried out what Yahweh ordered you”.

ISa 13:15 Samuel then got up and left Gilgal to continue his journey. Those people remaining followed Saul as
he went to join the warriors, and went from Gilgal to Geba of Benjamin. Saul reviewed the force that was with
him; there were about six hundred men.

ISa 13:16 Saul, his son Jonathan, and the force that was with them took up their quarters in Geba of Benjamin
while the Philistines camped at Michmash.

ISa 13:17 The raiding company sallied out of the Philistine camp in three groups: one group made for Ophrah
in the territory of Shual;

ISa 13:18 one group made for Beth-Horon; and one group made for the high ground overlooking the Valley of
the Hyenas, in the direction of the desert.

ISa 13:19 There was not a single blacksmith throughout the territory of Israel, the Philistines’ reasoning being,
“We do not want the Hebrews making swords or spears”.

1 Sa 1 3:20 Hence, the Israelites were all in the habit of going down individually to the Philistines to sharpen their
ploughshares, axes, mattocks and scythes.

1 Sa 1 3:21 The price was two-thirds of a shekel for ploughshares and axes, and one-third for sharpening
mattocks and straightening goads.

1 Sa 1 3:22 So it was that on the day of the battle, no one in the army with Saul and Jonathan was equipped with
either sword or spear; only Saul and his son Jonathan were so equipped.

1 Sa 1 3:23 A Philistine unit set out for the Pass of Michmash.

ISa 14:1 One day, Jonathan son of Saul said to his armour-bearer, “Come on, let us go across to the Philistine
outpost over on the other side”. But he did not inform his father.

ISa 14:2 Saul was on the outskirts of Geba, sitting under the pomegranate tree that stands near the threshing-
floor; the force with him numbered about six hundred men.

ISa 14:3 Ahijah son of Ahitub, brother of Ichabod, son of Phinehas, son of Eli, the priest of Yahweh at Shiloh,
was carrying the ephod. The force did not know that Jonathan had left.

ISa 14:4 In the pass that Jonathan was trying to cross to reach the Philistine outpost, there is a rocky spur on
one side and a rocky spur on the other; one is called Bozez, the other Seneh.

ISa 14:5 The first spur stands to the north facing Michmash, the other to the south facing Geba.

ISa 14:6 Jonathan said to his armour-bearer, “Come on, let us go across to these uncircumcised people’s
outpost; perhaps Yahweh will do something for us, for Yahweh is free to grant deliverance through a few men,
just as much as through many”.



ISa 14:7 His armour-bearer replied, “Do exactly as you think. I am with you; our hearts are as one”.

ISa 14:8 Jonathan then said, “Look, we will go across to these people and let ourselves be seen.

ISa 14:9 If they say, ‘Do not move until we come to you’, we shall stay where we are and not go up to them.

1 Sa 1 4: 1 0 But if they say, ‘Come up to us’, we shall go up, for that will be the sign for us that Yahweh has given
them into our power”.

ISa 14:11 When the two of them let themselves be seen by the Philistine outpost, the Philistines said, “Look,
the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have been hiding”.

ISa 14:12 The men of the outpost then hailed Jonathan and his armour-bearer. “Come up to us”, they said, “we
have something to tell you”. Jonathan then said to his armour-bearer, “Follow me up; Yahweh has given them
into the power of Israel”.

ISa 14:13 Jonathan clambered up on hands and feet, with his armour-bearer behind him; the Philistines fell at
Jonathan’s onslaught, and his armour-bearer, coming behind, finished them off.

ISa 14:14 This first killing made by Jonathan and his armour-bearer accounted for about twenty men …

ISa 14:15 There was panic in the camp, in the field and throughout the army; outpost and raiding company too
were panic-stricken; the earth quaked: it was a panic from Yahweh.

ISa 14:16 Saul’s look-out men in Geba of Benjamin could see the camp scattering in all directions.

ISa 14:17 Saul then said to the force that was with him, “Call the roll and see who has left us”. So they called
the roll, and Jonathan and his armour-bearer were missing.

ISa 14:18 Saul then said to Ahijah, “Bring the ephod”, since he was the man who carried the ephod in Israel.

ISa 14:19 But while Saul was speaking to the priest, the turmoil in the Philistine camp grew worse and worse;
and Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand”.

ISa 14:20 Saul and the whole force with him then formed up and advanced to where the fighting was going on:
and there they all were, drawing their swords on one another in wild confusion.

ISa 14:21 Those Hebrews who had earlier taken service with the Philistines and had accompanied them into
camp, now defected to the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.

ISa 14:22 Similarly, all those Israelites who had been hiding in the highlands of Ephraim, hearing that the
Philistines were on the run, chased after them and joined in the fight.

ISa 14:23 That day Yahweh gave Israel the victory. The fighting reached the other side of Beth-Horon.

ISa 14:24 As the men of Israel were hard pressed that day, Saul pronounced this imprecation over the people,
“A curse on anyone who eats food before evening, before I have taken revenge on my enemies!”. So none of the
people so much as tasted food.

ISa 14:25 Now there was a honeycomb out in the open.

ISa 14:26 The people came to the honeycomb, the honey was dripping out, but no one put a hand to his mouth,
the people being in awe of the oath.

ISa 14:27 Jonathan, however, not having heard his father bind the people with the oath, reached with the end
of the stick which he was carrying, thrust it into the honeycomb and put it to his mouth; whereüpon his eyes grew
brighter.

ISa 14:28 One of the people then spoke up. “Your father”, he said, “has bound the people with this oath: ‘A
curse on anyone who eats anything today’”.

ISa 14:29 “My father has brought trouble on the country”, Jonathan replied. “See how much brighter my eyes are
for having eaten this mouthful of honey.

ISa 14:30 By the same token, if the people had been allowed to eat some of the booty which they had captured
from the enemy today, would not the defeat of the Philistines have been all the greater?”.

ISa 14:31 That day the Philistines were beaten from Michmash all the way to Aijalon, until the people were
utterly exhausted.

ISa 14:32 The people flung themselves on the booty and, taking sheep, bullocks and calves, slaughtered them
there on the ground and ate them with the blood.

ISa 14:33 Saul was informed, “The people are sinning against Yahweh by eating with the blood!”. He said, “You
have not kept faith! Roll me a large stone here!”.

ISa 14:34 Saul then said, “Scatter among the people and say, ‘Everyone is to bring his bullock or his sheep to
me here’. You will slaughter them here and eat, and not sin against Yahweh by eating with the blood”. Each
individual brought what he happened to have that night, and they all slaughtered in the same place.

ISa 14:35 Saul built an altar to Yahweh; it was the first altar he had built to Yahweh.

ISa 14:36 Saul said, “Let us go down under cover of dark and plunder the Philistines until dawn; we shall not
leave one of them alive”. “Do whatever you think right”, they replied. But the priest said, “Let us approach God
here”.

ISa 14:37 Saul consulted God, “Shall I go down and pursue the Philistines? Will you hand them over to Israel?”.
But he gave him no reply that day.

ISa 14:38 Saul then said, “Come forward, all you leaders of the people; consider carefully where today’s sin



may lie;

ISa 14:39 for as Yahweh lives who gives victory to Israel, even if the sin lies with Jonathan my son, he shall be
put to death”. But not one out of all the people answered.

ISa 14:40 He then said to all Israel, “Stand on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will stand on the other”. And
the people replied to Saul, “Do as you think right”.

ISa 14:41 Saul then said, “Yahweh, God of Israel, why did you not answer your servant today? Yahweh, God of
Israel, if the fault lies with me or with my son Jonathan, give urim: if the fault lies with your people Israel, give
thummim”. Jonathan and Saul were indicated and the people went free.

ISa 14:42 Saul said, “Cast the lot between me and my son Jonathan”, and Jonathan was indicated.

ISa 14:43 “I only tasted a mouthful of honey off the end of the stick which I was carrying. But I am ready to die”.
ISa 14:44 Saul said, “May God bring unnameable ills on me, and worse ones too, if you do not die, Jonathan!”.
ISa 14:45 But the people said to Saul, “Must Jonathan die after winning this great victory for Israel? We will
never allow that! As Yahweh lives, not one hair of his head shall fall to the ground, for his deeds today have
been done with the help of God”. And so the people ransomed Jonathan and he was not put to death.

ISa 14:46 Saul decided not to pursue the Philistines, and the Philistines retired to their own territory.

ISa 14:47 Saul consolidated his rule over Israel and made war on all his enemies on all fronts: on Moab, the
Ammonites, Edom, the king of Zobah and the Philistines; whichever way he turned, he was victorious.

ISa 14:48 He did great deeds of valour; he defeated the Amalekites and delivered Israel from those who used
to pillage him.

ISa 14:49 Saul’s sons were: Jonathan, Ishvi and Malchishua. The names of his two daughters were: the elder,
Merab, and the younger, Michal.

ISa 1 4:50 The name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of his army commander was
Abner son of Ner, Saul’s uncle.

ISa 14:51 Kish father of Saul, and Ner father of Abner were the sons of Abiel.

ISa 14:52 There was fierce warfare with the Philistines throughout Saul’s life. Any strong or valiant man who
caught Saul’s eye, he recruited into his service.

ISa 15:1 Samuel said to Saul, “I am the man whom Yahweh sent to anoint you as king of his people Israel, so
now listen to the words of Yahweh.

ISa 15:2 This is what Yahweh Sabaoth says, ‘I intend to punish what Amalek did to Israel — laying a trap for
him on the way as he was coming up from Egypt.

ISa 15:3 Now, go and crush Amalek; put him under the curse of destruction with all that he possesses. Do not
spare him, but kill man and woman, babe and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and donkey’”.

ISa 15:4 Saul summoned the people and reviewed them at Telaim: two hundred thousand foot soldiers (and
ten thousand men of Judah).

ISa 15:5 Saul advanced on the town of Amalek and lay in ambush in the river bed.

ISa 15:6 Saul said to the Kenites, “Go away, leave your homes among the Amalekites, in case I destroy you
with them — you acted with faithful love towards all the Israelites when they were coming up from Egypt”. So the
Kenites moved away from the Amalekites.

ISa 15:7 Saul then crushed the Amalekites, beginning at Havilah in the direction of Shur, which is to the east of
Egypt.

ISa 15:8 He took Agag king of the Amalekites alive and, executing the curse of destruction, put all the people to
the sword.

1 Sa 1 5:9 But Saul and the army spared Agag with the best of the sheep and cattle, the fatlings and lambs and
all that was good. They did not want to consign these to the curse of destruction; they consigned only what was
poor and worthless.

ISa 15:10 The word of Yahweh came to Samuel,

ISa 15:11 “I regret having made Saul king, since he has broken his allegiance to me and not carried out my
orders”. Samuel was appalled and cried to Yahweh all night long.

ISa 15:12 In the morning, Samuel set off to find Saul. Samuel was told, “Saul has been to Carmel, to raise
himself a monument there, but now has turned about, moved on and gone down to Gilgal”.

ISa 15:13 When Samuel reached Saul, Saul said, “May you be blessed by Yahweh! I have carried out
Yahweh’s orders”.

ISa 15:14 Samuel replied, “Then what is this bleating of sheep in my ears and the lowing of cattle that I hear?”.
ISa 15:15 Saul said, “They have been brought from Amalek, the people having spared the best of the sheep
and cattle to sacrifice them to Yahweh, your God; the rest we have consigned to the curse of destruction”.

ISa 15:16 Samuel then said to Saul, “Stop! Let me tell you what Yahweh said to me last night”. He said, “Go on”.
ISa 15:17 Samuel said, “Small as you may be in your own eyes, are you not the leader of the tribes of Israel?
Yahweh has anointed you as king of Israel.

ISa 15:18 When Yahweh sent you on a mission he said to you, ‘Go and put those sinners, the Amalekites,



under the curse of destruction and make war on them until they are exterminated’.

ISa 15:19 Why then did you not obey Yahweh’s voice? Why did you fall on the booty and do what is wrong in
Yahweh’s eyes?”.

ISa 15:20 Saul replied to Samuel, “But I did obey Yahweh’s voice. I went on the mission which Yahweh gave
me; I brought back Agag king of the Amalekites; I put Amalek under the curse of destruction;

ISa 15:21 and from the booty the people have taken the best sheep and cattle of what was under the curse of
destruction only to sacrifice them to Yahweh your God in Gilgal”.

ISa 15:22 To which, Samuel said: Is Yahweh pleased by burnt offerings and sacrifices or by obedience to
Yahweh’s voice? Truly, obedience is better than sacrifice, submissiveness than the fat of rams.

1 Sa 1 5:23 Rebellion is a sin of sorcery, presumption a crime of idolatry! “Since you have rejected Yahweh’s
word, he has rejected you as king”.

ISa 15:24 Saul then said to Samuel, “I have sinned, having broken Yahweh’s order and your instructions
because I was afraid of the people and yielded to their demands.

ISa 15:25 Now, please forgive my sin and come back with me, so that I can worship Yahweh”.

ISa 15:26 Samuel said to Saul, “I will not come back with you, since you have rejected Yahweh’s word and
Yahweh has rejected you as king of Israel”.

1 Sa 1 5:27 As Samuel turned away to leave, Saul caught at the hem of his cloak and it tore,

ISa 15:28 and Samuel said to him, “Today Yahweh has torn the kingdom of Israel from you and given it to a
neighbour of yours who is better than you”.

1 Sa 1 5:29 (The Glory of Israel, however, does not lie or go back on his word, not being human and liable to go
back on his word.)

ISa 15:30 “I have sinned”, Saul said, “but please still show me respect in front of my people’s elders and in front
of Israel, and come back with me, so that I can worship Yahweh your God”.

ISa 15:31 Samuel followed Saul back and Saul worshipped Yahweh.

ISa 15:32 Samuel then said, “Bring me Agag king of the Amalekites!”. Agag came towards him unsteadily
saying, “Truly death is bitter!”.

ISa 15:33 Samuel said: As your sword has left women childless, so will your mother be left childless among
women! Samuel then butchered Agag before Yahweh at Gilgal.

ISa 15:34 Samuel left for Ramah, and Saul went up home to Gibeah of Saul.

ISa 15:35 Samuel did not see Saul again till his dying day. Samuel indeed mourned over Saul, but Yahweh
regretted having made Saul king of Israel.

ISa 16:1 Yahweh said to Samuel, “How much longer do you mean to go on mourning over Saul, now that I
myself have rejected him as ruler of Israel? Fill your horn with oil and go. I am sending you to Jesse of
Bethlehem, for I have found myself a king from among his sons”.

ISa 16:2 Samuel replied, “How can I go? When Saul hears of it he will kill me”. Yahweh then said, “Take a heifer
with you and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh’.

1 Sa 1 6:3 Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I shall reveal to you what you must do; and you will anoint for me the
one I indicate to you”.

1 Sa 1 6:4 Samuel did what Yahweh ordered and went to Bethlehem. The elders of the town came trembling to
meet him and asked, “Seer, is your coming favourable for us”,

ISa 16:5 “Yes”, he replied. “I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh. Purify yourselves and come with me to the
sacrifice”. He purified Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.

ISa 16:6 When they arrived, he looked at Eliab and thought, “This must be Yahweh’s anointed now before him”,
ISa 16:7 but Yahweh said to Samuel, “Take no notice of his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him;
God does not see as human beings see; they look at appearances but Yahweh looks at the heart”.

ISa 16:8 Jesse then called Abinadab and presented him to Samuel, who said, “Yahweh has not chosen this one
either”.

ISa 16:9 Jesse then presented Shammah, but Samuel said, “Yahweh has not chosen this one either”.

ISa 16:10 Jesse thus presented seven of his sons to Samuel, but Samuel said to Jesse, “Yahweh has not
chosen these”.

ISa 16:11 He then asked Jesse, “Are these all the sons you have?”. Jesse replied, “There is still one left, the
youngest; he is looking after the sheep”. Samuel then said to Jesse, “Send for him, for we shall not sit down to
eat until he arrives”.

ISa 16:12 Jesse had him sent for; he had ruddy cheeks, with fine eyes and an attractive appearance. Yahweh
said, “Get up and anoint him: he is the one!”.

1 Sa 1 6: 1 3 At this, Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him, surrounded by his brothers; and the spirit of
Yahweh seized on David from that day onwards. Samuel, for his part, set off and went to Ramah.

ISa 16:14 Now the spirit of Yahweh had withdrawn from Saul, and an evil spirit from Yahweh afflicted him with
terrors.



1 Sa 16:15 Saul’s servants said to him, “An evil spirit from God is undoubtedly the cause of your terrors.

ISa 16:16 Let our lord give the order, and your servants who wait on you will look for a skilled harpist; when the
evil spirit from God comes over you, he will play and it will do you good”.

ISa 16:17 Saul said to his attendants, “Find me, please, a man who plays well, and bring him to me”.

ISa 16:18 One of the servants then spoke up and said, “I have seen one of the sons of Jesse the Bethlehemite:
he is a skilled player, a brave man and a fighter, well spoken, good-looking and Yahweh is with him”.

ISa 16:19 So Saul sent messengers to Jesse with the order, “Send me your son David (who is with the sheep)”.

1 Sa 1 6:20 Jesse took five loaves, a skin of wine and a kid, and sent them to Saul by his son David.

ISa 16:21 David went to Saul and entered his service; Saul became very fond of him and David became his
armour-bearer.

ISa 16:22 Saul then sent a message to Jesse, “Let David stay in my service, since he has won my favour”.

1 Sa 1 6:23 And whenever the spirit from God came over Saul, David would take a harp and play; Saul would
then be soothed; it would do him good, and the evil spirit would leave him.

ISa 17:1 The Philistines mustered their troops for war; they assembled at Socoh in Judah and pitched camp
between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-Dammim.

ISa 17:2 Saul and the Israelites also mustered, pitching camp in the Valley of the Terebinth, and drew up their
battle-line opposite the Philistines.

ISa 17:3 The Philistines occupied the high ground on one side and the Israelites occupied the high ground on
the other side, with the valley between them.

ISa 17:4 A champion stepped out from the Philistine ranks; his name was Goliath, from Gath; he was six cubits
and one span tall.

ISa 17:5 On his head was a bronze helmet and he wore a breastplate of scale-armour; the breastplate weighed
five thousand shekels of bronze.

ISa 17:6 He had bronze greaves on his legs and a bronze scimitar slung across his shoulders.

ISa 17:7 The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam, and the head of his spear weighed six hundred
shekels of iron. A shield-bearer walked in front of him.

ISa 17:8 Taking position in front of the Israelite lines, he shouted, “Why have you come out to range yourselves
for battle? Am I not a Philistine and are you not Saul’s lackeys? Choose a man and let him come down to me.
ISa 17:9 If he can fight it out with me and kill me, we will be your servants; but if I can beat him and kill him, you
become our servants and serve us”.

ISa 17:10 The Philistine then said, “I challenge the ranks of Israel today. Give me a man and we will fight it out!”.
ISa 17:11 When Saul and all Israel heard what the Philistine said, they were dismayed and terrified.

ISa 17:12 David was the son of an Ephrathite from Bethlehem of Judah whose name was Jesse; Jesse had
eight sons and, by Saul’s time, he was old and well on in years.

ISa 17:13 Jesse’s eldest three sons followed Saul to the war. The names of the three sons who went to the war
were: the eldest Eliab, the second Abinadab and the third Shammah.

ISa 17:14 David was the youngest; the eldest three followed Saul.

ISa 17:15 David alternated between serving Saul and looking after his father’s sheep at Bethlehem.

ISa 17:16 Morning and evening, the Philistine advanced, presenting himself thus for forty days.

ISa 17:17 Jesse said to his son David, “Take your brothers this <i>ephah</i> of roasted grain and these ten loaves,
and hurry to the camp, to your brothers.

ISa 17:18 And take these ten cheeses to their commanding officer; find out how your brothers are and bring
some token back from them;

ISa 17:19 they are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the Valley of the Terebinth, fighting the Philistines”.

ISa 17:20 David got up early in the morning and, leaving the sheep with someöne to guard them, took up his
load and went off as Jesse had ordered; he reached the encampment just as the troops were leaving to take up
battle stations and shouting the war cry.

ISa 17:21 Israel and the Philistines drew up their lines facing one another.

ISa 17:22 David left his bundle in charge of the baggage guard and, running to the battle-line, went and asked
his brothers how they were.

ISa 17:23 While he was talking to them, the champion (Goliath, the Philistine from Gath) came up from the
Philistine ranks and made his usual speech, which David heard.

ISa 17:24 As soon as the Israelites saw this man, they all ran away from him and were terrified.

ISa 17:25 The Israelites said, “You saw that man who just came up? He comes to challenge Israel. The king will
lavish riches on the man who kills him, he will give him his daughter in marriage and exempt his father’s family
from all taxes in Israel”.

ISa 17:26 David asked the men who were standing near him, “What would be the reward for killing this
Philistine and saving Israel from disgrace? Who is this uncircumcised Philistine, to challenge the armies of the
living God?”.



ISa 17:27 The people told him what they had been saying, That would be the reward for killing him”, they said.
ISa 17:28 His eldest brother Eliab heard David talking to the men and grew angry with him. “Why have you
come down here?”. he said. “Whom have you left in charge of those few sheep in the desert? I know how
impudent and artful you are; you have come to watch the battle!”.

ISa 17:29 David retorted, “What have I done? May I not even speak?”.

ISa 17:30 And he turned away from him to someöne else and asked the same question, to which the people
replied as before.

ISa 17:31 David’s words were noted, however, and reported to Saul, who sent for him.

ISa 17:32 David said to Saul, “Let no one be discouraged on his account; your servant will go and fight this
Philistine”.

ISa 17:33 Saul said to David, “You cannot go and fight the Philistine; you are only a boy and he has been a
warrior since his youth”.

ISa 17:34 David said to Saul, “Your servant used to look after the sheep for his father and whenever a lion or a
bear came and took a sheep from the flock,

ISa 17:35 I used to follow it up, lay into it and snatch the sheep out of its jaws. If it turned on me, I would seize it
by the beard and batter it to death.

ISa 17:36 Your servant has killed both lion and bear, and this uncircumcised Philistine will end up like one of
them for having challenged the armies of the living God”.

ISa 17:37 “Yahweh”, David went on, “who delivered me from the claws of lion and bear, will deliver me from the
clutches of this Philistine”. Then Saul said to David, “Go, and Yahweh be with you!”.

ISa 17:38 Saul dressed David in his own armour; he put a bronze helmet on his head, dressed him in a
breastplate

ISa 17:39 and buckled his own sword over David’s armour. David tried to walk but, not being used to them, said
to Saul, “I cannot walk in these; I am not used to them”. So they took them off again.

ISa 17:40 He took his stick in his hand, selected five smooth stones from the river bed and put them in his
shepherd’s bag, in his pouch; then, sling in hand, he walked towards the Philistine.

ISa 17:41 The Philistine, preceded by his shield-bearer, came nearer and nearer to David.

ISa 17:42 When the Philistine looked David up and down, what he saw filled him with scorn, because David
was only a lad, with ruddy cheeks and an attractive appearance.

ISa 17:43 The Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog for you to come after me with sticks?”. And the Philistine
cursed David by his gods.

ISa 17:44 The Philistine said to David, “Come over here and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and the
wild beasts!”.

ISa 17:45 David retorted to the Philistine, “You come to me with sword, spear and scimitar, but I come to you in
the name of Yahweh Sabaoth, God of the armies of Israel, whom you have challenged.

ISa 17:46 Today, Yahweh will deliver you into my hand; I shall kill you, I shall cut off your head; today, I shall
give your corpse and the corpses of the Philistine army to the birds of the air and the wild beasts, so that the
whole world may know that there is a God in Israel,

ISa 17:47 and this whole assembly know that Yahweh does not give victory by means of sword and spear — for
Yahweh is lord of the battle and he will deliver you into our power”.

ISa 17:48 No sooner had the Philistine started forward to confront David than David darted out of the lines and
ran to meet the Philistine.

ISa 17:49 Putting his hand in his bag, he took out a stone, slung it and struck the Philistine on the forehead; the
stone penetrated his forehead and he fell face downwards on the ground.

ISa 17:50 Thus David triumphed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone; he hit the Philistine and killed him,
though he had no sword in his hand.

ISa 17:51 David ran and stood over the Philistine, seized his sword, pulled it from the scabbard, despatched
him and cut off his head. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.

ISa 17:52 The men of Israel and of Judah started forward, shouting their war cry, and pursued the Philistines as
far as the approaches of Gath and the gates of Ekron. The Philistine dead lay all along the road from Shaaraim
as far as Gath and Ekron.

ISa 17:53 Turning back from their ferocious pursuit of the Philistines, the Israelites plundered their camp.

ISa 17:54 And David took the Philistine’s head and brought it to Jerusalem; his weapons, however, he put in his
own tent.

ISa 17:55 When Saul saw David going to engage the Philistine he said to Abner, the army commander, “Abner,
whose son is that boy?”. “On your life, O king”, Abner replied, “I do not know”.

ISa 17:56 The king said, “Find out whose son the lad is”.

ISa 17:57 When David came back after killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul with
the Philistine’s head in his hand.



ISa 17:58 Saul asked him, “Whose son are you, young man?”. David replied, “The son of your servant Jesse of
Bethlehem”.

ISa 18:1 When David had finished talking to Saul, Jonathan felt an instant affection for David; Jonathan loved
him like his very self;

ISa 18:2 Saul engaged him that very day and would not let him go home to his father.

ISa 18:3 Jonathan made a pact with David, since he loved him like his very self;

1 Sa 1 8:4 Jonathan took off the cloak which he was wearing and gave it to David, and his armour too, even
including his sword, his bow and his belt.

ISa 18:5 Wherever David was sent on a mission by Saul, he was successful, and Saul put him in command of
the fighting men; all the people respected him and so did Saul’s staff.

1 Sa 1 8:6 On their return, when David was coming back from killing the Philistine, the women came out of all the
towns of Israel singing and dancing to meet King Saul, with tambourines, sistrums and cries of joy;

1 Sa 1 8:7 and as they danced the women sang: Saul has killed his thousands, and David his tens of thousands.
ISa 18:8 Saul was very angry; the incident displeased him. “They have given David the tens of thousands”, he
said, “but me only the thousands; what more can he have, except the throne?”.

ISa 18:9 And Saul watched David jealously from that day onwards.

ISa 18:10 The following day, an evil spirit from God seized on Saul and he fell into a frenzy while he was
indoors. David played the harp as on other occasions; Saul had a spear in his hand.

ISa 18:11 Saul brandished the spear; he said, “I will pin David to the wall!”. David evaded him twice.

ISa 18:12 Saul feared David, since Yahweh was with him and had withdrawn from Saul.

ISa 18:13 So Saul removed him from his presence and appointed him commander of a thousand; he led the
people on campaign.

ISa 18:14 In all his expeditions, David was successful and Yahweh was with him.

ISa 18:15 And Saul, seeing how very successful he was, was afraid of him.

ISa 18:16 All Israel and Judah loved David, however, since he was their leader on campaign.

ISa 18:17 Saul said to David, “This is my elder daughter Merab; I shall give her to you in marriage; but you must
serve me bravely and fight Yahweh’s wars”. Saul thought, “Better than strike the blow myself, let the Philistines
do it!”.

ISa 18:18 David replied to Saul, “Who am I and what is my lineage — and my father’s family — in Israel, for me
to become the king’s son-in-law?”.

ISa 18:19 When the time came for Merab daughter of Saul to be given to David, she was given to Adriel of
Meholah instead.

ISa 18:20 Now Michal daughter of Saul fell in love with David. When Saul heard this he was pleased.

1 Sa 1 8:21 He thought, “Yes, I shall give her to him; she can be the snare for him, so that the Philistines will get

him”. (On two occasions, Saul told David, “Today, you shall be my son-in-law.')

ISa 18:22 Saul gave instructions to his servants, “Have a private word with David and say, ‘Look, the king is

fond of you and all his servants love you — why not be the king’s son-in-law?’”.

ISa 18:23 Saul’s servants repeated these words in David’s ear, to which David replied, “Do you think that
becoming the king’s son-in-law is a trivial matter; I have neither wealth nor position”.

ISa 18:24 Saul’s servants then reported back, “This is what David said”.

ISa 18:25 Saul replied, “Tell David this, ‘The king desires no bride-price except one hundred Philistine
foreskins, in vengeance on the king’s enemies’”. Saul was counting on getting David killed by the Philistines.

ISa 18:26 When his servants repeated this to David, David thought it would be a fine thing to be the king’s son-
in-law. And no time was lost

ISa 18:27 before David got up to go, he and his men, and killed two hundred of the Philistines. David brought
their foreskins back and counted them out before the king, so that he could be the king’s son-in-law. Saul then
gave him his daughter Michal in marriage.

ISa 18:28 Saul could not but see that Yahweh was with David, and that the whole House of Israel loved him;
ISa 18:29 Saul became more afraid of David than ever, and became his inveterate enemy.

1 Sa 1 8:30 The Philistine chiefs kept mounting their campaigns but, whenever they did so, David proved more
successful than any of Saul’s staff; consequently he gained great renown.

ISa 19:1 Saul let his son Jonathan and all his servants know of his intention to kill David. But Jonathan, Saul’s
son, held David in great affection;

1 Sa 1 9:2 and Jonathan warned David, “My father Saul is looking for a way to kill you, so be on your guard
tomorrow morning; go into hiding, stay out of sight.

ISa 19:3 I shall go out and keep my father company in the countryside where you will be, and shall talk to my
father about you; I shall see what the situation is and then tell you”.

ISa 19:4 Jonathan spoke highly of David to Saul his father and said, “The king should not harm his servant
David; far from harming you, what he has done has been greatly to your advantage.



ISa 19:5 He took his life in his hands, he killed the Philistine, and Yahweh brought about a great victory for all
Israel. You saw for yourself. How pleased you were! Why then sin against innocent blood by killing David for no
reason?”.

ISa 19:6 Saul was impressed by Jonathan’s words. Saul swore, “As Yahweh lives, I will not kill him”.

ISa 19:7 Jonathan called David and told him all this. Jonathan then brought him to Saul, and David remained in
attendance as before.

1 Sa 1 9:8 War broke out again and David sallied out to fight the Philistines; he inflicted a great defeat on them
and they fled before him.

ISa 19:9 An evil spirit from Yahweh came over Saul while he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand;
David was playing the harp.

ISa 19:10 Saul tried to pin David to the wall with his spear, but he avoided Saul’s thrust and the spear stuck in
the wall. David fled and made good his escape. That same night

ISa 19:11 Saul sent agents to watch David’s house, intending to kill him in the morning. But Michal, David’s
wife, warned him, “If you do not escape tonight, you will be a dead man tomorrow!”.

ISa 19:12 Michal then let David down through the window, and he made off, took to flight and so escaped.

ISa 19:13 Michal then took a domestic image, laid it on the bed, put a tress of goats’ hair at the head of the bed
and put a cover over it.

ISa 19:14 When Saul sent the agents to arrest David, she said, “He is ill”.

ISa 19:15 Saul sent the agents back to see David, with the words, “Bring him to me on his bed, for me to kill
him!”.

ISa 19:16 So in the agents went, and there in bed was the image, with the tress of goats’ hair on its head!

ISa 19:17 Saul then said to Michal, “Why have you deceived me like this and let my enemy go, and so make his
escape?”. Michal replied to Saul, “He said, ‘Let me go, or I shall kill you!’”.

ISa 19:18 David, having fled and made his escape, went to Samuel at Ramah and told him exactly how Saul
had treated him; he and Samuel went and lived in the huts.

ISa 19:19 Word was brought to Saul, “David is in the huts at Ramah”.

ISa 19:20 Saul accordingly sent agents to capture David; when they saw the community of prophets
prophesying, and Samuel there as their leader, the spirit of God came over Saul’s agents, and they too fell into
frenzy.

ISa 19:21 When Saul was told of this, he sent other agents, and they too fell into frenzy; Saul then sent a third
group of agents, and they fell into frenzy too.

ISa 19:22 He then went to Ramah himself and, arriving at the large storage-well at Seku, asked, “Where are
Samuel and David?”. And someöne said, “Why, they are in the huts at Ramah!”.

ISa 19:23 Making his way from there to the huts at Ramah, the spirit of God came over him too, and he went
along in a frenzy until he arrived at the huts at Ramah.

ISa 19:24 He too stripped off his clothes and he too fell into a frenzy in Samuel’s presence, then collapsed
naked on the ground for the rest of that day and all night. Hence the saying: Is Saul one of the prophets too?

ISa 20:1 Fleeing from the huts at Ramah, David went and confronted Jonathan, “What have I done, what is my
guilt, how have I wronged your father, for him to want to take my life?”.

ISa 20:2 He replied, “You must not think that! You are not going to die. My father, you see, does nothing,
important or unimportant, without confiding in me, so why should my father hide this from me? It is not true”.

1 Sa 20:3 In reply, David swore, “Your father knows very well that I enjoy your favour, and thinks, ‘Jonathan
must not know about this or he will be upset’. But, as Yahweh lives and as you yourself live, there is only a step
between me and death”.

1 Sa 20:4 At which, Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you think best, I will certainly do for you”.

1 Sa 20:5 David replied, “Look, tomorrow is New Moon and I ought to sit at table with the king, but you must let
me go and hide in the countryside until the evening.

ISa 20:6 If your father notices my absence, you must say, ‘David insistently asked me for permission to hurry
over to Bethlehem, his home town, because they are holding the annual sacrifice there for the whole clan’.

ISa 20:7 If he says, ‘Very well’, your servant is safe, but if he flies into a rage, you may be sure that he has
some evil plan.

ISa 20:8 Show your servant faithful love, since you have bound your servant to you by a pact in Yahweh’s
name. But if I am guilty, then kill me yourself — why take me to your father?”.

1 Sa 20:9 Jonathan replied, “Perish the thought! If I knew for sure that my father was determined to do you a
mischief, would I not have told you?”.

ISa 20:10 David then said to Jonathan, “Who will let me know if your father gives you a harsh answer?”.

ISa 20:11 Jonathan then said to David, “Come on, let us go out into the country”, and the pair of them went out
into the country.

ISa 20:12 Jonathan then said to David, “By Yahweh, God of Israel! I shall sound my father this time tomorrow; if



all is well for David and I do not then send and inform you,

ISa 20:13 may Yahweh bring unnameable ills to Jonathan and worse ones too! If my father intends to do you a
mischief, I shall tell you so and let you get away, so that you can be safe. And may Yahweh be with you as he
used to be with my father!

1 Sa 20: 1 4 If I am still alive, show your servant faithful love; if I die,

1 Sa 20: 1 5 never withdraw your faithful love from my family. When Yahweh has exterminated every enemy of
David’s from the face of the earth,

ISa 20:16 do not let Jonathan’s name be exterminated with Saul’s family, or may Yahweh call David to
account!”.

ISa 20:17 Jonathan then renewed his oath to David, since he loved him like his very soul.

ISa 20:18 Jonathan then said to David, “Tomorrow is New Moon; your absence will be noticed, since your place
will be empty.

ISa 20:19 The day after tomorrow your absence will be very marked, and you must go to the place where you
hid on the day of the deed, and stay beside that mound.

ISa 20:20 For my part, the day after tomorrow I shall shoot three arrows in that direction, as though at a target.

1 Sa 20:21 I shall then send a servant to go and find the arrows. If I say to him, ‘The arrows are this side of you,
get them’, come out, since all will be well for you and nothing the matter, as sure as Yahweh lives.

1 Sa 20:22 But if I say to him, ‘The arrows are ahead of you’, then be off, for Yahweh himself will be sending
you away.

ISa 20:23 And as regards the agreement we made, you and I, why, Yahweh is witness between us for ever”.
ISa 20:24 So David hid in the country; New Moon came and the king sat down to his meal.

ISa 20:25 He sat in his usual place with his back to the wall, Jonathan sat facing him and Abner sat next to
Saul; but David’s place was empty.

ISa 20:26 Saul said nothing that day, thinking, “It is sheer chance; he is unclean”.

ISa 20:27 On the day after New Moon, the second day, David’s place was still empty.

1 Sa 20:28 Saul said to his son Jonathan, “Why did not the son of Jesse come to the meal either yesterday or
today?”.

ISa 20:29 Jonathan answered Saul, “David insistently asked me for permission to go to Bethlehem. ‘Please let
me go’, he said, ‘for we are holding the clan sacrifice in the town and my brothers have ordered me to attend.

So now, if I enjoy your favour, let me get away and see my brothers’. That is why he has not come to the king’s
table”.

1 Sa 20:30 Saul flew into a rage with Jonathan and said, “Son of a rebellious slut! Don’t I know that you side with
the son of Jesse to your own shame and your mother’s dishonour?

ISa 20:31 As long as the son of Jesse lives on earth, neither you nor your royal rights are secure. Now have
him fetched and brought to me; he deserves to die”.

ISa 20:32 Jonathan retorted to his father Saul, “Why should he die? What has he done?”.

1 Sa 20:33 But Saul brandished his spear at him to strike him, and Jonathan realised that his father was
determined that David should die.

ISa 20:34 Hot with anger, Jonathan got up from the table and ate nothing on the second day of the month,
being upset about David - and because his father had insulted him.

1 Sa 20:35 Next morning, Jonathan went out into the country at the time agreed with David, taking a young
servant with him.

ISa 20:36 He said to his servant, “Run and find the arrows which I am going to shoot”, and the servant ran while
Jonathan shot an arrow ahead of him.

ISa 20:37 When the servant reached the spot to which Jonathan had shot the arrow, Jonathan shouted after
him, “Is not the arrow ahead of you?”.

ISa 20:38 Again Jonathan shouted after the servant, “Quick! Hurry, do not stand around”. Jonathan’s servant
picked up the arrow and brought it back to his master.

1 Sa 20:39 The servant suspected nothing; only Jonathan and David knew what was meant.

ISa 20:40 Jonathan then gave his weapons to his servant and said, “Go and carry them to the town”.

ISa 20:41 As soon as the servant had gone, David stood up beside the mound, threw himself to the ground,
prostrating himself three times. They then embraced each other, both weeping copiously.

ISa 20:42 Jonathan then said to David, “Go in peace. And as regards the oath that both of us have sworn by
the name of Yahweh, may Yahweh be witness between you and me, between your descendants and mine for
ever”.

ISa 21:1 David then got up and left, and Jonathan went back to the town.

1 Sa 21 :2 David then went to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech came out trembling to meet David and
said, “Why are you alone? Why is nobody with you?”.

1 Sa 21 :3 David replied to Ahimelech the priest, “The king has given me an order and said to me, ‘Do not let



anyone know anything about the mission on which I am sending you, or about the order which I have given you’.
I have arranged to meet the guards at such and such a place.

1 Sa 21 :4 Meanwhile, if you have five loaves of bread to hand, give them to me, or whatever there is”.

ISa 21:5 The priest replied to David, “I have no ordinary bread to hand; there are only consecrated loaves of
permanent offering - provided that the men have kept themselves from women?”.

ISa 21 :6 David replied to the priest, “Certainly, women have been forbidden to us, as always when I set off on a
campaign. The men’s things are clean. Though this is a profane journey, they are certainly clean today as far as
their things are concerned”.

1 Sa 21 :7 The priest then gave him what had been consecrated, for the only bread there was the loaves of
permanent offering, which is taken out of Yahweh’s presence, to be replaced by warm bread on the day when it
is removed.

1 Sa 21 :8 Now one of Saul’s servants happened to be there that day, detained in Yahweh’s presence; his name
was Doeg the Edomite and he was the strongest of Saul’s shepherds.

1 Sa 21 :9 David then said to Ahimelech, “Have you no spear or sword here to hand? I did not bring either my
sword or my weapons with me, because the king’s business was urgent”.

ISa 21:10 The priest replied, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine whom you killed in the Valley of the Terebinth
is here, wrapped in a piece of clothing behind the ephod; if you care to take it, do so, for that is the only one
here”. David said, “There is nothing like that one; give it to me”.

ISa 21:11 David journeyed on and that day fled out of Saul’s reach, going to Achish king of Gath.

ISa 21:12 Achish’s servants said to him, “Is not this David, the king of the country? Was it not of him that they
sang as they danced: Saul has killed his thousands, and David his tens of thousands?”.

ISa 21:13 David pondered on these words and became very frightened of Achish king of Gath.

ISa 21:14 When their eyes were on him, he played the madman and, when they held him, he feigned lunacy.

He drummed his feet on the doors of the gate and let his spittle run down his beard.

ISa 21:15 Achish said to his servants, “You can see that this man is mad. Why bring him to me?

ISa 21:16 Have I not enough madmen, without your bringing me this one to weary me with his antics? Is he to
join my household?”.

ISa 22:1 David left there and took refuge in the Cave of Adullam; his brothers and his father’s whole family
heard this and joined him there.

ISa 22:2 All those in distress, all those in debt, all those who had a grievance, gathered round him and he
became their leader. There were about four hundred men with him.

ISa 22:3 From there David went to Mizpah in Moab and said to the king of Moab, “Allow my father and mother
to stay with you until I know what God intends to do for me”.

ISa 22:4 He left them with the king of Moab and there they stayed all the time that David was in the stronghold.

1 Sa 22:5 The prophet Gad, however, said to David, “Do not stay in the stronghold; leave and make your way
into the territory of Judah”. David then left and went to the forest of Hereth.

ISa 22:6 When Saul heard that David and the men with him had been discovered, Saul was at Gibeah, seated
under the tamarisk on the high place, spear in hand, with all his staff standing round him.

ISa 22:7 “Listen, Benjaminites!”. said Saul to them, “Is the son of Jesse going to give you all fields and vineyards
and make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds

1 Sa 22:8 that you all conspire against me? No one warned me when my son made a pact with the son of Jesse;
none of you felt sorry for me or warned me when my son incited my servant to become my enemy, as he is now”.
1 Sa 22:9 Then, up spoke Doeg the Edomite, who was in command of Saul’s staff, “I saw the son of Jesse
coming to Nob, to Ahimelech son of Ahitub.

ISa 22:10 That man consulted Yahweh on his behalf, gave him provisions and also the sword of Goliath the
Philistine”.

ISa 22:11 The king then sent for the priest Ahimelech son of Ahitub and his whole family, the priests of Nob;
they all came to the king.

ISa 22:12 Saul said, “Now listen, son of Ahitub!”. He replied, “Here I am, my lord”.

ISa 22:13 “Why have you conspired against me”, said Saul, “you and the son of Jesse, giving him bread and a
sword and consulting God on his behalf, for him to rebel against me as is now the case?”.

ISa 22:14 Ahimelech replied to the king, “Of all those in your service, who is more loyal than David son-in-law to
the king, captain of your bodyguard, honoured in your household?

ISa 22:15 Was today the first time I ever consulted God on his behalf? Indeed it was not! The king has no
grounds for bringing any charge against his servant or against his whole family, for your servant knew nothing
whatever about all this”.

ISa 22:16 The king retorted, “You must die, Ahimelech, you and your whole family”.

ISa 22:17 The king said to the scouts who were standing round him, “Forward! and put the priests of Yahweh to
death, for they too are on David’s side, they knew that he was escaping, yet did not warn me of it”. The king’s



professional soldiers, however, would not lift a hand to strike the priests of Yahweh.

ISa 22:18 The king then said to Doeg, “Forward, you! Fall on the priests! 1 Doeg the Edomite stepped forward
and fell on the priests, himself that day killing eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod.

ISa 22:19 Nob, the town of the priests, Saul put to the sword: men and women, children and infants, cattle,
donkeys and sheep.

1 Sa 22:20 One son of Ahimelech son of Ahitub alone escaped. His name was Abiathar, and he fled away to join
David.

ISa 22:21 When Abiathar told David that Saul had slaughtered the priests of Yahweh,

ISa 22:22 David said to Abiathar, “I knew, that day when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would be sure to
inform Saul. I am responsible for the death of all your kinsmen.

ISa 22:23 Stay with me, do not be afraid, for he who seeks your life seeks mine; you will be safe with me”.

ISa 23:1 News was then brought to David, “The Philistines are besieging Keilah and plundering the threshing-
floors”.

ISa 23:2 David consulted Yahweh, “Shall I go and fight these Philistines?”. Yahweh replied to David, “Go and
fight the Philistines and save Keilah”.

ISa 23:3 But David’s men said to him, “We are already afraid here in Judah; how much more, then, if we go to
Keilah to fight the Philistine troops!”.

ISa 23:4 So David consulted Yahweh again and Yahweh replied, “Be on your way; go down to Keilah, since I
shall give the Philistines into your power”.

1 Sa 23:5 So David and his men went to Keilah and fought the Philistines and carried off their cattle and inflicted
a great defeat on them. Thus David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.

ISa 23:6 When Abiathar son of Ahimelech took refuge with David, he went down to Keilah with the ephod in his
hand.

ISa 23:7 When word was brought to Saul that David had gone to Keilah he said, “God has delivered him into
my power: he has trapped himself by going into a town with gates and bars”.

ISa 23:8 Saul called all the people to arms, to go down to Keilah and besiege David and his men.

1 Sa 23:9 David, however, was aware that Saul was plotting evil against him, and said to Abiathar the priest,
“Bring the ephod”.

ISa 23:10 David said, “Yahweh, God of Israel, your servant has heard that Saul is preparing to come to Keilah
and destroy the town because of me.

ISa 23:11 Will Saul come down as your servant has heard? Yahweh, God of Israel, I beg you, let your servant
know”. Yahweh replied, “He will come down”.

ISa 23:12 David then went on to ask, “Will the notables of Keilah hand me and my men over to Saul?”. Yahweh
replied, “They will hand you over”.

ISa 23:13 At this, David made off with his men, about six hundred in number; they left Keilah and went where
they could. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he abandoned the expedition.

ISa 23:14 David stayed in the desert, in the strongholds; he stayed in the mountains, in the desert of Ziph; Saul
kept looking for him day after day, but God did not deliver him into his power.

ISa 23:15 David was aware that Saul had mounted an expedition to take his life. David was then at Horesh in
the desert of Ziph.

ISa 23:16 Jonathan son of Saul set off and went to David at Horesh and encouraged him in the name of God.
ISa 23:17 “Do not be afraid”, he said, “for my father Saul’s hand will not reach you. You are to reign over Israel,
and I shall be second to you. Saul my father is himself aware of this”.

ISa 23:18 And the two made a pact before Yahweh. David stayed at Horesh and Jonathan went home.

ISa 23:19 Some men from Ziph then went up to Saul at Gibeah and said, “Look, David is hiding among us in
the strongholds at Horesh, on the Hill of Hachilah to the south of the wastelands.

1 Sa 23:20 Now whenever you wish to go down, my lord king, do so; we shall make it our task to hand him over
to the king”.

ISa 23:21 Saul replied, “May you be blessed by Yahweh for sympathising with me.

ISa 23:22 Go and make doubly sure, find out exactly what place he frequents, for I have been told that he is
very cunning.

ISa 23:23 Take careful note of all the hiding places where he lurks, and come back to me when you are certain.
I shall then come with you and, if he is in the country, I shall track him down through every clan in Judah!”.

ISa 23:24 Setting off they went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Meanwhile, David and his men were in the desert of
Maon, in the plain to the south of the wastelands.

ISa 23:25 When Saul and his men set out in search, David was told and went down to the gorge running
through the desert of Maon.

ISa 23:26 Saul and his men proceeded along one side of the mountain, David and his men along the other.
David was hurrying to escape from Saul, while Saul and his men were trying to cross over to David and his



men’s side, to capture them,

ISa 23:27 when a messenger came to Saul and said, “Come at once, the Philistines have invaded the country”.

1 Sa 23:28 So Saul broke off his pursuit of David and went to oppose the Philistines. That is why the place is
called the Gorge of Separations.

ISa 24:1 From there David went up and installed himself in the strongholds of En-Gedi.

ISa 24:2 Once Saul was back from pursuing the Philistines, he was told, “David is now in the desert of En-Gedi”.
ISa 24:3 Saul thereupon took three thousand men selected from all Israel and went in search of David and his
men east of the Rocks of the Mountain Goats.

ISa 24:4 He came to the sheepfolds along the route, where there was a cave, and went in to cover his feet.

Now David and his men were sitting in the recesses of the cave;

1 Sa 24:5 David’s men said to him, “Today is the day of which Yahweh said to you, ‘I shall deliver your enemy
into your power; do what you like with him’”. David got up and, unobserved, cut off the border of Saul’s cloak.

1 Sa 24:6 Afterwards David reproached himself for having cut off the border of Saul’s cloak.

ISa 24:7 He said to his men, “Yahweh preserve me from doing such a thing to my lord as to raise my hand
against him, since he is Yahweh’s anointed”.

ISa 24:8 By these words David restrained his men and would not let them attack Saul.

ISa 24:9 Saul then left the cave and went on his way. After this, David too left the cave and called after Saul,
“My lord king!”. Saul looked behind him and David, bowing to the ground, prostrated himself.

ISa 24:10 David then said to Saul, “Why do you listen to people who say, ‘David intends your ruin?’

1 Sa 24: 1 1 This very day you have seen for yourself how Yahweh put you in my power in the cave and how,
refusing to kill you, I spared you saying, ‘I will not raise my hand against my lord, since he is Yahweh’s
anointed’.

ISa 24:12 Look, father, look at the border of your cloak in my hand. Since, although I cut the border off your
cloak, I did not kill you, surely you realise that I intend neither mischief nor crime. I have not wronged you, and
yet you hunt me down to take my life.

1 Sa 24: 1 3 May Yahweh be judge between me and you, and may Yahweh avenge me on you; but I shall never
lay a hand on you!

ISa 24:14 (As the old proverb says: Wickedness comes out of wicked people, but I shall never lay a hand on
you!)

ISa 24:15 On whose trail is the king of Israel campaigning? Whom are you pursuing? On the trail of a dead
dog, of a flea!

ISa 24:16 May Yahweh be the judge and decide between me and you; may he examine and defend my cause
and give judgement for me by rescuing me from your clutches!”.

ISa 24:17 When David had finished saying this to Saul, Saul said, “Is that your voice, my son David?”. And Saul
began to weep aloud.

ISa 24:18 “You are upright and I am not”, he said to David, “since you have behaved well to me, whereäs I have
behaved badly to you.

ISa 24:19 And today you have shown how well you have behaved to me, since Yahweh had put me in your
power but you did not kill me.

1 Sa 24:20 When a man comes on his enemy, does he let him go unmolested? May Yahweh reward you for the
good you have done me today!

ISa 24:21 Now I know that you will indeed reign and that the sovereignty in Israel will pass into your hands.

1 Sa 24:22 Now swear to me by Yahweh that you will not suppress my descendants once I am gone, or blot my
name out of my family”.

ISa 24:23 This David swore to Saul, and Saul went home while David and his men went back to the stronghold.
ISa 25:1 Samuel died and all Israel assembled to mourn for him. They buried him at his home in Ramah. David
then set off and went down to the desert of Maon.

ISa 25:2 Now, there was a man in Maon whose business was at Carmel; the man was very rich: he owned
three thousand sheep and a thousand goats. He was then at Carmel, having his sheep shorn.

ISa 25:3 The man’s name was Nabal and his wife’s Abigail. She was a woman of intelligence and beauty, but
the man was miserly and churlish. He was a Calebite.

ISa 25:4 When David heard in the desert that Nabal was at his sheepshearing,

ISa 25:5 he sent ten men off, having said to them, “Go up to Carmel, visit Nabal and greet him from me.

ISa 25:6 And this is what you are to say to my brother, ‘Peace to you, peace to your family, peace to all that is
yours!

1 Sa 25:7 I hear that you now have the shearers; your shepherds were with us recently: we did not molest them,
nor did they lose anything all the while they were at Carmel.

ISa 25:8 Ask your young men and they will tell you. I hope that you will give the men a welcome, coming as we
do on a festival. Whatever you have to hand please give to your servants and to your son David’”.



ISa 25:9 David’s men went and said all this to Nabal for David, and waited.

ISa 25:10 Nabal retorted to the men in David’s service, “Who is David? Who is the son of Jesse?

ISa 25:11 There are many servants nowadays who run away from their masters. Am I to take my bread and my
wine and the meat that I have slaughtered for my shearers and give it to men who come from I know not where?”.
ISa 25:12 David’s men turned on their heels and went back, and on their arrival told him exactly what had been
said.

ISa 25:13 David then said to his men, “Every man buckle on his sword!”. And they buckled on their swords, and
David buckled on his too; about four hundred followed David while two hundred stayed with the baggage.

ISa 25:14 Now one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife. He said, “David sent messengers from the
desert to greet our master, but he flared up at them.

ISa 25:15 Now, these men were very good to us; they did not molest us and we lost nothing all the time we had
anything to do with them while we were out in the country.

ISa 25:16 Night and day, they were like a rampart to us, all the time we were with them, minding the sheep.

1 Sa 25: 1 7 So now make up your mind what you should do, for the ruin of our master and his whole family is a
certainty, and he is such a brute that no one can say a word to him”.

ISa 25:18 Abigail hastily took two hundred loaves, two skins of wine, five sheep ready prepared, five measures
of roasted grain, a hundred bunches of raisins and two hundred cakes of figs and loaded them on donkeys.

ISa 25:19 She said to her servants, “Go on ahead, I shall follow you” — but she did not tell her husband Nabal.
ISa 25:20 As she was riding her donkey down behind a fold in the mountain, David and his men happened to
be coming down in her direction; and she met them.

1 Sa 25:21 Now, David had decided, “It was a waste of time my guarding all this man’s property in the desert so
that he lost nothing at all! He has repaid me bad for good.

ISa 25:22 May God bring unnameable ills on David and worse ones, too, if by morning I leave a single manjack
alive of all who belong to him!”.

ISa 25:23 As soon as Abigail saw David, she quickly dismounted from the donkey and, falling on her face in
front of David, prostrated herself on the ground.

ISa 25:24 She fell at his feet and said, “Let me take the blame, my lord. Let your servant speak in your ear;
listen to what your servant has to say!

ISa 25:25 My lord, please pay no attention to this brute Nabal for his nature is like his name; ‘Brute’ is his
name and brutal he is. But I, your servant, did not see the men whom my lord sent.

ISa 25:26 And now, my lord, as Yahweh lives and as your soul lives, by Yahweh who kept you from the crime
of bloodshed and from taking vengeance with your own hand, may your enemies and all those ill-disposed
towards you become like Nabal.

1 Sa 25:27 As for the present which your servant has brought my lord, I should like this to be given to the men in
your service.

ISa 25:28 Please forgive your servant for any offence I have given you, for Yahweh will certainly assure you of
a lasting dynasty, since you are fighting Yahweh’s battles and no fault has been found in you throughout your
life.

ISa 25:29 Should anyone set out to hunt you down and try to kill you, your life will be kept close in the wallet of
life with Yahweh your God, while your enemies’ lives he will fling out of the pouch of the sling.

1 Sa 25:30 Once Yahweh has done for you all the good things which he has said he will do for you, and made
you ruler of Israel,

ISa 25:31 you must have no anxiety, my lord, no remorse, over having wantonly shed blood, over having taken
a revenge. When Yahweh has done well by you, then remember your servant”.

ISa 25:32 David said to Abigail, “Blessed be Yahweh, God of Israel, who sent you to meet me today!

ISa 25:33 Blessed be your wisdom and blessed you yourself for today having restrained me from the crime of
bloodshed and from exacting revenge!

ISa 25:34 But as Yahweh, God of Israel, lives, who prevented me from harming you, had you not hurried out to
meet me, I swear Nabal would not have had a single manjack left alive by morning!”.

ISa 25:35 David then accepted what she had brought him and said, “Go home in peace; yes, I have listened to
you and have pardoned you”.

ISa 25:36 Abigail returned to Nabal. He was holding a feast, a princely feast, in his house; Nabal was in high
spirits, and as he was very drunk she told him nothing at all till it was daylight.

ISa 25:37 In the morning, when Nabal’s wine had left him and his wife told him everything that had happened,
his heart died within him and he became like a stone.

ISa 25:38 About ten days later Yahweh struck Nabal, and he died.

ISa 25:39 When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Blessed be Yahweh for having defended my cause
over the insult which I received from Nabal, and for having restrained his servant from doing wrong! Yahweh has
made Nabal’s wickedness rebound on his own head!”.



ISa 25:40 David then sent Abigail an offer of marriage. When the men in David’s service came to Abigail at
Carmel, they said, “David has sent us to take you to him, to be his wife”.

1 Sa 25:41 She stood up, then prostrated herself on the ground. “Consider your servant a slave”, she said, “to
wash the feet of my lord’s servants”.

ISa 25:42 Quickly Abigail stood up again and mounted a donkey; followed by five of her servant-girls, she
followed David’s messengers and became his wife.

1 Sa 25:43 David had also married Ahinoam of Jezreel and he kept them both as wives.

ISa 25:44 Saul had given his daughter Michal, David’s wife, to Palti son of Laish, from Gallim.

ISa 26:1 Some men from Ziph went to Saul at Gibeah and said, “Look, David is hiding on the Hill of Hachilah on
the edge of the wastelands!”.

ISa 26:2 So Saul set off and went down to the desert of Ziph, accompanied by three thousand picked men of
Israel, to search for David in the desert of Ziph.

1 Sa 26:3 Saul pitched camp on the Hill of Hachilah, which is on the edge of the wastelands near the road. David
was then living in the desert and saw that Saul had come after him into the desert.

ISa 26:4 Accordingly, David sent out spies and learned that Saul had indeed arrived.

ISa 26:5 Setting off, David went to the place where Saul had pitched camp. He saw the place where Saul and
Abner son of Ner, commander of his army, had bedded down. Saul had bedded down inside the camp with the
troops bivouacking round him.

ISa 26:6 Speaking to Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah and brother of Joab, David said, “Who
will come down with me to the camp, to Saul?”. Abishai answered, “I will go down with you”.

1 Sa 26:7 So in the dark David and Abishai made their way towards the force, where they found Saul lying
asleep inside the camp, his spear stuck in the ground beside his head, with Abner and the troops lying round
him.

ISa 26:8 Abishai then said to David, “Today God has put your enemy in your power; so now let me pin him to
the ground with his own spear. Just one stroke! I shall not need to strike him twice”.

1 Sa 26:9 David said to Abishai, “Do not kill him, for who could raise his hand against Yahweh’s anointed and go
unpunished?

ISa 26:10 As Yahweh lives”, David said, “Yahweh himself will strike him down: either the day will come for him
to die, or he will go into battle and perish then.

ISa 26:11 Yahweh forbid that I should raise my hand against Yahweh’s anointed! But now let us take the spear
beside his head and the pitcher of water, and let us go away”.

ISa 26:12 David took the spear and the pitcher of water from beside Saul’s head, and they made off. No one
saw, no one knew, no one woke up; they were all asleep, because a torpor from Yahweh had fallen on them.

ISa 26:13 David crossed to the other side and halted on the top of the mountain a long way off; there was a
wide space between them.

ISa 26:14 David then called out to the troops and to Abner son of Ner, “Abner, why don’t you answer?”. Abner
replied, “Who is that calling?”.

ISa 26:15 David said to Abner, “Are you not a man? Who is your equal in Israel? Why, then, did you not guard
the king your lord? One of the people came to kill the king your lord.

ISa 26:16 What you did was not well done. As Yahweh lives, you all deserve to die since you did not guard
your lord, Yahweh’s anointed. Look where the king’s spear is now, and the pitcher of water which was beside his
head!”.

ISa 26:17 Recognising David’s voice, Saul said, “Is that your voice, my son David?”. David replied, “It is my
voice, my lord king.

ISa 26:18 Why is my lord pursuing his servant?”. he said. “What have I done? What crime have I committed?

ISa 26:19 May my lord king now listen to his servant’s words: if Yahweh has incited you against me, may he be
appeased with an offering; but if human beings have done it, may they be accursed before Yahweh, since they
have as effectively banished me today from sharing in Yahweh’s heritage as if they had said, ‘Go and serve
other gods!’.

ISa 26:20 So I pray now that my blood shall not be shed on soil remote from Yahweh’s presence, when the
king of Israel has mounted an expedition to take my life, as one might hunt a partridge in the mountains!”.

ISa 26:21 Saul replied, “I have done wrong! Come back, my son David; I shall never harm you again, since
today you have shown respect for my life. Yes, I have behaved like a fool, I have been profoundly in the wrong”.
ISa 26:22 In reply, David said, “Here is the king’s spear. Let one of the men come across and get it.

ISa 26:23 May Yahweh reward each as each has been upright and loyal. Today Yahweh put you in my power
but I would not raise my hand against Yahweh’s anointed.

ISa 26:24 As today I set great value by your life, so may Yahweh set great value by my life and deliver me from
every tribulation!”.

ISa 26:25 Saul then said, “May you be blessed, my son David! In what you undertake, you will certainly



succeed”. David then went on his way and Saul returned home.

ISa 27:1 “One of these days”, David thought, “I shall perish at the hand of Saul. The best thing that I can do is to
get away into the country of the Philistines; then Saul will give up tracking me through the length and breadth of
Israel and I shall be safe from him”.

ISa 27:2 So David set off and went over, he and his six hundred men, to Achish son of Maoch, king of Gath.
ISa 27:3 He settled at Gath with Achish, he and his men, each with his family and David with his two wives,
Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail widow of Nabal of Carmel.

ISa 27:4 When news reached Saul that David had fled to Gath, he stopped searching for him.

ISa 27:5 David said to Achish, “If I have won your favour, let me be given a place in one of the outlying towns,
where I can live. Why should your servant live in the royal city with you?”.

ISa 27:6 That very day Achish gave him Ziklag; and this is why Ziklag has been the property of the kings of
Judah to the present day.

ISa 27:7 The time that David stayed in Philistine territory amounted to a year and four months.

ISa 27:8 David and his men went out on raids against the Geshurites, Girzites and Amalekites, for these are
the tribes inhabiting the region which, from Telam, goes in the direction of Shur, as far as Egypt.

ISa 27:9 David laid the countryside waste and left neither man nor woman alive; he carried off the sheep and
cattle, the donkeys, camels and clothing, and then came back again to Achish.

ISa 27:10 Achish would ask, “Where did you go raiding today?”. David would reply, “Against the Negeb of
Judah”, or “the Negeb of Jerahmeel”, or “the Negeb of the Kenites”.

ISa 27:11 David spared neither man nor woman to bring back alive to Gath, “in case”, as he thought, “they
inform on us and say, ‘David did such and such’”. This was the way David conducted his raids all the time he
stayed in Philistine territory.

ISa 27:12 Achish trusted David. “He has made himself detested by his own people Israel”, he thought, “and so
will be my servant for ever”.

1 Sa 28: 1 It then happened that the Philistines mustered their forces for war, to fight Israel, and Achish said to
David, “It is understood that you and your men go into battle with me”.

ISa 28:2 David said to Achish, “In that case, you will soon see what your servant can do”. Achish replied to
David, “Right, I shall appoint you as my permanent bodyguard”.

ISa 28:3 Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had mourned him and buried him at Ramah, his own town. Saul
had expelled the necromancers and wizards from the country.

ISa 28:4 Meanwhile the Philistines had mustered and had come and pitched camp at Shunem. Saul mustered
all Israel and they encamped at Gilboa.

ISa 28:5 When Saul saw the Philistine camp, he was afraid and his heart trembled violently.

ISa 28:6 Saul consulted Yahweh, but Yahweh gave him no answer, either by dream, divination or prophet.

ISa 28:7 Saul then said to his servants, “Find a necromancer for me, so that I can go and consult her”. His
servants replied, “There is a necromancer at En-Dor”.

ISa 28:8 And so Saul, disguising himself and changing his clothes, set out accompanied by two men; their visit
to the woman took place at night. “Disclose the future to me”, he said, “by means of a ghost. Conjure up the one I
shall name to you”.

ISa 28:9 The woman replied, “Look, you know what Saul has done, how he has outlawed necromancers and
wizards from the country; why are you setting a trap for my life, then, to have me killed?”.

ISa 28:10 But Saul swore to her by Yahweh, “As Yahweh lives”, he said, “no blame shall attach to you for this
business”.

ISa 28:11 The woman asked, “Whom shall I conjure up for you?”. He replied, “Conjure up Samuel”.

ISa 28:12 The woman then saw Samuel and, giving a great cry, she said to Saul, “Why have you deceived me?
You are Saul!”.

ISa 28:13 The king said, “Do not be afraid! What do you see?”. The woman replied to Saul, “I see a ghost rising
from the earth”.

ISa 28:14 “What is he like?”. he asked. She replied, “It is an old man coming up; he is wrapped in a cloak”. Saul
then knew that it was Samuel and, bowing to the ground, prostrated himself.

ISa 28:15 Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed my rest by conjuring me up?”. Saul replied, “I am in
great distress; the Philistines are waging war on me, and God has abandoned me and no longer answers me
either by prophet or by dream; and so I have summoned you to tell me what I ought to do”.

ISa 28:16 Samuel said, “Why consult me, when Yahweh has abandoned you and has become your enemy?
ISa 28:17 Yahweh has treated you as he foretold through me; he has snatched the sovereignty from your hand
and given it to your neighbour, David,

ISa 28:18 because you disobeyed Yahweh’s voice and did not execute his fierce anger against Amalek. That is
why Yahweh is treating you like this today.

ISa 28:19 What is more, Yahweh will deliver Israel and you too, into the power of the Philistines. Tomorrow you



and your sons will be with me; and Yahweh will hand over the army of Israel into the power of the Philistines”.

ISa 28:20 Immediately Saul fell full length on the ground. He was terrified by what Samuel had said and was
also weak from having eaten nothing all that day and night.

ISa 28:21 The woman went to Saul and, seeing his terror, said, “Look, your servant has obeyed your order; I
have taken my life in my hands and obeyed the command which you gave me.

ISa 28:22 Now please, you in your turn listen to what your servant has to say. Let me offer you a piece of
bread. Eat something and get some strength for your journey”.

ISa 28:23 But he refused. “I will not eat”, he said. His servants however pressed him, and so did the woman.
Allowing himself to be persuaded by them, he got up from the ground and sat on the bed.

ISa 28:24 The woman owned a fattened calf which she quickly slaughtered, and she took some flour and
kneaded it and with it baked some unleavened cakes

1 Sa 28:25 which she served to Saul and his servants; they ate, and then set off and left the same night.

1 Sa 29: 1 The Philistines mustered all their forces at Aphek while the Israelites pitched camp near the spring in
Jezreel.

1 Sa 29:2 The Philistine commanders marched past with their hundreds and their thousands, and David and his
men brought up the rear with Achish.

ISa 29:3 The Philistine chiefs asked, “What are these Hebrews doing?”. Achish replied to them, “Why, this is
David the servant of Saul, king of Israel, who has been with me for the last year or two. I have had no fault to find
with him from the day he gave himself up to me until the present time”.

ISa 29:4 But the Philistine chiefs were angry with him. “Send the man back”, they said, “make him go back to the
place which you assigned to him. He cannot go into battle with us, in case he turns on us once battle is joined.
Would there be a better way for the man to regain his master’s favour than with the heads of these men here?

1 Sa 29:5 Is not this the David of whom they sang as they danced: Saul has killed his thousands, and David his
tens of thousands'?

ISa 29:6 So Achish called David and said, “As Yahweh lives, you are loyal, and I am quite content with all your
doings in our campaigning together, since I have found no fault with you from the day you came to me until the
present time. But you are not acceptable to the chiefs.

ISa 29:7 So go home, in peace, rather than antagonise them”.

1 Sa 29:8 “But what have I done”, David asked Achish, “what fault have you had to find with your servant from the
day I entered your service to the present time, for me not to be allowed to go and fight the enemies of my lord
the king?”.

ISa 29:9 In reply, Achish said to David, “In my opinion, it is true, you are as good as an angel of God; but the
Philistine chiefs have said, ‘He must not go into battle with us’.

ISa 29:10 So get up early tomorrow morning, with your master’s servants who came with you, and go to the
place which I assigned to you. Do not harbour resentment, since personally I have no fault to find with you. Get
up early tomorrow morning and, as soon as it is light, be off”.

1 Sa 29: 1 1 So David and his men got up early to leave at dawn and go back to Philistine territory. And the
Philistines marched on Jezreel.

ISa 30:1 Now by the time David and his men reached Ziklag three days later, the Amalekites had raided the
Negeb and Ziklag; they had sacked Ziklag and burnt it down.

ISa 30:2 They had taken the women prisoner, and everyone who was there, both small and great. They had not
killed anyone, but had carried them off and gone away.

1 Sa 30:3 When David and his men arrived, they found the town burnt down and their wives and sons and
daughters taken captive.

ISa 30:4 Then David and the people with him wept aloud till they were too weak to weep any more.

1 Sa 30:5 David’s two wives had been captured: Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail widow of Nabal of Carmel.

ISa 30:6 David was in great trouble, since the people were talking of stoning him; the people all felt very bitter,
each man for his own sons and daughters. But David took courage from Yahweh his God.

ISa 30:7 To the priest Abiathar son of Ahimelech, David said, “Bring me the ephod”. Abiathar brought the ephod
to David.

ISa 30:8 David then consulted Yahweh, “Shall I go in pursuit of these raiders? Will I overtake them?”. The
answer was, “Go in pursuit; you will certainly overtake them and rescue the captives”.

ISa 30:9 David accordingly set off with the six hundred men who were with him and reached the torrent of
Besor.

ISa 30:10 David then continued the pursuit with four hundred men, two hundred staying behind who were too
exhausted to cross the torrent of Besor.

ISa 30:11 Out in the country they found an Egyptian and brought him to David. They gave him some bread to
eat and some water to drink;

ISa 30:12 they also gave him a piece of fig cake and two bunches of raisins; he ate these and his spirits revived



— he had had nothing to eat or drink for three days and three nights.

ISa 30:13 David then said to him, “Whose man are you and where do you come from?”. He replied, “I am a
young Egyptian, the slave of an Amalekite; my master abandoned me because I fell sick three days ago.

1 Sa 30: 1 4 We raided the Negeb of the Cherethites, and the Negeb of Judah, and the Negeb of Caleb too, and
we burnt Ziklag down”.

ISa 30:15 David said, “Will you guide me to these raiders?”. He replied, “Swear to me by God not to kill me or
hand me over to my master, and I will guide you to these raiders”.

ISa 30:16 He guided him to them, and there they were, scattered over the whole countryside, eating, drinking
and celebrating, on account of the enormous booty which they had brought back from the territory of the
Philistines and the territory of Judah.

ISa 30:17 David slaughtered them from dawn until the evening of the following day. No one escaped, except
four hundred young men who mounted camels and fled.

ISa 30:18 He rescued everything that the Amalekites had taken — David also rescued his two wives.

1 Sa 30: 1 9 Nothing of theirs was lost, whether small or great, from the booty or sons and daughters — everything
that had been taken from them; David recovered everything.

ISa 30:20 They captured the flocks and herds as well and drove them in front of him. “This is David’s booty”,
they shouted.

ISa 30:21 When David reached the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow him and whom he
had left at the torrent of Besor, they came out to meet David and the party accompanying him; David
approached with his party and greeted them.

ISa 30:22 But all the rogues and scoundrels among the men who had gone with David began saying, “Since
they did not go with us, we shall not give them any of the booty which we have rescued, except that each of
them can have his wife and children. Let them take them away and be off”.

ISa 30:23 But David said, “Do not behave like this, brothers, with what Yahweh has given us; he has protected
us and has handed over to us the raiders who attacked us.

1 Sa 30:24 Who would agree with you on this? No: As the share of the man who goes into battle, so is the share
of the man who stays with the baggage. They will share alike”.

ISa 30:25 And from that day on, he made that a rule and custom for Israel, which obtains to the present day.
ISa 30:26 When David reached Ziklag, he sent parts of the booty to the elders of Judah, town by town, with this
message, “Here is a present for you, taken from the booty of Yahweh’s enemies':

ISa 30:27 to those in Bethel, to those in Ramoth of the Negeb,

ISa 30:28 to those in Jattir, to those in Aroer, to those in Siphmoth, to those in Eshtemoa,

ISa 30:29 to those in Carmel, to those in the towns of Jerahmeel, to those in the towns of the Kenites,

ISa 30:30 to those in Hormah, to those in Borashan, to those in Athach,

ISa 30:31 to those in Hebron and to all the places which David and his men had frequented.

ISa 31:1 The Philistines gave battle to Israel, and the Israelites, fleeing from the Philistines, fell and were

slaughtered on Mount Gilboa.

ISa 31:2 The Philistines bore down on Saul and his sons, and they killed Jonathan, Abinadab and Malchishua,
Saul’s sons.

1 Sa 31 :3 The fighting grew fiercer round Saul; the archers came upon him, and he was severely wounded
1 Sa 31 :4 by the archers. Saul then said to his armour-bearer, “Draw your sword and run me through with it; I do
not want these uncircumcised men to come and make fun of me”. But his armour-bearer was very much afraid
and would not do it. So Saul took his own sword and fell on it.

ISa 31:5 His armour-bearer, seeing that Saul was dead, fell on his sword too and died with him.

1 Sa 31 :6 Thus died Saul, his three sons and his armour-bearer, together on the same day.

1 Sa 31 :7 When the Israelites who were on the other side of the Jordan saw that the Israelites had been routed
and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their towns and fled. The Philistines then came and
occupied them.

1 Sa 31 :8 When the Philistines came on the following day to strip the dead, they found Saul and his three sons
lying on Mount Gilboa.

1 Sa 31 :9 They cut off his head and, stripping him of his armour, had these carried round the territory of the
Philistines to proclaim the good news to their idols and their people.

ISa 31:10 They put his armour in the temple of Astarte; and his body they fastened to the walls of Beth-Shean.
ISa 31:11 When the inhabitants of Jabesh in Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,

ISa 31:12 the warriors all set out and, having marched all night, took the bodies of Saul and his sons off the
walls of Beth-Shean; they brought them to Jabesh and burned them there.

ISa 31:13 They then took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk of Jabesh, and fasted for seven
days.
