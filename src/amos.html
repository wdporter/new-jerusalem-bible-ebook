<h4>Title (1:1)</h4>

<p>Words of Amos one of the shepherds of Tekoa. The visions he had about Israel, in the time of Uzziah king of Judah and Jeroboam son of Joash, king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.</p>

<h4>Introduction (1:2)</h4>

<p>He said:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Yahweh roars from Zion, </span><br />
		<span>and makes himself heard from Jerusalem; </span><br />
		<span>the shepherds’ pastures mourn, </span><br />
		<span>and the crown of Carmel dries up.</span>

<h4>Damascus (1:3–5)</h4>

<p>Yahweh says this:</p> 

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>For the three crimes, the four crimes of Damascus,</span><br />
		<span>I have made my decree and will not relent:</span><br />
		<span>because they have threshed Gilead with iron threshing-sledges,</span><br />
		<span>I shall send fire down on the House of Hazael</span><br />
		<span>to devour the palaces of Ben-Hadad;</span><br />
		<span>I shall break the gate-bar of Damascus,</span><br />
		<span>I shall destroy the inhabitant of Bikath-Aven,</span><br />
		<span>the holder of the sceptre in Beth-Eden,</span><br />
		<span>and the people of Aram will be deported to Kir,</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh says.</span>
	</p>

<h4>Gaza and Philistia (1:6–8)</h4>

<p>Yahweh says this:</p> 

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>For the three crimes, the four crimes of Gaza, </span><br />
		<span>I have made my decree and will not relent: </span><br />
		<span>because they have deported entire nations </span><br />
		<span>as slaves to Edom,</span><br />
		<span>I shall send fire down on the walls of Gaza </span><br />
		<span>to devour its palaces;</span><br />
		<span>I shall destroy the inhabitant of Ashdod, </span><br />
		<span>the holder of the sceptre in Ashkelon; </span><br />
		<span>I shall turn my hand against Ekron </span><br />
		<span>and the remnant of the Philistines will perish, </span><br />
		<span>says the Lord Yahweh.</span>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>For the three crimes, the four crimes of Tyre, </span><br />
		<span>I have made my decree and will not relent: </span><br />
		<span>because they have handed hosts of captives over to Edom, </span><br />

		<span>to devour its palaces.</span>

<h4>Edom (1:11–12)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>For the three crimes, the four crimes of Edom, </span><br />
		<span>I have made my decree and will not relent: </span><br />
		<span>because he has pursued his brother with the sword, </span><br />
		<span>because he has stifled any sense of pity, </span><br />
		<span>and perpetually nursed his anger </span><br />
		<span>and constantly cherished his rage,</span><br />
		<span>I shall send fire down on Teman </span><br />
		<span>to devour the palaces of Bozrah.</span>
	</p>

<h4>Ammon (1:13–15)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>For the three crimes, the four crimes of the Ammonites, </span><br />
		<span>I have made my decree and will not relent: </span><br />
		<span>because they have disembowelled the pregnant women of Gilead </span><br />
		<span>in order to extend their own frontiers,</span><br />
		<span>I shall light a fire against the walls of Rabbah </span><br />
		<span>to devour its palaces </span><br />
		<span>amid war cries on the day of battle,</span><br />
		<span>in a whirlwind on the day of storm,</span><br />
		<span>and their king shall go into captivity, </span><br />
		<span>he and his chief men with him, </span><br />
		<span>says Yahweh.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>For the three crimes, the four crimes of Moab,</span><br />
		<span>I have made my decree and will not relent:</span><br />
		<span>because they have burnt the bones of the king of Edom to ash,</span><br />
		<span>I shall send fire down into Moab</span><br />
		<span>to devour the palaces of Kerioth,</span><br />
		<span>and Moab will die in the tumult,</span><br />
		<span>amid war cries and the blare of trumpets;</span><br />
		<span>I shall destroy the ruler there</span><br />
		<span>and slaughter all the chief men there with him,</span><br />

<blockquote>
	<p class="porm">
		<span>For the three crimes, the four crimes of Judah,</span><br />
		<span>I have made my decree and will not relent:</span><br />
		<span>because they have despised Yahweh’s law</span><br />
		<span>and not kept his commandments,</span><br />
		<span>since their Falsehoods, which their ancestors followed,</span><br />
		<span>have led them astray,</span><br />
		<span>I shall send fire down on Judah</span><br />
		<span>to devour the palaces of Jerusalem.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Israel (2:6–16)</h4>

<p>Yahweh says this:</p> 

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>For the three crimes, the four crimes of Israel,</span><br />
		<span>I have made my decree and will not relent:</span><br />
		<span>because they have sold the upright for silver</span><br />
		<span>and the poor for a pair of sandals,</span><br />
		<span>because they have crushed the heads of the weak into the dust</span><br />
		<span>and thrust the rights of the oppressed to one side,</span><br />
		<span>father and son sleeping with the same girl</span><br />
		<span>and thus profaning my holy name,</span><br />
		<span>lying down beside every altar</span><br />
		<span>on clothes acquired as pledges,</span><br />
		<span>and drinking the wine of the people they have fined</span><br />
		<span>in the house of their god.</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Yet it was I who destroyed the Amorite before them,</span><br />
		<span>he who was as tall as the cedars,</span><br />
		<span>as strong as the oaks;</span><br />
		<span>I who destroyed his fruit above ground</span><br />
		<span>and his roots below.</span><br />
		<span>It was I who brought you up from Egypt</span><br />
		<span>and for forty years led you through the desert</span><br />
		<span>to take possession of the Amorite’s country;</span><br />
		<span>I who raised up prophets from your sons</span><br />
		<span>and Nazirites from your young men.</span><br />
		<span>Israelites, is this not true?</span><br />
		<span>— declares Yahweh!</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>But you have made the Nazirite drink wine</span><br />
		<span>and given orders to the prophets,</span><br />
		<span>“Do not prophesy”.</span><br />
		<span>Very well! Like a cart overloaded with sheaves</span><br />
		<span>I shall crush you where you stand;</span><br />
		<span>flight will be cut off for the swift,</span><br />
		<span>the strong will have no chance to exert his strength</span><br />
		<span>nor the warrior be able to save his life;</span><br />
		<span>the archer will not stand his ground,</span><br />
		<span>the swift of foot will not escape,</span><br />

<h4>Election and punishment (3:1–2)</h4>

<p>Listen, Israelites, to this prophecy which Yahweh pronounces against you, against the whole family which I brought up from Egypt:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>You alone have I intimately known of all the families of earth, </span><br />

<h2 id="iii">III: The Visions (7:1–9:10)</h2>

<h4>First vision: the locusts (7:1–3)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>This is what Lord Yahweh showed me:</span><br />
		<span>there was a swarm of locusts</span><br />
		<span>when the second crop was sprouting,</span><br />
		<span>full-grown locusts, after the king’s hay had been cut.</span><br />
		<span>When they had eaten all the grass in the land,</span><br />
		<span>I said, “Lord Yahweh, forgive, I beg you.</span><br />
		<span>How can Jacob survive, being so small?”.</span><br />
		<span>Then Yahweh relented;</span><br />
		<span>“It will not happen”, said Yahweh.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Second vision: the drought (7:4–6)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>This is what Lord Yahweh showed me:</span><br />
		<span>Lord Yahweh summoning fire in punishment;</span><br />
		<span>it had devoured the great Abyss</span><br />
		<span>and was encroaching on the land,</span><br />
		<span>when I said, “Lord Yahweh, stop, I beg you.</span><br />
		<span>How can Jacob survive, being so small?”.</span><br />
		<span>Then Yahweh relented;</span><br />
		<span>“This will not happen either”, said the Lord Yahweh.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Third vision: the plumb-line (7:7–9)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>This is what he showed me: </span><br />
		<span>the Lord standing by a wall, </span><br />
		<span>with a plumb-line in his hand.</span><br />
		<span>“What do you see, Amos?”, Yahweh asked me. </span><br />
		<span>“A plumb-line”, I said. </span><br />
		<span>Then the Lord said, </span><br />
		<span>“Look, I am going to put a plumb-line </span><br />
		<span>in among my people Israel; </span><br />
		<span>never again will I overlook their offences.</span><br />
		<span>The high places of Isaac will be ruined </span><br />
		<span>and the sanctuaries of Israel laid waste, </span><br />
		<span>and, sword in hand, I will attack the House of Jeroboam”.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Amaziah challenges Amos’ right to prophesy (7:10–17)</h4>

<p>Amaziah the priest of Bethel then sent word to Jeroboam king of Israel as follows, “Amos is plotting against you in the heart of the House of Israel; the country cannot tolerate his speeches. For this is what Amos says, ‘Jeroboam is going to die by the sword, and Israel will go into captivity far from its native land’”. To Amos himself Amaziah said, “Go away, seer, take yourself off to Judah, earn your living there, and there you can prophesy! But never again will you prophesy at Bethel, for this is a royal sanctuary, a national temple”. </p>

<p>“I am not a prophet”, Amos replied to Amaziah, “nor do I belong to a prophetic brotherhood. I am merely a herdsman and dresser of sycamore-figs. But Yahweh took me as I followed the flock, and Yahweh said to me, ‘Go and prophesy to my people Israel’. So now listen to what Yahweh says:</p> 

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>‘You say: Do not prophesy against Israel,</span><br />
		<span>do not foretell doom on the House of Isaac!’.</span><br />
		<span>Very well, this is what Yahweh says,</span><br />
		<span>‘Your wife will become a prostitute in the streets,</span><br />
		<span>your sons and daughters will fall by the sword,</span><br />
		<span>your land will be parcelled out by measuring line,</span><br />
		<span>and you yourself will die on polluted soil</span><br />
		<span>and Israel will go into captivity far from its own land!’”.</span>
	</p>

<h4>Fourth vision: the basket of ripe fruit (8:1–3)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>This is what Lord Yahweh showed me:</span><br />
		<span>A basket of ripe fruit.</span><br />
		<span>“What do you see, Amos?”, he asked.</span><br />
		<span>“A basket of ripe fruit”, I said.</span><br />
		<span>Then Yahweh said,</span><br />
		<span>“The time is ripe for my people Israel;</span><br />
		<span>I will not continue to overlook their offences.</span><br />
		<span>That day, the palace songs will turn to howls,</span><br />
		<span>— declares the Lord Yahweh —</span><br />
		<span>the corpses will be many that are thrown down everywhere.</span><br />
		<span>Keep silent!”.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Against swindlers and exploiters (8:4–8)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Listen to this, you who crush the needy</span><br />
		<span>and reduce the oppressed to nothing,</span><br />
		<span>you who say, “When will New Moon be over</span><br />
		<span>so that we can sell our corn,</span><br />
		<span>and Sabbath, so that we can market our wheat?</span><br />
		<span>Then, we can make the bushel-measure smaller</span><br />
		<span>and the shekel-weight bigger,</span><br />
		<span>by fraudulently tampering with the scales.</span><br />
		<span>We can buy up the weak for silver</span><br />
		<span>and the poor for a pair of sandals,</span><br />
		<span>and even get a price for the sweepings of the wheat”.</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh has sworn by the pride of Jacob,</span><br />
		<span>“Never will I forget anything they have done”.</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Will not the earth tremble for this</span><br />
		<span>and all who live on it lament,</span><br />
		<span>as it all rises together like the Nile in Egypt,</span><br />
		<span>it swells and then subsides like the Egyptian Nile?</span>

<h4>Prediction of punishment: darkness and mourning (8:9–10)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>“On that Day — declares the Lord Yahweh —</span><br />
		<span>I shall make the sun go down at noon</span><br />
		<span>and darken the earth in broad daylight.</span><br />
		<span>I shall turn your festivals into mourning</span><br />
		<span>and all your singing into lamentation;</span><br />
		<span>I shall make you all wear sacking around your waists</span><br />
		<span>and have all your heads shaved.</span><br />
		<span>I shall make it like the mourning for an only child,</span><br />
		<span>and it will end like the bitterest of days.</span>

<h4>Famine and drought of the word of God (8:11–12)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>“The days are coming — declares the Lord Yahweh —</span><br />
		<span>when I shall send a famine on the country,</span><br />
		<span>not hunger for food, not thirst for water,</span><br />
		<span>but famine for hearing Yahweh’s word.</span><br />
		<span>People will stagger from sea to sea,</span><br />
		<span>will wander from the north to the east,</span><br />
		<span>searching for Yahweh’s word,</span><br />
		<span>but will not find it.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Fresh prediction of punishment (8:13–14)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>“That Day, fine girls and stalwart youths</span><br />
		<span>will faint from thirst.</span><br />
		<span>The people who swear by the Sin of Samaria,</span><br />
		<span>who say, ‘Long live your god, Dan!’.</span><br />
		<span>and ‘Hurrah for the pilgrimage to Beersheba!’,</span><br />
		<span>will all fall, never to rise again”.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Fifth vision: the fall of the sanctuary (9:1–4)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>I saw the Lord standing by the altar, and he said,</span><br />
		<span>“Strike the top of the pillar so that the thresholds shake!</span><br />
		<span>Smash their heads in, one and all!</span><br />
		<span>And I shall put any survivors to the sword;</span><br />
		<span>whoëver runs away will not run far,</span><br />
		<span>whoëver escapes will not make good his escape.</span><br />
		<span>Should they burrow into Sheol,</span><br />
		<span>my hand will haul them out;</span><br />
		<span>should they climb to heaven,</span><br />
		<span>I shall bring them down.</span><br />
		<span>Should they hide on the top of Carmel,</span><br />
		<span>I shall track them down and catch them;</span><br />
		<span>should they hide from me on the sea bed,</span><br />
		<span>I shall order the Serpent there to bite them;</span><br />
		<span>if their enemies herd them into captivity,</span><br />
		<span>I shall order the sword to kill them there,</span><br />
		<span>and I shall fix my eyes on them</span><br />
		<span>for evil and not for good”.</span>

<h4>Doxology (9:5–6)</h4>

<v>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Lord Yahweh Sabaoth —</span><br />
		<span>he touches the earth and it melts,</span><br />
		<span>and all living things on it lament,</span><br />

<h4>Sinners will perish (9:7–10)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Are not you and the Cushites all the same to me,</span><br />
		<span>children of Israel? — declares Yahweh.</span><br />
		<span>Did I not bring Israel up from Egypt</span><br />
		<span>and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Aramaeans from Kir?</span><br />
		<span>Look, Lord Yahweh’s eyes are on the sinful kingdom,</span><br />
		<span>I shall wipe it off the face of the earth,</span><br />
		<span>although I shall not destroy the House of Jacob completely</span><br />
		<span>— declares Yahweh.</span><br />
		<span>For look, I shall give the command</span><br />
		<span>and shall shake out the House of Israel among all nations</span><br />
		<span>as a sieve is shaken out</span><br />
		<span>without one grain falling on the ground.</span><br />
		<span>All the sinners of my people will perish by the sword, who say,</span><br />
