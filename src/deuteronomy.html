<h2 id="i">Introductory Discourses (1:1–11:32)</h2>

<h3 id="ii">The First Discourse of Moses (1:1–4:43)</h3>

Deu 1:1 These are the words which Moses addressed to all Israel beyond the Jordan, in the desert, in the 
Arabah facing Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth and Dizahab. 

Deu 1 :2 It is eleven days’ journey from Horeb by way of Mount Seir to Kadesh-Barnea. 

Deu 1 :3 It was in the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, that Moses told the Israelites 
everything that Yahweh had ordered him to tell them. 

Deu 1 :4 He had defeated Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who lived 
at Ashtaroth and Edrei. 

Deu 1:5 There, in Moab beyond the Jordan, Moses resolved to expound this Law. He said: 

Deu 1:6 “Yahweh our God said to us at Horeb, ‘You have stayed long enough at this mountain. 

Deu 1:7 Move on, continue your journey, go to the highlands of the Amorites, to all those who live in the Arabah, 
in the highlands, in the lowlands, in the Negeb and in the coastland; go into Canaan and to Lebanon as far as 
the great River Euphrates. 

Deu 1:8 Look, that is the country I have given you; go and take possession of the country that Yahweh promised 
on oath to give to your ancestors, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and to their descendants after them’. 

Deu 1 :9 “At the same time, I told you, ‘I cannot be responsible for you by myself. 

Deu 1:10 Yahweh your God has increased your numbers, until you are now as numerous as the stars of 
heaven. 

Deu 1:11 And Yahweh your God is going to increase you a thousand times more, and bless you as he has 
promised you. 

Deu 1:12 So how can I cope by myself with the bitter burden that you are, and with your bickering? 

Deu 1:13 From each of your tribes pick wise, shrewd and experienced men for me to make your leaders’. 

Deu 1:14 You replied, ‘Your plan is good’. 

Deu 1:15 Sol took your tribal leaders, wise, experienced men, and appointed them to lead you, as captains of 
thousands, hundreds, fifties, tens, and as scribes for your tribes. 

Deu 1:16 At that same time I told your judges, ‘You must give your brothers a fair hearing and see justice done 
between one person and his brother or the foreigner living with him. 

Deu 1:17 You must be impartial in judgement and give an equal hearing to small and great alike. Do not be 
afraid of any human person, for the verdict is God’s. Should a case be too difficult, bring it for me to hear. 

Deu 1:18 And on that occasion I gave you instructions about everything you were to do’. 

Deu 1:19 “So, as Yahweh our God had ordered, we left Horeb and made our way through that vast and terrible 
desert, which you saw on the way to the Amorite highlands, and arrived at Kadesh-Barnea. 

Deu 1:20 I then said, ‘You have now reached the Amorite highlands, which Yahweh our God has given us. 

Deu 1 :21 Look, Yahweh your God has given you this country. March in, take possession of it as Yahweh, the 
God of your ancestors, has said; do not be afraid or discouraged’. 

Deu 1:22 Then you all came to me and said, ‘Let us send men ahead of us to explore the country; they shall 
report to us which way we ought to take and what towns we shall come to’. 

Deu 1:23 This seemed good advice to me and I selected twelve men from among you, one from each tribe. 

Deu 1:24 These men made towards the highlands and went up into them; they reached the Valley of Eshcol and 



reconnoitred it. 

Deu 1:25 They collected some of the produce of the country and brought it down to us; and they made us this 
report, ‘Yahweh our God has given us a fine country’. 

Deu 1:26 You, however, refused to go up there and rebelled against the voice of Yahweh your God. 

Deu 1 :27 You muttered in your tents, saying, ‘Yahweh hates us, and that is why he has brought us out of Egypt, 

to put us into the Amorites’ power and so destroy us. 

Deu 1:28 What kind of place are we making for? Our brothers have discouraged us by saying that the people 
are stronger and taller than we are, the cities immense, with walls reaching to the sky. And we have seen 
Anakim there too’. 

Deu 1:29 “And I said to you, ‘Do not take fright, do not be afraid of them. 

Deu 1 :30 Yahweh your God goes ahead of you and will be fighting on your side, just as you saw him act in 

Egypt. 

Deu 1 :31 You have seen him in the desert too: Yahweh your God continued to support you, as a man supports 
his son, all along the road you followed until you arrived here’. 

Deu 1 :32 But for all this, you put no faith in Yahweh your God, 

Deu 1 :33 going ahead of you on the journey to find you a camping ground, by night in the fire to light your path, 
and in the cloud by day. 

Deu 1:34 “Yahweh heard what you were saying and in his anger swore this oath, 

Deu 1:35 ‘Not one of these people, this perverse generation, will see the fine country I swore to give your 
ancestors, 

Deu 1 :36 except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He will see it. To him and to his children I shall give the land he has 
set foot on, for he has been perfectly obedient to Yahweh’. 

Deu 1 :37 Yahweh was angry with me too, because of you. ‘You will not go in either’, he said. 

Deu 1 :38 ‘Your assistant, Joshua son of Nun, will be the one to enter. Encourage him, since he is to bring Israel 
into possession of the country. 

Deu 1:39 And your little ones too, who, you said, would be seized as booty, these children of yours who do not 
yet know good from evil, they will go in; I shall give it to them and they will own it. 

Deu 1 :40 But, as regards yourselves, turn round, go back into the desert, towards the Sea of Suph’. 

Deu 1 :41 “In reply, you then said to me, ‘We have sinned against Yahweh our God. We shall go up and fight just 
as Yahweh our God has ordered us’. And each one of you buckled on his arms and equipped himself to march 
up into the highlands. 

Deu 1 :42 But Yahweh said to me, ‘Tell them this: Do not go up and fight. I am not with you. Do not let 
yourselves be defeated by your enemies’. 

Deu 1 :43 So I told you, but you would not listen, and you rebelled against the voice of Yahweh; presumptuously 
you marched into the highlands. 

Deu 1:44 The Amorites, who live in that country of hills, came swarming out against you like bees, pursued you 
and beat you from Seir to Hormah. 

Deu 1:45 On your return, you wept in Yahweh’s presence, but he would not listen to your cries or pay attention. 
Deu 1 :46 That was why you had to stay at Kadesh as long as you did”. 

Deu 2:1 “We then turned round and made for the desert, in the direction of the Sea of Suph, as Yahweh had 
ordered me. For many days we skirted Mount Seir. 

Deu 2:2 Yahweh then said to me, 

Deu 2:3 ‘You have gone far enough round this mountain; now turn north. 

Deu 2:4 And give the people this order: You are about to pass through the territory of your kinsmen, the sons of 
Esau who live in Seir. They are afraid of you, and you will be well protected. 

Deu 2:5 Do not provoke them, for I shall give you none of their land, no, not so much as a foot’s length of it. I 
have given the highlands of Seir to Esau as his domain. 

Deu 2:6 Pay them in money for what food you eat; and pay them in money for the water you drink. 

Deu 2:7 Yahweh your God has blessed you in all you do; he has watched over your journeying through this vast 
desert. Yahweh your God has been with you these forty years and you have never been in want’. 

Deu 2:8 “So we passed beyond those relatives of ours, the children of Esau who live in Seir, by the road through 
the Arabah, Elath and Ezion-Geber; then, changing direction, we took the road towards the Plains of Moab. 

Deu 2:9 Yahweh then said to me, ‘Do not attack Moab, do not provoke him to fight, for I shall give you none of 
his land, since I have given Ar to the children of Lot as their domain’. 

Deu 2:10 (At one time the Emim lived there, a great and numerous people, tall as the Anakim; 

Deu 2:1 1 and, like the Anakim, they were considered to be Rephaim, though the Moabites call them Emim. 

Deu 2:12 The Horites, too, lived in Seir at one time; these, however, were dispossessed and exterminated by 
the children of Esau who settled there in place of them, just as Israel has done in the country given to it by 
Yahweh as a heritage.) 



Deu 2:13 ‘On your way, then! Cross the Wadi Zered!’. “And so we crossed the Wadi Zered. 

Deu 2:14 From Kadesh-Barnea to the crossing of the Wadi Zered our wanderings had taken thirty-eight years; 
as a result of which, the entire generation of those of age to bear arms had been eliminated, as Yahweh had 
sworn to them. 

Deu 2:15 Yahweh’s hand had been against them, to eliminate them completely from the camp. 

Deu 2:16 “When death had carried off from the people those of age to bear arms, to the last man, 

Deu 2:17 Yahweh said this to me, 

Deu 2:18 ‘You are now crossing Ar, the country of Moab, 

Deu 2:19 and soon you will encounter the children of Ammon. Do not attack them, do not provoke them, for I 
shall give you none of the land belonging to the children of Ammon as your domain. I have given it to the 
children of Lot as theirs’. 

Deu 2:20 (This used also to be considered as Rephaim territory; at one time the Rephaim lived there, though 
the Ammonites call them Zamzummim, 

Deu 2:21 a great and numerous people, and tall like the Anakim. Yahweh exterminated them for the Ammonites 
who dispossessed them and settled there in place of them, 

Deu 2:22 just as he had done for the children of Esau who live in Seir, so that they dispossessed the Horites 
and settled there instead of them and are still there now. 

Deu 2:23 It was the same with the Avvites who occupied encampments as far as Gaza: the Caphtorim, coming 
from Caphtor, exterminated them and settled there instead.) 

Deu 2:24 ‘On your way! Break camp and cross the Wadi Arnon. See, I am putting Sihon the Amorite, king of 
Heshbon, at your mercy, and his country too. Set about the conquest; engage him in battle. 

Deu 2:25 Today and henceforth, I shall fill the peoples under all heaven with fear and terror of you; whoëver 
hears word of your approach will tremble and writhe in anguish because of you’. 

Deu 2:26 “So, from the desert of Kedemoth I sent envoys to Sihon king of Heshbon with this peaceful message, 
Deu 2:27 ‘I intend to cross your country. I shall go my way, straying neither to right nor to left. 

Deu 2:28 I shall eat and pay for the food you choose to sell me, and I shall drink and pay for the water you let 
me have. I only want to march through, 

Deu 2:29 just as the children of Esau who live in Seir permitted, as well as the Moabites who live in Ar, until I 
cross the Jordan into the country that Yahweh our God is giving us’. 

Deu 2:30 “But Sihon king of Heshbon would not give us leave to pass through his territory; Yahweh our God had 
made his spirit obstinate and his heart stubborn, to put him at your mercy, as he still is. 

Deu 2:31 Yahweh said to me, ‘You see, I am starting to give you Sihon and his country. Begin the conquest by 
seizing his country’. 

Deu 2:32 Sihon marched out against us, he and all his people, to give battle at Jahaz. 

Deu 2:33 And Yahweh our God handed him over to us: we defeated him and his sons and all his people. 

Deu 2:34 We captured all his towns and laid all these towns under the curse of destruction: men, women and 
children, we left no survivors 

Deu 2:35 except the livestock which we took as our booty, and the spoils of the captured towns. 

Deu 2:36 From Aroer on the edge of the Arnon valley and from the town down in the valley, as far as Gilead, not 
one town was beyond our reach; Yahweh our God delivered them all to us. 

Deu 2:37 You did not, however, go near the country of the Ammonites, or the region of the River Jabbok, or the 
towns in the highlands, or anywhere forbidden us by Yahweh our God”. 

Deu 3:1 “We then turned on Bashan and invaded that. And Og king of Bashan marched out against us, he and 
all his people, to give battle at Edrei. 

Deu 3:2 Yahweh said to me, ‘Do not be afraid of him, for I have put him at your mercy, him, all his people and 
his country. You will treat him as you treated Sihon king of the Amorites who lived in Heshbon’. 

Deu 3:3 So, Yahweh our God put Og king of Bashan at our mercy too, with all his people. We beat him so 
thoroughly that nobody was left. 

Deu 3:4 That was when we captured all his towns; there was not a town of theirs we did not take: sixty towns, 
the whole confederation of Argob, Og’s kingdom in Bashan, 

Deu 3:5 all of them fortresses defended by high walls and fortified with gates and bars, not to mention the 
Perizzite towns, which were very numerous. 

Deu 3:6 We laid them under the curse of destruction as we had done Sihon king of Heshbon, laying all these 

towns under the curse of destruction: men, women and children- 

Deu 3:7 but we seized the livestock and spoils of the towns as booty for ourselves. 

Deu 3:8 “Thus, by then we had taken the country of the two Amorite kings beyond the Jordan, stretching from 
the Wadi Arnon to Mount Hermon 

Deu 3:9 (the Sidonians call Hermon “Sirion” and the Amorites call it “Senir'): 

Deu 3:10 all the towns of the tableland, all Gilead, and all Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei, the capital cities 



of Og in Bashan. 

Deu 3:11 (Og king of Bashan was the last survivor of the Rephaim; his bed was the iron bed that can be seen at 
Rabbah-of-the-Ammonites, nine cubits long and four wide, according to the human cubit.) 

Deu 3:12 Then we took possession of this country, from Aroer on the Wadi Arnon. To the Reubenites and 
Gadites I gave half the highlands of Gilead with its towns. 

Deu 3:13 To the half-tribe of Manasseh I gave the rest of Gilead and the whole of Bashan, Og’s kingdom. (The 
whole confederation of Argob and the whole of Bashan is called the country of the Rephaim. 

Deu 3:14 Since Jair son of Manasseh occupied the whole confederation of Argob as far as the frontiers of the 
Geshurites and Maacathites, after him Bashan is called the Encampments of Jair even today.) 

Deu 3:15 To Machir I gave Gilead. 

Deu 3:16 To the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the region from Gilead to the Wadi Arnon, the middle of the 
ravine marking the boundary, and up as far as the Jabbok, the ravine marking the frontier of the Ammonites. 

Deu 3:17 The Arabah and the Jordan serve as frontiers from Chinnereth down to the Sea of the Arabah (the 
Salt Sea), at the foot of the slopes of Pisgah on the east. 

Deu 3:18 “I then gave you this order: ‘Yahweh your God has given you this country to be yours. Armed, every 
one of you fit to fight must go ahead of your brothers the Israelites. 

Deu 3:19 Only your wives, your children and your flocks (you have many flocks, I know) must stay behind in the 
towns which I have given you, 

Deu 3:20 until Yahweh has brought your brothers to rest as he has already brought you, and they too possess 
the territory which Yahweh your God is giving them on the other side of the Jordan; after that, you can go home, 
each to the domain I have given you’. 

Deu 3:21 I then gave Joshua this order, ‘You can see for yourself everything that Yahweh our God has done to 
these two kings; Yahweh will do the same to all the kingdoms through which you pass. 

Deu 3:22 Do not be afraid of them: Yahweh your God himself is fighting for you’. 

Deu 3:23 “I then pleaded with Yahweh. 

Deu 3:24 ‘My Lord Yahweh’, I said, ‘now that you have begun to reveal your greatness and your power to your 
servant with works and mighty deeds no God in heaven or on earth can rival, 

Deu 3:25 may I not go across and see this fine country on the other side of the Jordan, that fine upland country 
and the Lebanon?’. 

Deu 3:26 But, because of you, Yahweh was angry with me and would not listen. ‘Enough!’. he said, ‘Do not 
mention this subject again! 

Deu 3:27 Climb to the top of Pisgah; turn your eyes to the west, the north, the south, the east. Look well, for 
across this Jordan you shall not go. 

Deu 3:28 Give Joshua your instructions; encourage him, strengthen him; for he will be the one to cross at the 
head of this people; he will be the one to bring them into possession of the country which you will see’. 

Deu 3:29 “We then stayed in the valley, close to Beth-Peor”. 

Deu 4:1 “And now, Israel, listen to the laws and customs which I am teaching you today, so that, by observing 
them, you may survive to enter and take possession of the country which Yahweh, God of your ancestors, is 
giving you. 

Deu 4:2 You must add nothing to what I command you, and take nothing from it, but keep the commandments 
of Yahweh your God just as I lay them down for you. 

Deu 4:3 You can see for yourselves what Yahweh has done about the Baal of Peor; Yahweh your God has 
destroyed all those of you who followed the Baal of Peor; 

Deu 4:4 but those of you who stayed faithful to Yahweh your God are all alive today. 

Deu 4:5 Look: as Yahweh my God commanded me, I have taught you laws and customs, for you to observe in 
the country of which you are going to take possession. 

Deu 4:6 Keep them, put them into practice, and other peoples will admire your wisdom and prudence. Once 
they know what all these laws are, they will exclaim, ‘No other people is as wise and prudent as this great 
nation!’. 

Deu 4:7 And indeed, what great nation has its gods as near as Yahweh our God is to us whenever we call to 
him? 

Deu 4:8 And what great nation has laws and customs as upright as the entirety of this Law which I am laying 
down for you today? 

Deu 4:9 “But take care, as you value your lives! Do not forget the things which you yourselves have seen, or let 
them slip from your heart as long as you live; teach them, rather, to your children and to your children’s children. 
Deu 4:10 The day you stood at Horeb in the presence of Yahweh your God, Yahweh said to me, ‘Summon the 
people to me; I want them to hear me speaking, so that they will learn to fear me all the days they live on earth, 
and teach this to their children’. 

Deu 4:1 1 So you came and stood at the foot of the mountain, and the mountain flamed to the very sky, a sky 



darkened by cloud, murky and thunderous. 

Deu 4:12 Yahweh then spoke to you from the heart of the fire; you heard the sound of words but saw no shape; 
there was only a voice. 

Deu 4:13 He revealed his covenant to you and commanded you to observe it, the Ten Words which he inscribed 
on two tablets of stone. 

Deu 4:14 Yahweh then ordered me to teach you the laws and customs that you were to observe in the country 
into which you are about to cross, to take possession of it. 

Deu 4:15 “Hence, be very careful what you do. Since you saw no shape that day at Horeb when Yahweh spoke 
to you from the heart of the fire, 

Deu 4:16 see that you do not corrupt yourselves by making an image in the shape of anything whatever: be it 
statue of man or of woman, 

Deu 4:17 or of any animal on the earth, or of any bird that flies in the heavens, 

Deu 4:18 or of any reptile that crawls on the ground, or of any fish in the waters under the earth. 

Deu 4:19 When you raise your eyes to heaven, when you see the sun, the moon, the stars — the entire array of 
heaven — do not be tempted to worship them and serve them. Yahweh your God has allotted these to all the 
other peoples under heaven, 

Deu 4:20 but Yahweh has chosen you, bringing you out of the iron-foundry, Egypt, to be his own people, his 
own people as you still are today. 

Deu 4:21 “Yahweh is angry with me because of you; he has sworn that I shall not cross the Jordan or enter the 
fine country which Yahweh your God is giving you as your heritage. 

Deu 4:22 Yes, I am to die in this country; I shall not cross this Jordan; you will go over and take possession of 
that rich land. 

Deu 4:23 Be careful not to forget the covenant which Yahweh your God has made with you, by sculpting an 
image or making a statue of anything, since Yahweh your God has forbidden this; 

Deu 4:24 for Yahweh your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God. 

Deu 4:25 “When you have fathered children and grandchildren and have grown old in the country, when you 
have grown corrupt and made some image, doing what Yahweh regards as wrong and so provoking his anger- 
Deu 4:26 today I call heaven and earth to witness against you — you will quickly vanish from the country which 
you are crossing the Jordan to possess. Your days will not be prolonged there, for you will be utterly destroyed. 
Deu 4:27 Yahweh will scatter you among the peoples, and only a small number of you will remain among the 
nations where Yahweh will have driven you. 

Deu 4:28 There you will serve gods made by human hand, of wood and of stone, that cannot see or hear, eat or 
smell. 

Deu 4:29 “If, however, from there you start searching once more for Yahweh your God, and if you search for him 
honestly and sincerely, you will find him. 

Deu 4:30 You will suffer; everything I have said will befall you, but in the final days you will return to Yahweh 
your God and listen to his voice. 

Deu 4:31 For Yahweh your God is a merciful God and will not desert or destroy you or forget the covenant 
which he made on oath with your ancestors. 

Deu 4:32 “Put this question, then, to the ages that are past, that have gone before you, from when God created 
the human race on earth: Was there ever a word so majestic, from one end of heaven to the other? Was 
anything like it ever heard? 

Deu 4:33 Did ever a people hear the voice of the living God speaking from the heart of the fire, as you have 
heard it, and remain alive? 

Deu 4:34 Has it ever been known before that any god took action himself to bring one nation out of another one, 
by ordeals, signs, wonders, war with mighty hand and outstretched arm, by fearsome terrors — all of which things 
Yahweh your God has done for you before your eyes in Egypt? 

Deu 4:35 “This he showed you, so that you might know that Yahweh is the true God and that there is no other. 
Deu 4:36 To instruct you, he made you hear his voice from heaven, and on earth he let you see his great fire, 
and from the heart of the fire you heard his words. 

Deu 4:37 Because he loved your ancestors and, after them, chose their descendants, he has brought you out of 
Egypt, displaying his presence and mighty power, 

Deu 4:38 dispossessing for you nations who were larger and stronger than you, to make way for you and to give 
you their country as your heritage, as it still is today. 

Deu 4:39 “Hence, grasp this today and meditate on it carefully: Yahweh is the true God, in heaven above as on 
earth beneath, he and no other. 

Deu 4:40 Keep his laws and commandments as I give them to you today, so that you and your children after 
you may prosper and live long in the country that Yahweh your God is giving you for ever”. 

Deu 4:41 Moses then set aside three towns in the east, beyond the Jordan, 



Deu 4:42 to which any killer might flee who had accidentally, without any previous feud, killed his fellow; by 
taking refuge in one of these towns he could save his life. 

Deu 4:43 These were, for the Reubenites, Bezer in the desert on the tableland; for the Gadites, Ramoth in 
Gilead; for the Manassehites, Golan in Bashan. 

Deu 4:44 This is the Law which Moses presented to the Israelites. 

Deu 4:45 These are the stipulations, the laws and the customs which Moses gave the Israelites after they had 
left Egypt, 

Deu 4:46 beyond the Jordan in the valley near Beth-Peor, in the country of Sihon the Amorite king who had 
lived at Heshbon. Moses and the Israelites had defeated him when they left Egypt, 

Deu 4:47 and had taken possession of his country, as well as that of Og king of Bashan — two Amorite kings to 
the east beyond the Jordan, 

Deu 4:48 from Aroer on the edge of the Arnon Valley, all the way to Mount Sion (that is, Hermon) - 

Deu 4:49 and of the whole Arabah east of the Jordan as far as the Sea of the Arabah, at the foot of the slopes 

of Pisgah. 

Deu 5:1 Moses called all Israel together and said to them, “Listen, Israel, to the laws and customs that I proclaim 
to you today. Learn them and take care to observe them. 

Deu 5:2 “Yahweh our God made a covenant with us at Horeb. 

Deu 5:3 Yahweh made this covenant not with our ancestors, but with us, with all of us alive here today. 

Deu 5:4 On the mountain, from the heart of the fire, Yahweh spoke to you face to face, 

Deu 5:5 while I stood between you and Yahweh to let you know what Yahweh was saying, since you were afraid 
of the fire and had not gone up the mountain. He said: 

Deu 5:6 “‘I am Yahweh your God who brought you out of Egypt, out of the place of slave-labour. 

Deu 5:7 “‘You will have no gods other than me. 

Deu 5:8 “‘You must not make yourselves any image or any likeness of anything in heaven above or on earth 
beneath or in the waters under the earth; 

Deu 5:9 you must not bow down to these gods or serve them. For I, Yahweh your God, am a jealous God and I 
punish the parents’ fault in the children, the grandchildren and the great-grandchildren, among those who hate 
me; 

Deu 5:10 but I show faithful love to thousands, to those who love me and keep my commandments. 

Deu 5:1 1 “‘You must not misuse the name of Yahweh your God, for Yahweh will not leave unpunished anyone 
who uses his name for what is false. 

Deu 5:12 “‘Observe the Sabbath day and keep it holy, as Yahweh your God has commanded you. 

Deu 5:13 Labour for six days, doing all your work, 

Deu 5:14 but the seventh day is a Sabbath for Yahweh your God. You must not do any work that day, neither 
you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your servants — male or female — nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor 
any of your animals, nor the foreigner who has made his home with you; 

Deu 5:15 so that your servants, male and female, may rest, as you do. Remember that you were once a slave in 
Egypt, and that Yahweh your God brought you out of there with mighty hand and outstretched arm; this is why 
Yahweh your God has commanded you to keep the Sabbath day. 

Deu 5:16 “‘Honour your father and your mother, as Yahweh your God has commanded you, so that you may 
have long life and may prosper in the country which Yahweh your God is giving you. 

Deu 5:17 “‘You must not kill. 

Deu 5:18 “‘You must not commit adultery. 

Deu 5:19 “‘You must not steal. 

Deu 5:20 “‘You must not give false evidence against your fellow. 

Deu 5:21 “‘You must not set your heart on your neighbour’s spouse, you must not set your heart on your 
neighbour’s house, or field, or servant-man or woman — or ox, or donkey or any of your neighbour’s 
possessions’. 

Deu 5:22 “These were the words Yahweh spoke to you when you were all assembled on the mountain. 
Thunderously, he spoke to you from the heart of the fire, in cloud and thick darkness. He added nothing, but 
wrote them on two tablets of stone which he gave to me. 

Deu 5:23 “Now, having heard this voice coming out of the darkness, while the mountain was all on fire, you 
came to me, all of you, heads of tribes and elders, 

Deu 5:24 and said, ‘Yahweh our God has shown us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice 
from the heart of the fire. Today we have seen that God can speak with a human being and that person still live. 
Deu 5:25 So why should we expose ourselves to death again? For this great fire might devour us if we go on 
listening to the voice of Yahweh our God, and then we should die. 

Deu 5:26 For what creature of flesh could possibly live after hearing, as we have heard, the voice of the living 
God speaking from the heart of the fire? 



Deu 5:27 Go nearer yourself and listen to everything that Yahweh our God may say, and then tell us everything 
that Yahweh our God has told you; we shall listen and put it into practice!’. 

Deu 5:28 “Yahweh heard what you were saying to me, and he then said to me, ‘I have heard what these people 
are saying. Everything they have said is well said. 

Deu 5:29 If only their heart were always so, set on fearing me and on keeping my commandments, so that they 
and their children might prosper for ever! 

Deu 5:30 Go and tell them to go back to their tents. 

Deu 5:31 But you yourself stay here with me, and I shall tell you all the commandments, the laws and the 
customs which you are to teach them and which they are to observe in the country which I am giving them as 
their possession’. 

Deu 5:32 “Keep them and put them into practice: such is Yahweh’s command to you. Stray neither to right nor to 
left. 

Deu 5:33 Follow the whole way that Yahweh has marked for you, and you will survive to prosper and live long in 
the country which you are going to possess”. 

Deu 6:1 “Such, then, are the commandments, the laws and the customs which Yahweh your God has instructed 
me to teach you, for you to observe in the country which you are on your way to possess. 

Deu 6:2 And hence, if, throughout your lives, you fear Yahweh your God and keep all his laws and 
commandments, which I am laying down for you today, you will live long, you and your child and your grandchild. 
Deu 6:3 Listen then, Israel, keep and observe what will make you prosperous and numerous, as Yahweh, God 
of your ancestors, has promised you, in giving you a country flowing with milk and honey. 

Deu 6:4 “Listen, Israel: Yahweh our God is the one, the only Yahweh. 

Deu 6:5 You must love Yahweh your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength. 

Deu 6:6 Let the words I enjoin on you today stay in your heart. 

Deu 6:7 You shall tell them to your children, and keep on telling them, when you are sitting at home, when you 
are out and about, when you are lying down and when you are standing up; 

Deu 6:8 you must fasten them on your hand as a sign and on your forehead as a headband; 

Deu 6:9 you must write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates. 

Deu 6:10 “When Yahweh has brought you into the country which he swore to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac 
and Jacob that he would give you, with great and prosperous cities you have not built, 

Deu 6:1 1 with houses full of good things you have not provided, with wells you have not dug, with vineyards and 
olive trees you have not planted, and then, when you have eaten as much as you want, 

Deu 6:12 be careful you do not forget Yahweh who has brought you out of Egypt, out of the place of slave- 
labour. 

Deu 6:13 Yahweh your God is the one you must fear, him alone you must serve, his is the name by which you 
must swear. 

Deu 6:14 “Do not follow other gods, gods of the peoples round you, 

Deu 6:15 for Yahweh your God among you is a jealous God; the wrath of Yahweh your God would blaze out 
against you, and he would wipe you off the face of the earth. 

Deu 6:16 Do not put Yahweh your God to the test as you tested him at Massah. 

Deu 6:17 Keep the commandments of Yahweh your God, and his instructions and laws which he has laid down 
for you, 

Deu 6:18 and do what Yahweh regards as right and good, so that you may prosper and take possession of the 
fine country which Yahweh swore to give your ancestors, 

Deu 6:19 driving out your enemies before you; such was Yahweh’s promise. 

Deu 6:20 “In times to come, when your child asks you, ‘What is the meaning of these instructions, laws and 
customs which Yahweh our God has laid down for you?’. 

Deu 6:21 you are to tell your child, ‘Once we were Pharaoh’s slaves in Egypt, and Yahweh brought us out of 
Egypt by his mighty hand. 

Deu 6:22 Before our eyes, Yahweh worked great and terrible signs and wonders against Egypt, against 
Pharaoh and his entire household. 

Deu 6:23 And he brought us out of there, to lead us into the country which he had sworn to our ancestors that 
he would give us. 

Deu 6:24 And Yahweh has commanded us to observe all these laws and to fear Yahweh our God, so as to be 
happy for ever and to survive, as we do to this day. 

Deu 6:25 For us, right living will mean this: to keep and observe all these commandments in obedience to 
Yahweh our God, as he has commanded us’”. 

Deu 7:1 “When Yahweh your God has brought you into the country which you are going to make your own, 
many nations will fall before you: Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites, 
seven nations greater and stronger than yourselves. 



Deu 7:2 Yahweh your God will put them at your mercy and you will conquer them. You must put them under the 
curse of destruction. You must not make any treaty with them or show them any pity. 

Deu 7:3 You must not intermarry with them; you must not give a daughter of yours to a son of theirs, or take a 
daughter of theirs for a son of yours, 

Deu 7:4 for your son would be seduced from following me into serving other gods; the wrath of Yahweh would 
blaze out against you and he would instantly destroy you. 

Deu 7:5 Instead, treat them like this: tear down their altars, smash their standing-stones, cut down their sacred 
poles and burn their idols. 

Deu 7:6 For you are a people consecrated to Yahweh your God; of all the peoples on earth, you have been 
chosen by Yahweh your God to be his own people. 

Deu 7:7 “Yahweh set his heart on you and chose you not because you were the most numerous of all peoples — 
for indeed you were the smallest of all- 

Deu 7:8 but because he loved you and meant to keep the oath which he swore to your ancestors: that was why 
Yahweh brought you out with his mighty hand and redeemed you from the place of slave-labour, from the power 
of Pharaoh king of Egypt. 

Deu 7:9 From this you can see that Yahweh your God is the true God, the faithful God who, though he is true to 
his covenant and his faithful love for a thousand generations as regards those who love him and keep his 
commandments, 

Deu 7:10 punishes in their own persons those that hate him. He destroys anyone who hates him, without delay; 
and it is in their own persons that he punishes them. 

Deu 7:1 1 Hence, you must keep and observe the commandments, laws and customs which I am laying down 
for you today. 

Deu 7:12 “Listen to these ordinances, be true to them and observe them, and in return Yahweh your God will be 
true to the covenant and love which he promised on oath to your ancestors. 

Deu 7:13 He will love you and bless you and increase your numbers; he will bless the fruit of your body and the 
produce of your soil, your corn, your new wine, your oil, the issue of your cattle, the young of your flock, in the 
country which he swore to your ancestors that he would give you. 

Deu 7:14 You will be the most blessed of all peoples. None of you, man or woman, will be sterile, no male or 
female of your beasts infertile. 

Deu 7:15 Yahweh will deflect all illness from you; he will not afflict you with those evil plagues of Egypt which 
you have known, but will inflict them on all who hate you. 

Deu 7:16 “So, devour all the peoples whom Yahweh your God puts at your mercy, show them no pity, do not 
serve their gods: or you will be ensnared. 

Deu 7:17 “You may say in your heart, ‘These nations outnumber me; how shall I be able to dispossess them?’. 
Deu 7:18 Do not be afraid of them: remember how Yahweh your God treated Pharaoh and all Egypt, 

Deu 7:19 the great ordeals that you yourselves have seen, the signs and wonders, the mighty hand and 
outstretched arm with which Yahweh your God brought you out. This is how Yahweh your God will treat all the 
peoples whom you fear to face. 

Deu 7:20 And what is more, Yahweh your God will send hornets to destroy those who are left and who hide 
from you. 

Deu 7:21 “Do not be afraid of them, for Yahweh your God is among you, a great and terrible God. 

Deu 7:22 Little by little, Yahweh your God will clear away these nations before you; you cannot destroy them all 
at once, or wild animals will breed and be disastrous for you. 

Deu 7:23 But Yahweh your God will put them at your mercy, and disaster after disaster will overtake them until 
they are finally destroyed. 

Deu 7:24 He will put their kings at your mercy and you will blot out their names under heaven; no one will be 
able to resist you — until you have destroyed them all. 

Deu 7:25 “You must burn the statues of their gods, not coveting the gold and silver that covers them; take it and 
you will be caught in a snare: it is detestable to Yahweh your God. 

Deu 7:26 You must not bring any detestable thing into your house: or you, like it, will come under the curse of 
destruction. You must regard them as unclean and loathsome, for they are under the curse of destruction”. 

Deu 8:1 “You must keep and put into practice all the commandments which I enjoin on you today, so that you 
may survive and increase in numbers and enter the country which Yahweh promised on oath to your ancestors, 
and make it your own. 

Deu 8:2 Remember the long road by which Yahweh your God led you for forty years in the desert, to humble 
you, to test you and know your inmost heart — whether you would keep his commandments or not. 

Deu 8:3 He humbled you, he made you feel hunger, he fed you with manna which neither you nor your 
ancestors had ever known, to make you understand that human beings live not on bread alone but on every 
word that comes from the mouth of Yahweh. 



Deu 8:4 The clothes on your back did not wear out and your feet were not swollen, all those forty years. 

Deu 8:5 “Learn from this that Yahweh your God was training you as a man trains his child, 

Deu 8:6 and keep the commandments of Yahweh your God, and so follow his ways and fear him. 

Deu 8:7 “But Yahweh your God is bringing you into a fine country, a land of streams and springs, of waters that 
well up from the deep in valleys and hills, 

Deu 8:8 a land of wheat and barley, of vines, of figs, of pomegranates, a land of olives, of oil, of honey, 

Deu 8:9 a land where you will eat bread without stint, where you will want nothing, a land where the stones are 
iron and where the hills may be quarried for copper. 

Deu 8:10 You will eat and have all you want and you will bless Yahweh your God in the fine country which he 
has given you. 

Deu 8:11 “Be careful not to forget Yahweh your God, by neglecting his commandments, customs and laws 
which I am laying down for you today. 

Deu 8:12 When you have eaten all you want, when you have built fine houses to live in, 

Deu 8:13 when you have seen your flocks and herds increase, your silver and gold abound and all your 
possessions grow great, 

Deu 8:14 do not become proud of heart. Do not then forget Yahweh your God who brought you out of Egypt, out 
of the place of slave-labour, 

Deu 8:15 who guided you through this vast and dreadful desert, a land of fiery snakes, scorpions, thirst; 

Deu 8:16 who in this waterless place brought you water out of the flinty rock; who in this desert fed you with 
manna unknown to your ancestors, to humble you and test you and so make your future the happier. 

Deu 8:17 “Beware of thinking to yourself, ‘My own strength and the might of my own hand have given me the 
power to act like this’. 

Deu 8:18 Remember Yahweh your God; he was the one who gave you the strength to act effectively like this, 
thus keeping then, as today, the covenant which he swore to your ancestors. 

Deu 8:19 Be sure: if you forget Yahweh your God, if you follow other gods, if you serve them and bow down to 
them — 1 testify to you today — you will perish. 

Deu 8:20 Like the nations Yahweh is to destroy before you, so you yourselves will perish, for not having listened 
to the voice of Yahweh your God”. 

Deu 9:1 “Listen, Israel; today you are about to cross the Jordan, to go and dispossess nations greater and 
stronger than yourself, and cities immense, with walls reaching to the sky. 

Deu 9:2 A people great and tall, these Anakim, as you know; you have heard the saying: Who can stand up to 
the sons of Anak? 

Deu 9:3 Know then today that Yahweh your God himself will go ahead of you, destroying them like a devouring 
fire, and that he himself will subdue them before you so that you can dispossess and quickly make an end of 
them, as Yahweh has already said. 

Deu 9:4 Do not think to yourself, once Yahweh your God has driven them before you, ‘Yahweh has brought me 
into possession of this country because I am upright’, when Yahweh is dispossessing these nations for you, 
because they do wrong. 

Deu 9:5 You are not going into their country to take possession because of any right behaviour or uprightness 
on your part; rather, it is because of their wickedness that Yahweh is dispossessing these nations for you, and 
also to keep the pact which he swore to your ancestors, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. 

Deu 9:6 Be clear about this: Yahweh is not giving you possession of this fine country because of any right 
conduct on your part, for you are an obstinate people. 

Deu 9:7 “Remember; never forget how you provoked Yahweh your God in the desert. From the very day that 
you left Egypt until you arrived here, you have been rebels against Yahweh. 

Deu 9:8 At Horeb, you provoked Yahweh, and Yahweh was so angry with you that he was ready to destroy you. 
Deu 9:9 I had gone up the mountain to receive the stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant that Yahweh was 
making with you. I stayed forty days and forty nights on the mountain, with nothing to eat or drink. 

Deu 9:10 Yahweh gave me the two stone tablets inscribed by the finger of God, exactly corresponding to what 
Yahweh had said to you on the mountain, from the heart of the fire, on the day of the Assembly. 

Deu 9:1 1 After forty days and forty nights, having given me the two stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant, 
Deu 9:12 Yahweh said to me, ‘Get up, go down quickly, for your people, whom you have brought out of Egypt, 
are corrupting one another. They have been quick to leave the way I marked out for them; they have cast 
themselves a metal idol’. 

Deu 9:13 Yahweh then said to me, ‘I have seen this people, and what an obstinate people they are! 

Deu 9:14 Leave me, I am going to destroy them and wipe out their name under heaven; and I shall make you 
into a mightier and more numerous nation than they are!’. 

Deu 9:15 “I went back down the mountain, which was blazing with fire, and in my hands were the two tablets of 
the covenant. 



Deu 9:16 When I looked, I saw that you had been sinning against Yahweh your God. You had cast yourselves a 
metal calf; you had been quick to leave the way marked out for you by Yahweh. 

Deu 9:17 I seized the two tablets and with my two hands threw them down and broke them before your eyes. 
Deu 9:18 Then I fell prostrate before Yahweh; as before, I spent forty days and forty nights with nothing to eat or 
drink, on account of all the sins which you had committed, by doing what was displeasing to Yahweh and thus 
arousing his anger. 

Deu 9:19 For I was afraid of this anger, of the fury which so roused Yahweh against you that he was ready to 
destroy you. And, once again, Yahweh heard my prayer. 

Deu 9:20 Yahweh was enraged with Aaron and was ready to destroy him too; I also pleaded for Aaron on that 
occasion. 

Deu 9:21 That work of sin, the calf you had made, I took and burned and broke to pieces; having ground it to the 
finest dust, I threw its dust into the stream that comes down from the mountain. 

Deu 9:22 “At Taberah too and at Massah and Kibroth-ha-Taavah, you provoked Yahweh. 

Deu 9:23 And when Yahweh, meaning you to leave Kadesh-Barnea, said, ‘Go up and take possession of the 
country which I have given you’, you rebelled against the command of Yahweh your God and would not believe 
him or listen to his voice. 

Deu 9:24 You have been rebels against Yahweh from the day he first knew you. 

Deu 9:25 “So I fell prostrate before Yahweh and lay there those forty days and forty nights, Yahweh having said 
that he was going to destroy you. 

Deu 9:26 And I pleaded with Yahweh. ‘My Lord Yahweh’, I said, ‘do not destroy your people, your heritage 
whom in your greatness you have redeemed, whom you have brought out of Egypt with your mighty hand. 

Deu 9:27 Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; take no notice of this people’s stubbornness, 
their wickedness, and their sin, 

Deu 9:28 so that, in the country from which you have brought us, it may not be said, “Yahweh was not able to 
bring them to the country which he had promised them. He hated them; that was why he brought them out — to 
slaughter them in the desert”. 

Deu 9:29 But these are your people, your heritage, whom you yourself have brought out by your great power 
and your outstretched arm’”. 

Deu 10:1 “Yahweh then said to me, ‘Cut two stone tablets like the first ones, and come up to me on the 
mountain. Make an ark of wood; 

Deu 1 0:2 on the tablets I shall inscribe the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke; put them in the 
ark’. 

Deu 10:3 So I made an ark of acacia wood, cut two stone tablets like the first and went up the mountain with the 
two tablets in my hand. 

Deu 10:4 And he inscribed the tablets, as he had inscribed them before, with the Ten Words which Yahweh had 
said to you on the mountain, from the heart of the fire, on the day of the Assembly. Yahweh then gave them to 
me. 

Deu 10:5 I turned and came down from the mountain and put the tablets in the ark I had made, and there they 
stayed, as Yahweh had commanded me. 

Deu 10:6 “The Israelites left the wells of the Bene-Jaakan for Moserah, where Aaron died; he was buried there, 
and his son Eleazar succeeded him in the priesthood. 

Deu 1 0:7 From there, they set out for Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah for Jotbathah, an area rich in streams. 

Deu 1 0:8 Yahweh then set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of Yahweh’s covenant, to stand in the 
presence of Yahweh, to serve him and to bless in his name, as they still do today. 

Deu 10:9 This is why Levi has no share or heritage with his brothers: Yahweh is his heritage, as Yahweh your 
God then told him. 

Deu 10:10 “And, as before, I stayed on the mountain for forty days and forty nights. And again Yahweh heard 
my prayer and agreed not to destroy you. 

Deu 10:1 1 And Yahweh said to me, ‘Be on your way at the head of this people, so that they can go and take 
possession of the country which I swore to their ancestors that I would give them’. 

Deu 10:12 “And now, Israel, what does Yahweh your God ask of you? Only this: to fear Yahweh your God, to 
follow all his ways, to love him, to serve Yahweh your God with all your heart and all your soul, 

Deu 10:13 to keep the commandments and laws of Yahweh, which I am laying down for you today for your own 
good. 

Deu 10:14 “Look, to Yahweh your God belong heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth and everything on 
it; 

Deu 10:15 yet it was on your ancestors, for love of them, that Yahweh set his heart to love them, and he chose 
their descendants after them, you yourselves, out of all nations, up to the present day. 

Deu 10:16 Circumcise your heart then and be obstinate no longer; 



Deu 10:17 for Yahweh your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, triumphant and terrible, free of 
favouritism, never to be bribed. 

Deu 10:18 He it is who sees justice done for the orphan and the widow, who loves the stranger and gives him 
food and clothing. 

Deu 10:19 (Love the stranger then, for you were once strangers in Egypt.) 

Deu 1 0:20 Yahweh your God is the one whom you must fear and serve; to him you must hold firm; in his name 
take your oaths. 

Deu 10:21 Him you must praise, he is your God: for you he has done these great and terrible things which you 
have seen for yourselves; 

Deu 10:22 and, although your ancestors numbered only seventy persons when they went down to Egypt, 
Yahweh your God has now made you as many as the stars of heaven”. 

Deu 1 1:1 “You must love Yahweh your God and always keep his observances, his laws, his customs, his 
commandments. 

Deu 1 1 :2 You are the ones who have had the experience, not your children. They have not had the experience, 
they have not witnessed the lessons of Yahweh your God, his greatness, his mighty hand and his outstretched 
arm, 

Deu 1 1 :3 the signs and the deeds which he performed in the heart of Egypt, against Pharaoh king of Egypt and 
his entire country, 

Deu 1 1 :4 what he did to the armies of Egypt, to their horses and their chariots, by overwhelming them with the 
waters of the Sea of Reeds when they were pursuing you, and leaving no trace of them to this day; 

Deu 1 1 :5 what he did for you in the desert, until you arrived here; 

Deu 1 1 :6 what he did to Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab the Reubenite, when, with all Israel standing 
round, the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, with their families, their tents and all their supporters. 
Deu 1 1 :7 All these great deeds of Yahweh you have seen with your own eyes. 

Deu 1 1 :8 “You must keep all the commandments which I enjoin on you today, so that you may have the strength 
to conquer the country into which you are about to cross, to take possession of it, 

Deu 1 1 :9 and so that you may live long in the country which Yahweh promised on oath to bestow on your 
ancestors and their descendants, a country flowing with milk and honey. 

Deu 11:10 “For the country which you are about to enter and make your own is not like the country of Egypt 
from which you have come, where, having done your sowing, you had to water the seed by foot, as though in a 
vegetable garden. 

Deu 11:11 No, the country which you are about to enter and make your own, is a country of hills and valleys 
watered by the rain of heaven. 

Deu 11:12 Yahweh your God looks after this country, the eyes of Yahweh your God are always on it, from the 
beginning of the year to the end. 

Deu 11:13 Depend on it: if you faithfully obey the commandments I enjoin on you today, loving Yahweh your 
God and serving him with all your heart and all your soul, 

Deu 11:14 I shall give your country rain at the right time, rain in autumn, rain in spring, so that you can harvest 
your wheat, your new wine and your oil. 

Deu 11:15 I shall provide grass in the fields for your cattle, and you will eat to your heart’s content. 

Deu 11:16 Beware of letting your heart be seduced: if you go astray, serve other gods and bow down to them, 
Deu 11:17 Yahweh’s anger will be kindled against you, he will shut the heavens, there will be no more rain, the 
soil will not yield its produce and, in the fine country given you by Yahweh, you will quickly perish. 

Deu 11:18 “Let these words of mine remain in your heart and in your soul; fasten them on your hand as a sign 
and on your forehead as a headband. 

Deu 11:19 Teach them to your children, and keep on telling them, when you are sitting at home, when you are 
out and about, when you are lying down and when you are standing up. 

Deu 1 1 :20 Write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates, 

Deu 1 1 :21 so that you and your children may live long in the country which Yahweh swore to your ancestors 
that he would give them for as long as there is a sky above the earth. 

Deu 1 1 :22 “For if you faithfully keep and observe all these commandments that I enjoin on you today, loving 
Yahweh your God, following all his ways and holding fast to him, 

Deu 1 1 :23 Yahweh will dispossess all these nations before you, and you will dispossess nations greater and 
more powerful than yourselves. 

Deu 1 1 :24 Wherever the sole of your foot treads will be yours; your territory will run from the desert all the way 
to the Lebanon; and from the River, from the River Euphrates, as far as the Western Sea, will be your territory. 
Deu 1 1 :25 No one will be able to resist you; Yahweh your God will make you feared and dreaded throughout the 
territory you tread, as he has promised you. 

Deu 1 1 :26 “Today, look, I am offering you a blessing and a curse: 



Deu 1 1 :27 a blessing, if you obey the commandments of Yahweh your God which I enjoin on you today; 

Deu 1 1 :28 a curse, if you disobey the commandments of Yahweh your God and leave the way which today I 
have marked out for you, by following other gods hitherto unknown to you. 

Deu 1 1 :29 And when Yahweh your God has brought you into the country which you are about to enter and 
make your own, you must set the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal. 

Deu 1 1 :30 (These mountains, as everyone knows, are on the other side of the Jordan on the westward road, in 
the territory of the Canaanites who live in the Arabah, opposite Gilgal, near the Oak of Moreh.) 

Deu 1 1 :31 For you are about to cross the Jordan, to enter and take possession of the country given you by 
Yahweh your God. You will possess it, you will live in it, 

Deu 1 1 :32 and you must keep and observe all the laws and customs promulgated by me to you today”. 

Deu 12:1 “Now, these are the laws and customs which you must keep in the country which Yahweh, God of your 
ancestors, is giving you as yours, and which you must observe every day that you live in that country. 

Deu 12:2 “You must completely destroy all the places where the nations you dispossess have served their gods, 
on high mountains, on hills, under any spreading tree; 

Deu 1 2:3 you must tear down their altars, smash their sacred stones, burn their sacred poles, hack to bits the 
statues of their gods and obliterate their name from that place. 

Deu 12:4 “Not so must you behave towards Yahweh your God. 

Deu 1 2:5 You must seek Yahweh your God in the place which he will choose from all your tribes, there to set 
his name and give it a home: that is where you must go. 

Deu 1 2:6 That is where you must bring your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes and offerings held 
high, your votive offerings and your voluntary offerings, and the first-born of your herd and flock; 

Deu 1 2:7 and that is where you must eat in the presence of Yahweh your God, rejoicing over your labours, you 
and your households, because Yahweh your God has blessed you. 

Deu 12:8 “You must not behave as we are behaving here today, each of you doing what he himself sees fit, 

Deu 12:9 since you have not yet come to the resting place and the heritage that Yahweh your God is going to 
give you. 

Deu 12:10 You are about to cross the Jordan and live in the country given you by Yahweh your God as your 
heritage; he will grant you peace from all the enemies surrounding you, and you will live in safety. 

Deu 12:1 1 To the place chosen by Yahweh your God as a home for his name, to that place you must bring all 
the things that I am laying down for you: your burnt offerings and your sacrifices, your tithes and offerings held 
high, and all the best of your possessions dedicated by you to Yahweh. 

Deu 12:12 That is where you will rejoice in the presence of Yahweh your God, you and your sons and 
daughters, your serving men and women, and the Levite living in your community since he has no share or 
heritage of his own among you. 

Deu 12:13 “Take care you do not offer your burnt offerings in all the sacred places you see; 

Deu 12:14 only in the place that Yahweh chooses in one of your tribes may you offer your burnt offerings and do 
all the things which I have commanded you. 

Deu 12:15 “This notwithstanding, and whenever you wish, you may slaughter and eat meat wherever you live — 
as much as the blessing of Yahweh affords you. Clean or unclean may eat it, as though it were gazelle or deer. 
Deu 12:16 You will not, however, eat the blood, but will pour that like water on the ground. 

Deu 12:17 “You must not eat the tithe of your wheat, of your new wine or of your oil, or the first-born of your herd 
or flock, or any of your votive offerings or voluntary offerings, or your offerings held high to Yahweh, at home. 

Deu 12:18 You must eat these in the presence of Yahweh your God in the place Yahweh your God chooses 
and there alone, you, your son and your daughter, your serving man and serving woman, and the Levite living in 
your community, expressing your joy in all your labours in the presence of Yahweh your God. 

Deu 12:19 As long as you live on your soil, be careful not to neglect the Levite. 

Deu 12:20 “When Yahweh your God enlarges your territory as he has promised you, and you say, ‘I should like 
to eat meat’, if you want to eat meat you may eat as much as you like. 

Deu 1 2:21 If the place in which Yahweh your God chooses to set his name is too far away, you may slaughter 
any of your herd or flock that Yahweh has given you, as I have prescribed for you; you may eat as much of it as 
you please at home. 

Deu 12:22 But you must eat it as you would gazelle or deer; clean and unclean may eat it together. 

Deu 12:23 Take care, however, not to eat the blood, since blood is life, and you must not eat the life with the 
meat. 

Deu 12:24 You must not eat it, but must pour it like water on the ground. 

Deu 12:25 You must not eat it — so that you, and your children after you, may prosper, doing what is right in 
Yahweh’s eyes. 

Deu 12:26 But the holy things of yours and the things which you have dedicated, you must go and take to the 
place chosen by Yahweh. 



Deu 12:27 The burnt offerings of meat and blood must be presented on the altar of Yahweh your God; whereäs, 
in your sacrifices, the blood must be poured on the altar of Yahweh your God; the meat you yourselves may eat. 
Deu 12:28 Faithfully keep and obey all these orders which I am giving you, so that you and your children after 
you may prosper for ever, doing what is good and right in the eyes of Yahweh your God. 

Deu 12:29 “When Yahweh your God has annihilated the nations confronting you, whom you are going to 
dispossess, and when you have dispossessed them and made your home in their country, 

Deu 12:30 beware of being entrapped into copying them, after they have been destroyed to make way for you, 
and do not enquire about their gods, saying, ‘How did these nations worship their gods? I am going to do the 
same too’. 

Deu 1 2:31 This is not the way to treat Yahweh your God. For in honour of their gods they have done everything 
detestable that Yahweh hates; yes, in honour of their gods, they even burn their own sons and daughters as 
sacrifices!”. 

Deu 13:1 “Whatever I am now commanding you, you must keep and observe, adding nothing to it, taking 
nothing away. 

Deu 1 3:2 “If a prophet or a dreamer of dreams arises among you, offering you some sign or wonder, 

Deu 1 3:3 and the sign or wonder comes about; and if he then says to you, ‘Let us follow other gods (hitherto 
unknown to you) and serve them’, 

Deu 13:4 you must not listen to that prophet’s words or to that dreamer’s dreams. Yahweh your God is testing 
you to know if you love Yahweh your God with all your heart and all your soul. 

Deu 13:5 Yahweh your God is the one whom you must follow, him you must fear, his commandments you must 
keep, his voice you must obey, him you must serve, to him you must hold fast. 

Deu 1 3:6 That prophet or that dreamer of dreams must be put to death, since he has preached apostasy from 
Yahweh your God who brought you out of Egypt and redeemed you from the place of slave-labour; and he would 
have diverted you from the way in which Yahweh your God has commanded you to walk. You must banish this 
evil from among you. 

Deu 1 3:7 “If your brother, the son of your father or of your mother, or your son or daughter, or the spouse whom 
you embrace, or your most intimate friend, tries secretly to seduce you, saying, ‘Let us go and serve other 
gods’, unknown to you or your ancestors before you, 

Deu 1 3:8 gods of the peoples surrounding you, whether near you or far away, anywhere throughout the world, 
Deu 13:9 you must not consent, you must not listen to him; you must show him no pity, you must not spare him 
or conceal his guilt. 

Deu 13:10 No, you must kill him, your hand must strike the first blow in putting him to death and the hands of 
the rest of the people following. 

Deu 13:1 1 You must stone him to death, since he has tried to divert you from Yahweh your God who brought 
you out of Egypt, from the place of slave-labour. 

Deu 13:12 All Israel, hearing of this, will be afraid, and none of you will do such a wicked thing again. 

Deu 13:13 “If you hear that in one of the towns which Yahweh your God has given you for a home, 

Deu 13:14 there are men, scoundrels from your own stock, who have led their fellow-citizens astray, saying, 

‘Let us go and serve other gods’, hitherto unknown to you, 

Deu 13:15 it is your duty to look into the matter, examine it, and enquire most carefully. If it is proved and 
confirmed that such a hateful thing has taken place among you, 

Deu 13:16 you must put the inhabitants of that town to the sword; you must lay it under the curse of destruction 
— the town and everything in it. 

Deu 13:17 You must pile up all its loot in the public square and burn the town and all its loot, offering it all to 
Yahweh your God. It is to be a ruin for all time, and never rebuilt. 

Deu 13:18 From what is thus put under the curse of destruction you must keep nothing back, so that Yahweh 
may turn from the ferocity of his anger and show you mercy, and have pity on you and increase your numbers, 
as he swore he would to your ancestors, 

Deu 13:19 on condition that you listen to the voice of Yahweh your God by keeping all his commandments 
which I am enjoining on you today, and by doing what is right in the eyes of Yahweh your God”. 

Deu 14:1 “You are children of Yahweh your God. You must not gash yourselves or shave your foreheads for the 
dead. 

Deu 14:2 For you are a people consecrated to Yahweh your God, and Yahweh has chosen you to be his own 
people from all the peoples on the earth. 

Deu 14:3 “You must not eat anything disgusting. 

Deu 14:4 These are the animals you may eat: ox, sheep, goat, 

Deu 14:5 deer, gazelle, roebuck, ibex, antelope, oryx, mountain sheep. 

Deu 14:6 You may eat any animal that has a divided and cloven hoof and that is a ruminant. 

Deu 14:7 Of those, however, that are ruminants and of those that have a divided and cloven hoof you may not 



eat the following: the camel, the hare and the coney, which are ruminants but have no cloven hoof; you must 
class them as unclean. 

Deu 14:8 So also the pig, which though it has a cloven hoof is not a ruminant; you must class it as unclean. You 
must neither eat the meat of such animals nor touch their dead bodies. 

Deu 14:9 “Of whatever lives in water you may eat the following: you may eat anything that has fins and scales. 
Deu 14:10 But you must not eat anything without fins and scales: you must class it as unclean. 

Deu 14:1 1 “You may eat all clean birds, 

Deu 14:12 but the following birds you must not eat: the tawny vulture, the griffon, the osprey, 

Deu 14:13 the kite and the several kinds of buzzard, 

Deu 14:14 all kinds of raven, 

Deu 14:15 the ostrich, the screech owl, the seagull, the several kinds of hawk, 

Deu 14:16 owl, barn owl, ibis, 

Deu 14:17 pelican, white vulture, cormorant, 

Deu 14:18 stork, the several kinds of heron, hoopoe and bat. 

Deu 14:19 You are to class all winged insects as unclean and must not eat them. 

Deu 14:20 You may eat any clean fowl. 

Deu 14:21 “You must not eat any animal that has died a natural death. You may give it to a resident foreigner to 
eat, or sell it to a foreigner. For you are a people consecrated to Yahweh your God. “You must not boil a kid in its 
mother’s milk. 

Deu 1 4:22 “Every year, you must take a tithe of what your fields produce from what you have sown 
Deu 14:23 and, in the presence of Yahweh your God, in the place where he chooses to give his name a home, 
you must eat the tithe of your wheat, of your new wine and of your oil, and the first-born of your herd and flock; 
and by so doing, you will learn always to fear Yahweh your God. 

Deu 14:24 “If the road is too long for you, if you cannot bring your tithe because the place in which Yahweh 
chooses to make a home for his name is too far away, when Yahweh your God has blessed you, 

Deu 14:25 you must convert it into money and, with the money clasped in your hand, you must go to the place 
chosen by Yahweh your God; 

Deu 14:26 there you may spend the money on whatever you like, oxen, sheep, wine, fermented liquor, anything 
you please. There you must eat in the presence of Yahweh your God and rejoice, you and your household. 

Deu 14:27 Do not neglect the Levite living in your community, since he has no share or heritage of his own 
among you. 

Deu 14:28 “At the end of every three years, you must take all the tithes of your harvests for that year and collect 
them in your community. 

Deu 14:29 Then the Levite — since he has no share or heritage of his own among you — the foreigner, the 
orphan and the widow living in your community, will come and eat all they want. And so Yahweh your God will 
bless you in all the labours that you undertake”. 

Deu 15:1 “At the end of every seven years, you must grant remission. 

Deu 15:2 The nature of the remission is as follows: any creditor holding a personal pledge obtained from his 
fellow must release him from it; he must not exploit his fellow or his brother once the latter has appealed to 
Yahweh for remission. 

Deu 1 5:3 A foreigner you may exploit, but you must remit whatever claim you have on your brother. 

Deu 1 5:4 There must, then, be no poor among you. For Yahweh will grant you his blessing in the country which 
Yahweh your God is giving you to possess as your heritage, 

Deu 15:5 only if you pay careful attention to the voice of Yahweh your God, by keeping and practising all these 
commandments which I am enjoining on you today. 

Deu 15:6 If Yahweh your God blesses you as he has promised, you will be creditors to many nations but 
debtors to none; you will rule over many nations, and be ruled by none. 

Deu 1 5:7 “Is there anyone poor among you, one of your brothers, in any town of yours in the country which 
Yahweh your God is giving you? Do not harden your heart or close your hand against that poor brother of yours, 
Deu 15:8 but be open handed with him and lend him enough for his needs. 

Deu 15:9 Do not allow this mean thought in your heart, ‘The seventh year, the year of remission, is near’, and 
scowl at your poor brother and give him nothing; he could appeal against you to Yahweh, and you would incur 
guilt! 

Deu 15:10 When you give to him, you must give with an open heart; for this, Yahweh your God will bless you in 
all your actions and in all your undertakings. 

Deu 15:1 1 Of course, there will never cease to be poor people in the country, and that is why I am giving you 
this command: Always be open handed with your brother, and with anyone in your country who is in need and 
poor. 

Deu 15:12 “If your fellow Flebrew, man or woman, sells himself to you, he can serve you for six years. In the 



seventh year you must set him free, 

Deu 15:13 and in setting him free you must not let him go empty handed. 

Deu 15:14 By way of present, you will load his shoulders with things from your flock, from your threshing-floor 
and from your winepress; as Yahweh your God has blessed you, so you must give to him. 

Deu 15:15 Remember that you were once a slave in Egypt and that Yahweh your God redeemed you; that is 
why I am giving you this order today. 

Deu 15:16 “But if he says to you, ‘I do not want to leave you’, because he loves you and your household and is 
happy with you, 

Deu 15:17 you must take an awl and drive it through his ear into the door and he will be your servant for ever. 
You must do the same to a female slave. 

Deu 15:18 “Do not think it hard on you to have to give him his freedom; he is worth twice what a paid servant 
would cost you, and has served you for six years. And Yahweh your God will bless you in everything you do. 

Deu 15:19 “You must consecrate every first-born male from your herd and flock to Yahweh your God. You must 
not put the first-born of your herd to work, or shear the first-born of your flock. 

Deu 1 5:20 You must eat it, you and your household, each year, in the presence of Yahweh your God, in the 
place which Yahweh chooses. 

Deu 15:21 If it has any defect, if it is lame or blind — any serious defect — you must not sacrifice it to Yahweh 
your God. 

Deu 15:22 You will eat it at home, unclean and clean together, as you would gazelle or deer; 

Deu 15:23 only, you will not eat its blood, but pour that like water on the ground”. 

Deu 16:1 “Observe the month of Abib and celebrate the Passover for Yahweh your God, because it was in the 
month of Abib that Yahweh your God brought you out of Egypt by night. 

Deu 1 6:2 You must sacrifice a Passover from your flock or herd for Yahweh your God in the place where 
Yahweh chooses to give his name a home. 

Deu 16:3 You must not eat leavened bread with this; for seven days you must eat it with unleavened bread — 
the bread of affliction — since you left Egypt in great haste; this is so that, as long as you live, you will remember 
the day you came out of Egypt. 

Deu 16:4 For seven days no leaven must be found in any house throughout your territory, nor must any of the 
meat that you sacrifice in the evening of the first day be kept overnight until the next day. 

Deu 16:5 You must sacrifice the Passover not in any of the towns given you by Yahweh your God, 

Deu 16:6 but in the place where Yahweh your God chooses to give his name a home; there you must sacrifice 
the Passover, in the evening at sunset, at the hour when you came out of Egypt. 

Deu 16:7 You will cook it and eat it in the place chosen by Yahweh your God, and in the morning you must 
return and go to your tents. 

Deu 1 6:8 For six days you will eat unleavened bread; on the seventh day there will be an assembly for Yahweh 
your God; and you must do no work. 

Deu 16:9 “You must count seven weeks, counting these seven weeks from the time you begin to put your sickle 
into the standing corn. 

Deu 16:10 You will then celebrate the feast of Weeks for Yahweh your God with the gift of a voluntary offering 
proportionate to the degree in which Yahweh your God has blessed you. 

Deu 16:1 1 You must rejoice in the presence of Yahweh your God, in the place where Yahweh your God 
chooses to give his name a home, you, your son and your daughter, your serving men and women, the Levite 
living in your community, the foreigner, the orphan and the widow living among you. 

Deu 16:12 Remember that you were once a slave in Egypt, and carefully observe these laws. 

Deu 16:13 “You must celebrate the feast of Shelters for seven days, at the time when you gather in the produce 
of your threshing-floor and winepress. 

Deu 16:14 You must rejoice at your feast, you, your son and your daughter, your serving men and women, the 
Levite, the foreigner, the orphan and the widow living in your community. 

Deu 16:15 For seven days, you must celebrate the feast for Yahweh your God in the place chosen by Yahweh; 
for Yahweh your God will bless you in all your produce and in all your undertakings, so that you will have good 
reason to rejoice. 

Deu 16:16 “Three times a year all your menfolk must appear before Yahweh your God in the place chosen by 
him: at the feast of Unleavened Bread, at the feast of Weeks, at the feast of Shelters. No one must appear 
empty-handed before Yahweh, 

Deu 16:17 but each must give what he can, in proportion to the blessing which Yahweh your God has bestowed 
on you. 

Deu 16:18 “You must appoint judges and scribes in each of the towns that Yahweh your God is giving you, for 
all your tribes; these are to mete out proper justice to the people. 

Deu 16:19 You must not pervert the law; you must be impartial; you will take no bribes, for a bribe blinds the 



eyes of the wise and ruins the cause of the upright. 

Deu 16:20 Strict justice must be your ideal, so that you may live long in possession of the country given you by 
Yahweh your God. 

Deu 1 6:21 “You must not plant a sacred pole of any wood whatsoever beside the altar which you erect for 
Yahweh your God; 

Deu 1 6:22 nor will you set up a standing-stone, a thing Yahweh your God would abhor”. 

Deu 17:1 “To Yahweh your God you must sacrifice nothing from herd or flock that has any blemish or defect 
whatsoever, for Yahweh your God holds this detestable. 

Deu 17:2 “If there is anyone, man or woman, among you in any of the towns given you by Yahweh your God, 
who does what is wrong in the eyes of Yahweh your God by violating his covenant, 

Deu 17:3 who goes and serves other gods and worships them, or the sun or the moon or any of heaven’s array 
— a thing I have forbidden- 

Deu 17:4 and this person is denounced to you: if after careful enquiry it is found true and confirmed that this 
hateful thing has been done in Israel, 

Deu 17:5 you must take the man or woman guilty of this evil deed outside your city gates, and there you must 
stone that man or woman to death. 

Deu 17:6 A death sentence may be passed only on the word of two witnesses or three; and no one must be put 
to death on the word of one witness alone. 

Deu 17:7 The witnesses’ hands must strike the first blow in putting the condemned to death, the rest of the 
people following. You must banish this evil from among you. 

Deu 17:8 “If a case comes before you which is too difficult for you, a case of murder, conflicting claims, damage 
to property — any kind of dispute — in your towns, you must make your way to the place chosen by Yahweh your 
God, 

Deu 17:9 and approach the levitical priests and the judge then in office. They will hold an enquiry and let you 
know their sentence. 

Deu 17:10 You must abide by the verdict which they give you in this place chosen by Yahweh, and you will take 
care to carry out all their instructions. 

Deu 17:1 1 You will abide by the decision which they give you and by the sentence which they pronounce, not 
deviating to right or to left from the verdict which they have given you. 

Deu 17:12 If anyone presumes to disobey either the priest who is there in the service of Yahweh your God, or 
the judge, that person must die. You must banish this evil from Israel. 

Deu 17:13 And when the people hear of this they will all be afraid and not act presumptuously any more. 

Deu 17:14 “If, having reached the country given by Yahweh your God and having taken possession of it and, 
while living there, you think, ‘I should like to appoint a king to rule me — like all the surrounding nations’, 

Deu 17:15 the king whom you appoint to rule you must be chosen by Yahweh your God; the appointment of a 
king must be made from your own brothers; on no account must you appoint as king some foreigner who is not a 
brother of yours. 

Deu 17:16 “He must not, however, acquire more and more horses, or send the people back to Egypt with a view 
to increasing his cavalry, since Yahweh has told you, ‘You must never go back that way again’. 

Deu 17:17 Nor must he keep on acquiring more and more wives, for that could lead his heart astray. Nor must 
he acquire vast quantities of silver and gold. 

Deu 17:18 Once seated on his royal throne, and for his own use, he must write a copy of this Law on a scroll, at 
the dictation of the levitical priests. 

Deu 17:19 It must never leave him, and he must read it every day of his life and learn to fear Yahweh his God 
by keeping all the words of this Law and observing these rules, 

Deu 17:20 so that he will not think himself superior to his brothers, and not deviate from these commandments 
either to right or to left. So doing, long will he occupy his throne, he and his sons, in Israel”. 

Deu 18:1 “The levitical priests, the whole tribe of Levi will be without share or heritage of their own in Israel; they 
will live on the foods offered to Yahweh and on his heritage. 

Deu 18:2 Levi will have no heritage of his own among his brothers; Yahweh will be his heritage, as he has 
promised him. 

Deu 18:3 “This is what is due to the priests from the people, from those who offer an ox or a sheep in sacrifice: 
the priest must be given the shoulder, the cheeks and the stomach. 

Deu 1 8:4 You must give him the first-fruits of your wheat, of your new wine and of your oil, as well as the first- 
fruits of your sheep-shearing. 

Deu 1 8:5 For Yahweh your God has chosen him from all your tribes to stand before Yahweh your God, to do the 
duties of the sacred ministry, and to bless in Yahweh’s name — him and his sons for all time. 

Deu 1 8:6 “If a Levite living in one of your towns anywhere in Israel decides to move to the place chosen by 
Yahweh, 



Deu 1 8:7 he shall minister there in the name of Yahweh his God like all his fellow Levites who stand ministering 
there in the presence of Yahweh, 

Deu 18:8 eating equal shares with them — what he has from the sale of his patrimony notwithstanding. 

Deu 18:9 “When you have entered the country given you by Yahweh your God, you must not learn to imitate the 
detestable practices of the nations there already. 

Deu 18:10 There must never be anyone among you who makes his son or daughter pass through the fire of 
sacrifice, who practises divination, who is soothsayer, augur or sorcerer, 

Deu 18:11 weaver of spells, consulter of ghosts or mediums, or necromancer. 

Deu 18:12 For anyone who does these things is detestable to Yahweh your God; it is because of these 
detestable practices that Yahweh your God is driving out these nations before you. 

Deu 18:13 “You must be faultless in your relationship with Yahweh your God. 

Deu 18:14 For these nations whom you are going to dispossess have listened to soothsayers and mediums, but 
Yahweh your God does not permit you to do this. From among yourselves, from among your own brothers, 

Deu 18:15 Yahweh your God will raise up a prophet like me; you will listen to him. 

Deu 18:16 This is exactly what you asked Yahweh your God to do — at Horeb, on the day of the Assembly, 
when you said, ‘Never let me hear the voice of Yahweh my God or see this great fire again, or I shall die’. 

Deu 18:17 Then Yahweh said to me, 

Deu 18:18 ‘What they have said is well said. From their own brothers I shall raise up a prophet like yourself; 

Deu 18:19 I shall put my words into his mouth and he will tell them everything I command him. Anyone who 
refuses to listen to my words, spoken by him in my name, will have to render an account to me. 

Deu 18:20 But the prophet who presumes to say something in my name which I have not commanded him to 
say, or who speaks in the name of other gods, that prophet must die’. 

Deu 18:21 “You may be privately wondering, ‘How are we to tell that a prophecy does not come from Yahweh?’. 
Deu 18:22 When a prophet speaks in the name of Yahweh and the thing does not happen and the word is not 
fulfilled, then it has not been said by Yahweh. The prophet has spoken presumptuously. You have nothing to 
fear from him”. 

Deu 19:1 “When Yahweh your God has annihilated the nations whose country Yahweh your God is going to give 
you, and you have dispossessed them and are living in their towns and in their houses, 

Deu 19:2 you must set aside three towns, centrally placed in the country which Yahweh your God is giving you 
for your own. 

Deu 19:3 You will keep the approaches to them in good order, dividing the area of the country which Yahweh 
your God is giving you as your heritage, into three parts, so that any killer can flee to these towns. 

Deu 1 9:4 Here is an example of how someöne may save his life by fleeing to them. “If anyone has struck his 
fellow accidentally, without any previous feud with him 

Deu 19:5 (for example, he goes with his fellow into the forest to cut wood; his arm swings the axe to fell a tree; 
the head slips off the handle and strikes his companion dead), that man may take refuge in one of these towns 
and save his life. 

Deu 1 9:6 It must not be allowed that the avenger of blood, in the heat of his anger, should pursue the killer and 
that the length of the road should help him to overtake and wound him fatally; for the man has not deserved to 
die, having had no previous feud with his victim. 

Deu 19:7 “Hence I am giving you this order: You must set aside three towns, 

Deu 19:8 and if Yahweh your God enlarges your territory, as he swore to your ancestors that he would, and 
gives you the whole country which he promised to give to your ancestors- 

Deu 19:9 provided that you keep and observe all the commandments which I am enjoining on you today, loving 
Yahweh your God and always following his ways-then, to those three towns you will add three more. 

Deu 19:10 In this way, innocent blood will not be shed in the country which Yahweh your God is going to give 
you as your heritage; otherwise you would incur blood-guilt. 

Deu 19:1 1 “But if it happens that a man has a feud with his fellow and lies in wait for him and attacks him and 
fatally wounds him and he dies, and the man takes refuge in one of these towns, 

Deu 19:12 the elders of his own town must send there and have him taken and handed over to the avenger of 
blood, to be put to death. 

Deu 19:13 You must show him no pity. You must banish the shedding of innocent blood from Israel, and then 
you will prosper. 

Deu 19:14 “You must not displace your neighbour’s boundary mark, positioned by men of old in the heritage 
soon to be yours, in the country which Yahweh your God is about to give you. 

Deu 19:15 “A single witness will not suffice to convict anyone of a crime or offence of any kind; whatever the 
misdemeanour, the evidence of two witnesses or three is required to sustain the charge. 

Deu 19:16 “If someöne gives false evidence against anyone, laying a charge of apostasy, 

Deu 19:17 both parties to this dispute before Yahweh must appear before the priests and judges then in office. 



Deu 19:18 The judges will make a careful enquiry, and if it turns out that the witness is a liar and has made a 
false accusation against his brother, 

Deu 19:19 you must treat the witness as he would have treated his brother. You must banish this evil from 
among you. 

Deu 19:20 The rest, hearing of this, will be afraid and never again do such an evil thing among you. 

Deu 19:21 You must show no pity. “Life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot”. 

Deu 20:1 “When you go to war against your enemies and see horses and chariots and an army greater than 
your own, you must not be afraid of them; Yahweh your God is with you, he who brought you out of Egypt. 

Deu 20:2 When you are about to join battle, the priest must come forward and address the people. 

Deu 20:3 He must say to them, ‘Listen, Israel: today you are about to join battle with your enemies. Do not be 
faint hearted. Let there be no fear or trembling or alarm as you face them. 

Deu 20:4 Yahweh your God is marching with you, to fight your enemies for you and make you victorious’. 

Deu 20:5 “The scribes will then address the people, as follows: ‘Has anyone built a new house and not yet 
dedicated it? Let him go home, in case he dies in battle and someöne else performs the dedication. 

Deu 20:6 ‘Has anyone planted a vineyard and not yet enjoyed its fruit? Let him go home, in case he dies in 
battle and someöne else enjoys its fruit. 

Deu 20:7 ‘Has anyone contracted to marry a girl and not yet married her? Let him go home, in case he dies in 
battle and someöne else marries her’. 

Deu 20:8 “Finally, the scribes will say to the people: ‘Is anyone frightened or faint hearted? Let him go home, in 
case he makes his brothers faint hearted too!’. 

Deu 20:9 “Then, when the scribes have finished speaking to the people, commanders will be appointed to lead 
them. 

Deu 20:10 “When you advance on a town to attack it, first offer it peace-terms. 

Deu 20:1 1 If it accepts these and opens its gates to you, all the people inside will owe you forced labour and 
work for you. 

Deu 20:12 But if it refuses peace and gives battle, you must besiege it. 

Deu 20:13 Yahweh your God having handed it over to you, you will put the whole male population to the sword. 
Deu 20:14 But the women, children, livestock and whatever the town contains by way of spoil, you may take for 
yourselves as booty. You will feed on the spoils of the enemies whom Yahweh your God has handed over to 
you. 

Deu 20:15 “That is how you will treat towns far away and not belonging to the nations near you. 

Deu 20:16 But as regards the towns of those peoples whom Yahweh your God is giving you as your heritage, 
you must not spare the life of any living thing. 

Deu 20:17 Instead, you must lay them under the curse of destruction: Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, 
Hivites and Jebusites, as Yahweh your God has commanded, 

Deu 20:18 so that they may not teach you to do all the detestable things which they do to honour their gods: in 
doing these, you would sin against Yahweh your God. 

Deu 20:19 “If, when attacking a town, you have to besiege it for a long time before you capture it, you must not 
destroy its trees by taking the axe to them: eat their fruit but do not cut them down. Is the tree in the fields 
human, that you should besiege it too? 

Deu 20:20 Any trees, however, which you know are not fruit trees, you may destroy and cut down and use to 
build siege-works against the hostile town until it falls”. 

Deu 21:1 “If, in the country which Yahweh your God gives you as your possession, a victim of murder is found 
lying in the open country and it is not known who has killed that person, 

Deu 21 :2 your elders and scribes must measure the distance between the victim and the surrounding towns, 

Deu 21 :3 and establish which town is the nearest to the victim. The elders of that town must then take a heifer 
that has not yet been put to work or used as a draught animal under the yoke. 

Deu 21 :4 The elders of that town must bring the heifer down to a permanently flowing river, to a spot that has 
been neither ploughed nor sown, and there by the river they must break the heifer’s neck. 

Deu 21 :5 The priests, the sons of Levi, will then step forward, these being the men whom Yahweh your God has 
chosen to serve him and to bless in Yahweh’s name, and it being their business to settle all cases of dispute or 
of violence. 

Deu 21 :6 All the elders of the town nearest to the victim of murder must then wash their hands in the stream, 
over the slaughtered heifer. 

Deu 21 :7 They must pronounce these words, ‘Our hands have not shed this blood and our eyes have seen 
nothing. 

Deu 21 :8 O Yahweh, forgive your people Israel whom you have redeemed, and let no innocent blood be shed 
among your people Israel. May this bloodshed be forgiven them!’. 

Deu 21 :9 You must banish all shedding of innocent blood from among you, if you mean to do what is right in the 



eyes of Yahweh. 

Deu 21:10 “When you go to war against your enemies and Yahweh your God delivers them into your power and 
you take prisoners, 

Deu 21:1 1 and among the prisoners you see a beautiful woman, and you fall in love with her, and you take her 
to be your wife 

Deu 21:12 and bring her home; she must shave her head and cut her nails, 

Deu 21:13 and take off her prisoner’s garb; she must stay inside your house and mourn her father and mother 
for a full month. You may then go to her and be a husband to her, and she will be your wife. 

Deu 21:14 Should she cease to please you, you will let her go where she wishes, not selling her for money: you 
must not make any profit out of her, since you have exploited her. 

Deu 21:15 “If a man has two wives, one loved and the other unloved, and the loved one and the unloved both 
bear him children, and if the first-born son is of the unloved wife, 

Deu 21:16 when the man comes to bequeath his goods to his sons, he may not treat the son of the wife whom 
he loves as the first-born, at the expense of the son of the wife whom he does not love, the true first-born. 

Deu 21:17 As his first-born he must acknowledge the son of the wife whom he does not love, giving him a 
double share of his estate; this son being the first-fruit of his vigour, the right of the first-born is his. 

Deu 21:18 “If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not listen to the voice either of his father or of his 
mother and, even when they punish him, still will not pay attention to them, 

Deu 21:19 his father and mother must take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his town at the gate of 
that place. 

Deu 21 :20 To the elders of his town, they will say, ‘This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious and will not listen 
to us; he is a wastrel and a drunkard’. 

Deu 21 :21 All his fellow-citizens must then stone him to death. You must banish this evil from among you. All 
Israel, hearing of this, will be afraid. 

Deu 21 :22 “If a man guilty of a capital offence is to be put to death, and you hang him from a tree, 

Deu 21 :23 his body must not remain on the tree overnight; you must bury him the same day, since anyone 
hanged is a curse of God, and you must not bring pollution on the soil which Yahweh your God is giving you as 
your heritage”. 

Deu 22:1 “If you see your brother’s ox or one of his sheep straying, you must not disregard it: you must take it 
back to your brother. 

Deu 22:2 And if he is not close at hand or you do not know who he is, you must take it home with you and keep 
it by you until your brother comes to look for it; you will then return it to him. 

Deu 22:3 “You must do the same with his donkey, the same with his cloak, the same with anything that your 
brother loses and that you find; you must not disregard it. 

Deu 22:4 “If you see your brother’s donkey or ox fall over on the road, you must not disregard it, but must help 
your brother get it on its feet again. 

Deu 22:5 “A woman must not dress like a man, nor a man like a woman; anyone who does this is detestable to 
Yahweh your God. 

Deu 22:6 “If, when out walking, you come across a bird’s nest, in a tree or on the ground, with chicks or eggs 
and the mother bird sitting on the chicks or the eggs, you must not take the mother as well as the chicks. 

Deu 22:7 Let the mother go; the young you may take for yourself. Thus will you have prosperity and long life. 
Deu 22:8 “When you build a new house, you must give your roof a parapet; then your house will not incur blood- 
vengeance, should anyone fall off the top. 

Deu 22:9 “You must not sow any other crop in your vineyard, or the whole yield may become forfeit, both the 
crop you have sown and the yield of your vines. 

Deu 22:10 “You must not plough with ox and donkey together. 

Deu 22:1 1 “You must not wear clothing woven part of wool, part of linen. 

Deu 22:12 “You must make tassels for the four corners of the cloak in which you wrap yourself. 

Deu 22:13 “If a man marries a woman, has sexual intercourse with her and then, turning against her, 

Deu 22:14 taxes her with misconduct and publicly defames her by saying, ‘I married this woman and when I 
had sexual intercourse with her I did not find evidence of her virginity’, 

Deu 22:15 the girl’s father and mother must take the evidence of her virginity and produce it before the elders of 
the town, at the gate. 

Deu 22:16 To the elders, the girl’s father will say, ‘I gave this man my daughter for a wife and he has turned 
against her, 

Deu 22:17 and now he taxes her with misconduct, saying, I have found no evidence of virginity in your daughter. 
Here is the evidence of my daughter’s virginity!’. 

Deu 22:18 They must then display the cloth to the elders of the town. 

Deu 22:19 The elders of the town in question will have the man arrested and flogged, and fine him a hundred 



silver shekels for publicly defaming a virgin of Israel, and give this money to the girl’s father. She will remain his 
wife; as long as he lives, he may not divorce her. 

Deu 22:20 “But if the accusation that the girl cannot show evidence of virginity is substantiated, 

Deu 22:21 she must be taken out, and at the door of her father’s house her fellow-citizens must stone her to 
death for having committed an infamy in Israel by bringing disgrace on her father’s family. You must banish this 
evil from among you. 

Deu 22:22 “If a man is caught having sexual intercourse with another man’s wife, both must be put to death: the 
man who has slept with her and the woman herself. You must banish this evil from Israel. 

Deu 22:23 “If a virgin is engaged to a man, and another man encounters her in the town and has sexual 
intercourse with her, 

Deu 22:24 you will take them both to the gate of the town in question and stone them to death: the girl, for not 
having called for help in the town; the man, for having exploited his fellow-citizen’s wife. You must banish this 
evil from among you. 

Deu 22:25 But if the man ran into the betrothed girl in the open country and slept with her, having taken her by 
force, her ravisher alone must die; 

Deu 22:26 you must do nothing to the girl, she has not committed a capital offence. The case is like that of a 
man who attacks and kills his fellow: 

Deu 22:27 since he came across her in the open country, the betrothed girl may have called out, without 
anyone’s coming to her rescue. 

Deu 22:28 “If a man meets a young virgin who is not betrothed and seizes her, sleeps with her and is caught in 
the act, 

Deu 22:29 her ravisher must give the girl’s father fifty silver shekels; since he has exploited her, she must be his 
wife and, as long as he lives, he may not divorce her”. 

Deu 23:1 “A man must not take his father’s wife; he must not withdraw the skirt of his father’s cloak from her. 

Deu 23:2 “A man whose testicles have been crushed or whose male member has been cut off must not be 
admitted to the assembly of Yahweh. 

Deu 23:3 No half-breed may be admitted to the assembly of Yahweh; not even his descendants to the tenth 
generation may be admitted to the assembly of Yahweh. 

Deu 23:4 No Ammonite or Moabite may be admitted to the assembly of Yahweh; not even his descendants to 
the tenth generation may be admitted to the assembly of Yahweh, and this is for all time; 

Deu 23:5 since they did not come to meet you with food and drink when you were on your way out of Egypt, and 
even hired Balaam son of Beor to oppose you by cursing you, from Pethor in Aram Naharaim. 

Deu 23:6 But Yahweh your God refused to listen to Balaam, and Yahweh your God turned the curse on you into 
a blessing, because Yahweh your God loved you. 

Deu 23:7 Never, as long as you live, must you seek their welfare or their prosperity. 

Deu 23:8 “You must not regard the Edomite as detestable, for he is your brother; you must not regard the 
Egyptian as detestable, since you were once a foreigner in his country. 

Deu 23:9 The third generation of children born to these may be admitted to the assembly of Yahweh. 

Deu 23:10 “When you are in camp, at war with your enemies, you must avoid anything bad. 

Deu 23:1 1 If any one of you is unclean by reason of a nocturnal emission, he must leave and not come back 
into camp, 

Deu 23:12 but towards evening wash himself, and return to camp at sunset. 

Deu 23:13 “You must have a latrine outside the camp, and go out to this; 

Deu 23:14 you must have a trowel in your equipment and, when you squat outside, you must scrape a hole with 
it, then turn round and cover up your excrement. 

Deu 23:15 For Yahweh your God goes about the inside of your camp to guard you and put your enemies at your 
mercy. Your camp must therefore be a holy place; Yahweh must not see anything indecent there or he will 
desert you. 

Deu 23:16 “You must not allow a master to imprison a slave who has escaped from him and come to you. 

Deu 23:17 Let him make his home with you and yours, wherever he pleases in whichever of your towns he 
prefers; you must not molest him. 

Deu 23:18 “There must be no sacred prostitute among the women of Israel, and no sacred prostitute among the 
men of Israel. 

Deu 23:19 You must not bring the wages of a prostitute or the earnings of a “dog” to the house of Yahweh your 
God, whatever vow you may have made: both are detestable to Yahweh your God. 

Deu 23:20 “You must not lend on interest to your brother, whether the loan be of money, of food, or of anything 
else that may earn interest. 

Deu 23:21 You may demand interest on a loan to a foreigner, but you must not demand interest from your 
brother; so that Yahweh your God may bless you in all your labours, in the country which you are about to enter 



and make your own. 

Deu 23:22 “If you make a vow to Yahweh your God, you must not be slack about fulfilling it: Yahweh your God 
will certainly hold you answerable for it and you will incur guilt. 

Deu 23:23 If, however, you make no vow, you do not incur guilt. 

Deu 23:24 Whatever passes your lips you must keep to, and the vow that you have made to Yahweh, your 
generous God, you must fulfil. 

Deu 23:25 “If you go into your neighbour’s vineyard, you may eat as many grapes as you please, but you must 
not put any in your basket. 

Deu 23:26 If you go into your neighbour’s standing corn, you may pick ears by hand, but you must not put a 
sickle into your neighbour’s corn”. 

Deu 24:1 “Suppose a man has taken a wife and consummated the marriage; but she has not pleased him and 
he has found some impropriety of which to accuse her; he has therefore made out a writ of divorce for her and 
handed it to her and then dismissed her from his house; 

Deu 24:2 she leaves his home and goes away to become the wife of another man. 

Deu 24:3 Then suppose this second man who has married her takes a dislike to her and makes out a writ of 
divorce for her and hands it to her and dismisses her from his house or if this other man who took her as his wife 
dies, 

Deu 24:4 her first husband, who has repudiated her, may not take her back as his wife now that she has been 
made unclean in this way. For that is detestable in Yahweh’s eyes and you must not bring guilt on the country 
which Yahweh your God is giving you as your heritage. 

Deu 24:5 “If a man is newly married, he must not join the army, nor must he be pestered at home; he must be 
left at home, free of all obligations for one year, to make his new wife happy. 

Deu 24:6 “No one may take a mill or a millstone in pledge; that would be to take life itself in pledge. 

Deu 24:7 “If anyone is caught, having kidnapped one of his brother-lsraelites, whether he makes him his slave 
or sells him, that thief must die. You must banish this evil from among you. 

Deu 24:8 “In a case of a virulent skin-disease, take care you faithfully observe and exactly carry out everything 
that the levitical priests direct you to do. You must keep and observe everything that I have commanded them. 
Deu 24:9 Remember what Yahweh your God did to Miriam when you were on your way out of Egypt. 

Deu 24:10 “If you are making your brother a loan on pledge, you must not go into his house and seize the 
pledge, whatever it may be. 

Deu 24:1 1 You must stay outside, and the man to whom you are making the loan must bring the pledge out to 
you. 

Deu 24:12 And if the man is poor, you must not go to bed with his pledge in your possession; 

Deu 24:13 you must return it to him at sunset so that he can sleep in his cloak and bless you; and it will be an 
upright action on your part in God’s view. 

Deu 24:14 “You must not exploit a poor and needy wage-earner, be he one of your brothers or a foreigner 
resident in your community. 

Deu 24:15 You must pay him his wages each day, not allowing the sun to set before you do, since he, being 
poor, needs them badly; otherwise he may appeal to Yahweh against you, and you would incur guilt. 

Deu 24:16 “Parents may not be put to death for their children, nor children for parents, but each must be put to 
death for his own crime. 

Deu 24:17 “You must not infringe the rights of the foreigner or the orphan; you must not take a widow’s clothes 
in pledge. 

Deu 24:18 Remember that you were once a slave in Egypt and that Yahweh your God redeemed you from that. 
That is why I am giving you this order. 

Deu 24:19 “If, when reaping the harvest in your field, you overlook a sheaf in that field, do not go back for it. The 
foreigner, the orphan and the widow shall have it, so that Yahweh your God may bless you in all your 
undertakings. 

Deu 24:20 “When you beat your olive tree, you must not go over the branches twice. The foreigner, the orphan 
and the widow shall have the rest. 

Deu 24:21 “When you harvest your vineyard, you must not pick it over a second time. The foreigner, the orphan 
and the widow shall have the rest. 

Deu 24:22 “Remember that you were once a slave in Egypt. That is why I am giving you this order”. 

Deu 25:1 “If people fall out, they must go to court for judgement; the judges must declare the one who is right to 
be in the right, the one who is wrong to be in the wrong. 

Deu 25:2 If the one who is in the wrong deserves a flogging, the judge must have him laid on the ground and 
flogged in his presence, the number of strokes proportionate to his offence. 

Deu 25:3 He may impose forty strokes but no more; otherwise, by the infliction of more, serious injury may be 
caused and your brother be humiliated before you. 



Deu 25:4 “You must not muzzle an ox when it is treading out the corn. 

Deu 25:5 “If brothers live together and one of them dies childless, the dead man’s wife may not marry a stranger 
outside the family. Her husband’s brother must come to her and, exercising his duty as brother, make her his 
wife, 

Deu 25:6 and the first son she bears must assume the dead brother’s name; by this means his name will not be 
obliterated from Israel. 

Deu 25:7 But if the man declines to take his brother’s wife, she must go to the elders at the gate and say, ‘I 
have no brother-in-law willing to perpetuate his brother’s name in Israel; he declines to exercise his duty as 
brother in my favour’. 

Deu 25:8 The elders of the town must summon the man and talk to him. If, on appearing before them, he says, 

‘I refuse to take her’, 

Deu 25:9 then the woman to whom he owes duty as brother must go up to him in the presence of the elders, 
take the sandal off his foot, spit in his face, and pronounce the following words, ‘This is what is done to the man 
who refuses to restore his brother’s house’, 

Deu 25:10 and his family must henceforth be known in Israel as House of the Unshod. 

Deu 25:1 1 “If, when two men are fighting, the wife of one intervenes to protect her husband from the other’s 
blows by reaching out and seizing the other by his private parts, 

Deu 25:12 you must cut off her hand and show no pity. 

Deu 25:13 “You must not keep two different weights in your bag, one heavy, one light. 

Deu 25:14 You must not keep two different measures in your house, one large, one small. 

Deu 25:15 You must keep one weight, full and accurate, so that you may have long life in the country given you 
by Yahweh your God. 

Deu 25:16 For anyone who does things of this kind and acts dishonestly is detestable to Yahweh your God. 

Deu 25:17 “Remember how Amalek treated you when you were on your way out of Egypt. 

Deu 25:18 He met you on your way and, after you had gone by, he fell on you from the rear and cut off the 
stragglers; when you were faint and weary, he had no fear of God. 

Deu 25:19 When Yahweh your God has granted you peace from all the enemies surrounding you, in the country 
given you by Yahweh your God to own as your heritage, you must blot out the memory of Amalek under heaven. 
Do not forget”. 

Deu 26:1 “When you have entered the country which Yahweh your God is giving you as heritage, when you 
have taken possession of it and are living in it, 

Deu 26:2 you must set aside the first-fruits of all the produce of the soil raised by you in your country, given you 
by Yahweh your God. You must put these in a basket and go to the place where Yahweh your God chooses to 
give his name a home. 

Deu 26:3 You will go to the priest then in office and say to him, ‘Today I declare to Yahweh my God that I have 
reached the country which Yahweh swore to our ancestors that he would give us’. 

Deu 26:4 “The priest will then take the basket from your hand and lay it before the altar of Yahweh your God. 

Deu 26:5 In the presence of Yahweh your God, you will then pronounce these words: ‘My father was a 
wandering Aramaean, who went down to Egypt with a small group of men, and stayed there, until he there 
became a great, powerful and numerous nation. 

Deu 26:6 The Egyptians ill-treated us, they oppressed us and inflicted harsh slavery on us. 

Deu 26:7 But we called on Yahweh, God of our ancestors. Yahweh heard our voice and saw our misery, our toil 
and our oppression; 

Deu 26:8 and Yahweh brought us out of Egypt with mighty hand and outstretched arm, with great terror, and 
with signs and wonders. 

Deu 26:9 He brought us here and has given us this country, a country flowing with milk and honey. 

Deu 26:10 Hence, I now bring the first-fruits of the soil that you, Yahweh, have given me’. “You will then lay 
them before Yahweh your God, and prostrate yourself in the presence of Yahweh your God. 

Deu 26:1 1 You must then rejoice in all the good things that Yahweh your God has bestowed on you and your 
family-you, the Levite and the foreigner living with you. 

Deu 26:12 “In the third year, the tithing year, when you have finished taking the tithe of your whole income and 
have given it to the Levite, the foreigner, the orphan and the widow so that, in your towns, they may eat to their 
heart’s content, 

Deu 26:13 in the presence of Yahweh your God, you must say: ‘I have cleared my house of what was 
consecrated. Yes, I have given it to the Levite, the foreigner, the orphan and the widow, in accordance with all 
the commandments you have imposed on me, neither going beyond your commandments nor neglecting them. 
Deu 26:14 When in mourning, I have not eaten any of it; when unclean, I have taken none of it away; I have 
given none of it for the dead. I have obeyed the voice of Yahweh my God and I have behaved in every way as 
you have commanded me. 



Deu 26:15 Look down from your holy dwelling, from heaven, and bless your people Israel and the country which 
you have given us, as you swore to our ancestors, a country flowing with milk and honey’”. 

Deu 26:16 “Yahweh your God commands you today to observe these laws and customs; you must keep and 
observe them with all your heart and with all your soul. 

Deu 26:17 “Today you have obtained this declaration from Yahweh: that he will be your God, but only if you 
follow his ways, keep his statutes, his commandments, his customs, and listen to his voice. 

Deu 26:18 And today Yahweh has obtained this declaration from you: that you will be his own people — as he 
has said — but only if you keep all his commandments; 

Deu 26:19 then for praise and renown and honour, he will raise you higher than every other nation he has 
made, and you will be a people consecrated to Yahweh, as he has promised”. 

Deu 27:1 Moses and the elders of Israel gave the people this command: “Keep all the commandments which I 
am laying down for you today. 

Deu 27:2 After you have crossed the Jordan into the country which Yahweh your God is giving you, you must 
set up tall stones, coat them with lime 

Deu 27:3 and on them write all the words of this Law, when you have crossed and entered the country which 
Yahweh your God is giving you, a country flowing with milk and honey, as Yahweh, God of your ancestors, has 
promised you. 

Deu 27:4 “When you have crossed the Jordan, you must erect these stones on Mount Ebal, as I command you 
today, and coat them with lime. 

Deu 27:5 There, for Yahweh your God, you must build an altar of stones, on which no iron has been used. 

Deu 27:6 You must build the altar of Yahweh your God of rough stones, and on this altar you will present burnt 
offerings to Yahweh your God, 

Deu 27:7 and immolate communion sacrifices and eat them there, rejoicing in the presence of Yahweh your 
God. 

Deu 27:8 On these stones you must write all the words of this Law; cut them carefully”. 

Deu 27:9 Moses and the levitical priests then said to all Israel: “Be silent, Israel, and listen. Today you have 
become a people for Yahweh your God. 

Deu 27:10 You must listen to the voice of Yahweh your God and observe the commandments and laws which I 
am laying down for you today”. 

Deu 27:1 1 That day Moses gave the people this order: 

Deu 27:12 “When you have crossed the Jordan, the following will stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people: 
Simeon and Levi, Judah and Issachar, Joseph and Benjamin. 

Deu 27:13 And the following will stand on Mount Ebal for the curse: Reuben, Gad and Asher, Zebulun, Dan and 
Naphtali. 

Deu 27:14 The Levites will then speak, proclaiming loudly to all the Israelites: 

Deu 27:15 ‘Accursed be anyone who makes a carved or cast idol, a thing detestable to Yahweh, a workman’s 
artefact, and sets it up in secret’. And the people are all to respond by saying, Amen. 

Deu 27:16 ‘Accursed be anyone who treats father or mother dishonourably’. And the people must all say, 

Amen. 

Deu 27:17 ‘Accursed be anyone who displaces a neighbour’s boundary mark’. And the people must all say, 
Amen. 

Deu 27:18 ‘Accursed be anyone who leads the blind astray on the road’. And the people must all say, Amen. 
Deu 27:19 ‘Accursed be anyone who violates the rights of the foreigner, the orphan and the widow’. And the 
people must all say, Amen. 

Deu 27:20 ‘Accursed be anyone who has sexual intercourse with his father’s wife and withdraws the skirt of his 
father’s cloak from her’. And the people must all say, Amen. 

Deu 27:21 ‘Accursed be anyone who has sexual intercourse with any kind of animal’. And the people must all 
say, Amen. 

Deu 27:22 ‘Accursed be anyone who has sexual intercourse with his sister, the daughter of his father or of his 
mother’. And the people must all say, Amen. 

Deu 27:23 ‘Accursed be anyone who has sexual intercourse with his mother-in-law’. And the people must all 
say, Amen. 

Deu 27:24 ‘Accursed be anyone who secretly strikes down his neighbour’. And the people must all say, Amen. 
Deu 27:25 ‘Accursed be anyone who accepts a bribe to take an innocent life’. And the people must all say, 
Amen. 

Deu 27:26 ‘Accursed be anyone who does not make the words of this Law effective by putting them into 
practice’. And the people must all say, Amen”. 

Deu 28:1 “But if you faithfully obey the voice of Yahweh your God, by keeping and observing all his 
commandments, which I am laying down for you today, Yahweh your God will raise you higher than every other 



nation in the world, 

Deu 28:2 and all these blessings will befall and overtake you, for having obeyed the voice of Yahweh your God. 
Deu 28:3 “You will be blessed in the town and blessed in the countryside; 

Deu 28:4 blessed, the offspring of your body, the yield of your soil, the yield of your livestock, the young of your 
cattle and the increase of your flocks; 

Deu 28:5 blessed, your basket and your kneading trough. 

Deu 28:6 You will be blessed in coming home, and blessed in going out. 

Deu 28:7 The enemies who attack you, Yahweh will defeat before your eyes; they will advance on you from one 
direction and flee from you in seven. 

Deu 28:8 Yahweh will command blessedness to be with you, on your barns and on all your undertakings, and 
he will bless you in the country given you by Yahweh your God. 

Deu 28:9 “From you Yahweh will make a people consecrated to himself, as he has sworn to you, if you keep the 
commandments of Yahweh your God and follow his ways. 

Deu 28:10 The peoples of the world, seeing that you bear Yahweh’s name, will all be afraid of you. 

Deu 28:1 1 Yahweh will make you abound in possessions: in the offspring of your body, in the yield of your cattle 
and in the yield of your soil, in the country which he swore to your ancestors that he would give you. 

Deu 28:12 For you Yahweh will open his treasury of rain, the heavens, to give your country its rain at the right 
time, and to bless all your labours. You will make many nations your subjects, yet you will be subject to none. 
Deu 28:13 Yahweh will put you at the head, not at the tail; you will always be on top and never underneath, if 
you listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God, which I am laying down for you today, and then keep 
them and put them into practice, 

Deu 28:14 not deviating to right or to left from any of the words which I am laying down for you today, by 
following other gods and serving them. 

Deu 28:15 “But if you do not obey the voice of Yahweh your God, and do not keep and observe all his 
commandments and laws which I am laying down for you today then all these curses will befall and overtake 
you. 

Deu 28:16 “You will be accursed in the town and accursed in the countryside; 

Deu 28:17 accursed, your basket and your kneading trough; 

Deu 28:18 accursed, the offspring of your body, the yield of your soil, the young of your cattle and the increase 
of your flock. 

Deu 28:19 You will be accursed in coming home, and accursed in going out. 

Deu 28:20 “Yahweh will send a curse on you, a spell, an imprecation on all your labours until you have been 
destroyed and quickly perish, because of your perverse behaviour, for having deserted me. 

Deu 28:21 Yahweh will fasten the plague on you, until it has exterminated you from the country which you are 
about to enter and make your own. 

Deu 28:22 Yahweh will strike you down with consumption, fever, inflammation, burning fever, drought, wind- 
blast, mildew, and these will pursue you to your ruin. 

Deu 28:23 The heavens above you will be brass, the earth beneath you iron. 

Deu 28:24 Your country’s rain Yahweh will turn into dust and sand; it will fall on you from the heavens until you 
perish. 

Deu 28:25 Yahweh will have you defeated by your enemies; you will advance on them from one direction and 
flee from them in seven; and you will be a terrifying object-lesson to all the kingdoms of the world. 

Deu 28:26 Your carcase will be carrion for all wild birds and all wild animals, with no one to scare them away. 
Deu 28:27 “Yahweh will strike you down with Egyptian ulcers, with swellings in the groin, with scurvy and the 
itch, for which you will find no cure. 

Deu 28:28 Yahweh will strike you down with madness, blindness, distraction of mind, 

Deu 28:29 until you grope your way at noon like a blind man groping in the dark, and your steps will lead you 
nowhere. “You will never be anything but exploited and plundered, with no one to save you. 

Deu 28:30 Get engaged to a woman, another man will have her; build a house, you will not live in it; plant a 
vineyard, you will not gather its first-fruits. 

Deu 28:31 Your ox will be slaughtered before your eyes and you will eat none of it; your donkey will be carried 
off in front of you and not be returned to you; your sheep will be given to your enemies, and no one will come to 
your help. 

Deu 28:32 Your sons and daughters will be handed over to another people, and every day you will wear your 
eyes out watching for them, while your hands are powerless. 

Deu 28:33 A nation hitherto unknown to you will eat the yield of your soil and of all your hard work. You will 
never be anything but exploited and crushed. 

Deu 28:34 You will be driven mad by the sights you will see. 

Deu 28:35 Yahweh will strike you down with foul ulcers on knee and leg, for which you will find no cure — from 



the sole of your foot to the top of your head. 

Deu 28:36 “Yahweh will send away both you and the king whom you have appointed to rule you to a nation 
unknown either to you or to your ancestors, and there you will serve other gods, made of wood and stone. 

Deu 28:37 And you will be the astonishment, the byword, the laughing-stock of all the peoples where Yahweh is 
taking you. 

Deu 28:38 “You will cast seed in plenty on the fields but harvest little, since the locust will devour it. 

Deu 28:39 You will plant and till your vineyards but not drink the wine or gather the grapes, since the grub will 
eat them up. 

Deu 28:40 You will grow olive trees throughout your territory but not anoint yourself with the oil, since your olive 
trees will be cut down. 

Deu 28:41 You will father sons and daughters but they will not belong to you, since they will go into captivity. 
Deu 28:42 All your trees and the whole yield of your soil will be the prey of insects. 

Deu 28:43 The foreigners living with you will rise higher and higher at your expense, while you yourself sink 
lower and lower. 

Deu 28:44 You will be subject to them, not they to you; they will be the ones at the head, and you the one at the 
tail. 

Deu 28:45 “All these curses will befall you, pursue you and overtake you until you have been destroyed, for not 
having obeyed the voice of Yahweh your God by keeping his commandments and laws which he has laid down 
for you. 

Deu 28:46 They will be a sign and a wonder over you and your descendants for ever. 

Deu 28:47 “For not having joyfully and with happy heart served Yahweh your God, despite the abundance of 
everything, 

Deu 28:48 you will have to serve the enemy whom Yahweh will send against you, in hunger, thirst, lack of 
clothing and total privation. He will put an iron yoke on your neck, until he has destroyed you. 

Deu 28:49 “Against you Yahweh will raise a distant nation from the ends of the earth like an eagle taking wing: a 
nation whose language you do not understand, 

Deu 28:50 a nation grim of face, with neither respect for the old, nor pity for the young. 

Deu 28:51 He will eat the yield of your cattle and the yield of your soil until you have been destroyed; he will 
leave you neither wheat, nor wine, nor oil, nor the young of your cattle, nor increase of your flock, until he has 
made an end of you. 

Deu 28:52 He will besiege you inside all your towns until your loftiest and most strongly fortified walls collapse, 
on which, throughout your country, you have relied. He will besiege you inside all the towns throughout your 
country, given you by Yahweh your God. 

Deu 28:53 During the siege and in the distress to which your enemy will reduce you, you will eat the offspring of 
your own body, the flesh of the sons and daughters given you by Yahweh your God. 

Deu 28:54 The gentlest and tenderest of your men will scowl at his brother, and at the wife whom he embraces, 
and at his remaining children, 

Deu 28:55 not willing to give any of them any of his own children’s flesh, which he is eating; because of the 
siege and the distress to which your enemy will reduce you in all your towns, he will have nothing left. 

Deu 28:56 The most refined and fastidious of your women, so refined, so fastidious that she has never ventured 
to set the sole of her foot to the ground, will scowl at the husband whom she embraces, and at her son and 
daughter, and at the after-birth when it leaves her womb, and at the child to which she has given birth- 
Deu 28:57 she will hide away and eat them, so complete will be the starvation resulting from the siege and the 
distress to which your enemy will reduce you in all your towns. 

Deu 28:58 “If you do not keep and observe all the words of this Law, which are written in this book, in the fear of 
this glorious and awe-inspiring name: Yahweh your God, 

Deu 28:59 Yahweh will strike you down with monstrous plagues, you and your descendants: with plagues 
grievous and lasting, diseases pernicious and enduring. 

Deu 28:60 He will afflict you with all the maladies of Egypt which you used to dread, and they will fasten on you. 
Deu 28:61 What is more, Yahweh will afflict you with all the plagues and all the diseases not mentioned in the 
book of this Law, until you have been destroyed. 

Deu 28:62 There will only be a small group of you left, you who were once as numerous as the stars of heaven. 
“For not having obeyed the voice of Yahweh your God, 

Deu 28:63 just as Yahweh used to delight in making you happy and in making your numbers grow, so will he 
take delight in ruining you and destroying you. You will be torn from the country which you are about to enter and 
make your own. 

Deu 28:64 Yahweh will scatter you throughout every people, from one end of the earth to the other; there you 
will serve other gods made of wood and stone, hitherto unknown either to you or to your ancestors. 

Deu 28:65 Among these nations there will be no repose for you, no rest for the sole of your foot; there Yahweh 



will give you a quaking heart, weary eyes, halting breath. 

Deu 28:66 Your life ahead of you will hang in doubt; you will be afraid day and night, uncertain of your life. 

Deu 28:67 In the morning you will say, ‘How I wish it were evening!’, and in the evening you will say, ‘How I 
wish it were morning!’, such terror will grip your heart and such sights you will see! 

Deu 28:68 Yahweh will send you back to Egypt, either by ship or by a road which I promised you would never 
see again. And there you will want to offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as serving men and women, but 
no one will buy you”. 

Deu 28:69 These are the words of the covenant which Yahweh ordered Moses to make with the Israelites in 
Moab, in addition to the covenant which he had made with them at Horeb. 

Deu 29:1 Moses called all Israel together and said to them: “You have seen everything that Yahweh did before 

your eyes in Egypt, to Pharaoh, to his servants and to his whole country- 

Deu 29:2 the great ordeals which you yourselves witnessed, those signs and the great wonders. 

Deu 29:3 But until today Yahweh has not given you a heart to understand, eyes to see, or ears to hear. 

Deu 29:4 “I have been leading you for forty years in the desert, yet the clothes which you have been wearing 
have not worn out, nor have the sandals on your feet. 

Deu 29:5 You have had no bread to eat, you have had no wine or fermented liquor to drink, so that you would 
learn that I, Yahweh, am your God. 

Deu 29:6 “When you reached this place, Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan came out to do battle 
against us; we defeated them. 

Deu 29:7 We conquered their country and gave it as heritage to Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh. 
Deu 29:8 “Keep the words of this covenant, put them into practice, and you will thrive in everything you do. 

Deu 29:9 “All of you are standing here today in the presence of Yahweh your God: your tribal leaders, your 
elders, your scribes, all the men of Israel, 

Deu 29:10 with your children and your wives (and the foreigner too who is in your camp, be he your wood-cutter 
or your water-carrier), 

Deu 29:1 1 and you are about to pass into the covenant of Yahweh your God, sworn with imprecation, which he 
has made with you today, 

Deu 29:12 and by which, today, he makes you a nation for himself and he himself becomes a God to you, as he 
has promised you, and as he swore to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. 

Deu 29:13 Not only on your behalf am I today making this covenant and pronouncing this solemn curse, 

Deu 29:14 not only on behalf of those standing here with us in the presence of Yahweh our God today, but also 
on behalf of those not here with us today. 

Deu 29:15 “Yes, you know the people with whom we used to live in Egypt, and those through whose countries 
we have travelled — the nations through whom we have passed. 

Deu 29:16 You have seen their abominations and their idols made of wood and stone, silver and gold, which 
were there. 

Deu 29:17 “Let there be no man or woman of you, no clan or tribe, whose heart turns away from Yahweh your 
God today, to go and serve the gods of these nations. Among you let there be no root which bears poison or 
wormwood. 

Deu 29:18 If, after hearing this imprecation, anyone, blessing himself, should say in his heart, ‘I shall do well 
enough if I follow the dictates of my heart; much water drives away thirst’, 

Deu 29:19 Yahweh will not pardon him. The wrath and jealousy of Yahweh will blaze against such a person; 
every curse written in this book will fall on him, and Yahweh will blot his name out under heaven. 

Deu 29:20 Yahweh will single him out of all the tribes of Israel for misfortune, in accordance with all the curses 
of the covenant written in the book of this Law. 

Deu 29:21 “The future generation, that of your children coming after you, and the foreigner arriving from some 
far-away land, on seeing the plagues and diseases inflicted on this country by Yahweh, will exclaim, 

Deu 29:22 ‘Sulphur! Salt!-The whole country is burning! No one will sow, nothing grow, no vegetation spring 
ever again! Devastation like that of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, devastated by Yahweh in his 
furious wrath!’. 

Deu 29:23 And all the nations will exclaim, ‘Why has Yahweh treated this country like this? Why this great blaze 
of anger?’. 

Deu 29:24 “And people will say, ‘Because they deserted the covenant of Yahweh, God of their ancestors, the 
covenant which he made with them when he brought them out of Egypt; 

Deu 29:25 because they went and served other gods and worshipped them, gods hitherto unknown to them, 
gods that were no part of their heritage from him: 

Deu 29:26 this is why Yahweh’s anger has blazed against this country, afflicting it with all the curses written in 
this book. 

Deu 29:27 In anger, in fury, in fierce wrath, Yahweh has torn them from their own country and flung them into 



another country, where they are today’. 

Deu 29:28 Things hidden belong to Yahweh our God, but things revealed are ours and our children’s for ever, 
so that we can put all the words of this Law into practice”. 

Deu 30:1 “And when all these words have come true for you — the blessing and the curse, which I have offered 
you — if you meditate on them in your heart wherever among the nations Yahweh your God has driven you, 

Deu 30:2 if you return to Yahweh your God, if with all your heart and with all your soul you obey his voice, you 
and your children, in everything that I am laying down for you today, 

Deu 30:3 then Yahweh your God will bring back your captives, he will have pity on you and gather you back 
from all the peoples among whom Yahweh your God has scattered you. 

Deu 30:4 Should you have been banished to the very sky’s end, Yahweh your God will gather you again even 
from there, will come there to reclaim you 

Deu 30:5 and bring you back to the country which belonged to your ancestors, so that you may possess it in 
your turn, and be made prosperous there and more numerous than your ancestors. 

Deu 30:6 “Yahweh your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your descendants, so that you will love 
Yahweh your God with all your heart and soul, and so will live. 

Deu 30:7 Yahweh your God will make all these curses recoil on your foes and on your enemies who have 
persecuted you. 

Deu 30:8 And once again you will obey the voice of Yahweh your God and you will put all his commandments 
into practice, which I am laying down for you today. 

Deu 30:9 Yahweh your God will make you prosper in all your labours, in the offspring of your body, in the yield 
of your cattle and in the yield of your soil. For once again Yahweh will delight in your prosperity as he used to 
take delight in the prosperity of your ancestors, 

Deu 30:10 if you obey the voice of Yahweh your God, by keeping his commandments and decrees written in the 
book of this Law, and if you return to Yahweh your God with all your heart and soul. 

Deu 30:1 1 “For this Law which I am laying down for you today is neither obscure for you nor beyond your reach. 
Deu 30:12 It is not in heaven, so that you need to wonder, ‘Who will go up to heaven for us and bring it down to 
us, so that we can hear and practise it?’. 

Deu 30:13 Nor is it beyond the seas, so that you need to wonder, ‘Who will cross the seas for us and bring it 
back to us, so that we can hear and practise it?’. 

Deu 30:14 No, the word is very near to you, it is in your mouth and in your heart for you to put into practice. 

Deu 30:15 “Look, today I am offering you life and prosperity, death and disaster. 

Deu 30:16 If you obey the commandments of Yahweh your God, which I am laying down for you today, if you 
love Yahweh your God and follow his ways, if you keep his commandments, his laws and his customs, you will 
live and grow numerous, and Yahweh your God will bless you in the country which you are about to enter and 
make your own. 

Deu 30:17 But if your heart turns away, if you refuse to listen, if you let yourself be drawn into worshipping other 
gods and serving them, 

Deu 30:18 I tell you today, you will most certainly perish; you will not live for long in the country which you are 
crossing the Jordan to enter and possess. 

Deu 30:19 Today, I call heaven and earth to witness against you: I am offering you life or death, blessing or 
curse. Choose life, then, so that you and your descendants may live, 

Deu 30:20 in the love of Yahweh your God, obeying his voice, holding fast to him; for in this your life consists, 
and on this depends the length of time that you stay in the country which Yahweh swore to your ancestors 
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob that he would give them”. 

Deu 31:1 Moses went and spoke to all Israel as follows, 

Deu 31 :2 “Today, I am one hundred and twenty years old, and can no longer act as leader. Yahweh has told 
me, ‘You shall not cross this Jordan’. 

Deu 31 :3 Yahweh your God himself will lead you across, he himself will destroy and dispossess these nations 
confronting you; Joshua too will lead you across, as Yahweh has said. 

Deu 31 :4 Yahweh will treat them as he has treated Sihon and Og the Amorite kings and their country — he 
destroyed them. 

Deu 31 :5 Yahweh will put them at your mercy, and you will deal with them exactly as prescribed by the 
commandments which I have laid down for you. 

Deu 31 :6 Be strong, stand firm, have no fear, do not be afraid of them, for Yahweh your God is going with you; 
he will not fail you or desert you”. 

Deu 31 :7 Moses then summoned Joshua and, in the presence of all Israel, said to him, “Be strong, stand firm; 
you will be the one to go with this people into the country which Yahweh has sworn to their ancestors that he 
would give them; you are to be the one who puts them into possession of it. 

Deu 31 :8 Yahweh himself will lead you; he will be with you; he will not fail you or desert you. Have no fear, do 



not be alarmed”. 

Deu 31 :9 Moses committed this Law to writing and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who carried the ark of 
Yahweh’s covenant, and to all the elders of Israel. 

Deu 31:10 And Moses gave them this command, “At the end of every seven years, at the time fixed for the year 
of remission, at the feast of Shelters, 

Deu 31:1 1 when all Israel assembles in the presence of Yahweh your God in the place chosen by him, you must 
proclaim this Law in the hearing of all Israel. 

Deu 31:12 Call the people together, men, women, children, and the foreigner residing with you, so that, hearing 
it, they may learn to fear Yahweh your God and keep and observe all the words of this Law. 

Deu 31:13 Their children, who as yet do not know it, will hear it and learn to fear Yahweh your God, all the time 
you live in the country which you are crossing the Jordan to possess”. 

Deu 31:14 Yahweh said to Moses, “And now the time is near when you must die. Summon Joshua and take 
your places at the Tent of Meeting, so that I can give him his orders”. Moses and Joshua went and took their 
places at the Tent of Meeting, 

Deu 31:15 and Yahweh showed himself at the Tent in a pillar of cloud; the pillar of cloud stood at the door of the 
Tent. 

Deu 31:16 Yahweh said to Moses, “You will soon be sleeping with your ancestors, and this people is about to 
play the harlot by following the gods of the foreigners of the country, among whom they are going to live. They 
will desert me and break my covenant, which I have made with them. 

Deu 31:17 That very day, my anger will blaze against them; I shall desert them and hide my face from them. A 
host of disasters and misfortunes will overtake them to devour them, and when that day comes they will say, ‘If 
such disasters overtake me, surely Yahweh my God cannot be with me?’. 

Deu 31:18 Yes indeed, I shall hide my face that day, on account of all the evil which they will have done by 
turning to other gods. 

Deu 31:19 “Now write down this song for you to use; teach it to the Israelites, put it into their mouths, for it to be 
a witness on my behalf against the Israelites: 

Deu 31 :20 against Israel, whom I am bringing into the country which I swore to his ancestors that I would give 
him, a country flowing with milk and honey: against Israel, who will eat to his heart’s content and grow fat, and 
will then turn to other gods and serve them, despising me and breaking my covenant. 

Deu 31 :21 When a host of disasters and misfortunes overtakes him, this song, like a witness, will give evidence 
against him, since his descendants will not have forgotten it. Yes, even today, before I have brought him to the 
country which I have promised him on oath, I know what plans he has in mind”. 

Deu 31 :22 So, that day, Moses wrote out this song and taught it to the Israelites. 

Deu 31 :23 To Joshua son of Nun, Yahweh gave this order, “Be strong and stand firm, for you are to be the one 
to bring the Israelites into the country which I have promised them on oath, and I myself shall be with you”. 

Deu 31 :24 When Moses had completely finished writing the words of this Law in a book, 

Deu 31 :25 he gave this command to the Levites who carried the ark of Yahweh’s covenant: 

Deu 31 :26 “Take the book of this Law and put it beside the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your God. Let it lie 
there as evidence against you. 

Deu 31 .21 For I know how rebellious and stiff-necked you are. If today, while I am still alive and with you, you 
rebel against Yahweh, how much more will you rebel against him after my death! 

Deu 31 :28 “Gather all your tribal elders and scribes round me, so that I may be sure that they hear these words, 
as I call heaven and earth to witness against them. 

Deu 31 :29 For I know that after my death you are certain to grow corrupt; you will leave the way which I have 
marked out for you; in the final days disaster will befall you for having done what is evil in Yahweh’s eyes, for 
having provoked his anger by your behaviour”. 

Deu 31 :30 In the hearing of the whole assembly of Israel, Moses then recited the words of this song to the end: 
Deu 32:1 Listen, heavens, while I speak; hear, earth, the words that I shall say! 

Deu 32:2 May my teaching fall like the rain, may my word drop down like the dew, like showers on the grass, 
like light rain on the turf! 

Deu 32:3 For I shall proclaim the name of Yahweh. Oh, tell the greatness of our God! 

Deu 32:4 He is the Rock, his work is perfect, for all his ways are equitable. A trustworthy God who does no 
wrong, he is the Honest, the Upright One! 

Deu 32:5 They have acted perversely, those he fathered without blemish, a deceitful and underhand brood. 

Deu 32:6 Is this the return you make to Yahweh? O people brainless and unwise! Is this not your father, who 
gave you being, who made you, by whom you subsist? 

Deu 32:7 Think back on the days of old, think over the years, down the ages. Question your father, let him 
explain to you, your elders, and let them tell you! 

Deu 32:8 When the Most High gave the nations each their heritage, when he partitioned out the human race, he 



assigned the boundaries of nations according to the number of the children of God, 

Deu 32:9 but Yahweh’s portion was his people, Jacob was to be the measure of his inheritance. 

Deu 32:10 In the desert he finds him, in the howling expanses of the wastelands. He protects him, rears him, 
guards him as the pupil of his eye. 

Deu 32:1 1 Like an eagle watching its nest, hovering over its young, he spreads out his wings to hold him, he 
supports him on his pinions. 

Deu 32:12 Yahweh alone is his guide; no alien god for him! 

Deu 32:13 He gives him the heights of the land to ride, he feeds him on the yield of the mountains, he gives him 
honey from the rock to taste, and oil from the flinty crag; 

Deu 32:14 curds from the cattle, milk from the flock, and the richness of the pasture, rams of Bashan’s breed, 
and goats, the richness of the wheat kernel; the fermented blood of the grape for drink. 

Deu 32:15 Jacob has eaten to his heart’s content, Jeshurun, grown fat, has now lashed out. (You have grown 
fat, gross, bloated.) He has disowned the God who made him, and dishonoured the Rock, his salvation, 

Deu 32:16 whose jealousy they aroused with foreigners — with things detestable they angered him. 

Deu 32:17 They sacrificed to demons who are not God, to gods hitherto unknown to them, to newcomers of 
yesterday whom their ancestors had never respected. 

Deu 32:18 (You forget the Rock who fathered you, the God who made you, you no longer remember.) 

Deu 32:19 Yahweh saw it and, in anger, he spurned his sons and daughters. 

Deu 32:20 “I shall hide my face from them”, he said, “and see what will become of them. For they are a deceitful 
brood, children with no loyalty in them. 

Deu 32:21 They have roused me to jealousy with a non-god, they have exasperated me with their idols. In my 
turn I shall rouse them to jealousy with a non-people, I shall exasperate them with a stupid nation. 

Deu 32:22 Yes, a fire has blazed from my anger, it will burn right down to the depths of Sheol; it will devour the 
earth and all its produce, it will set fire to the footings of the mountains. 

Deu 32:23 I shall hurl disasters on them, on them I shall use up all my arrows. 

Deu 32:24 They will be weakened by hunger, eaten away by plague and the bitter scourge. Against them I shall 
send the fang of wild animals and the poison of snakes that glide in the dust. 

Deu 32:25 Outside, the sword bereaves, while inside terror will reign. Young man and girl alike will perish, 
suckling and greybeard both together. 

Deu 32:26 I should crush them to dust, I said, I should wipe out all memory of them, 

Deu 32:27 did I not fear the boasting of the enemy”. But do not let their foes be mistaken! Do not let them say, 
“We have got the upper hand and Yahweh plays no part in this”. 

Deu 32:28 What a short-sighted nation this is, how thoroughly imperceptive! 

Deu 32:29 Were they wise, they would succeed, they would be able to read their destiny. 

Deu 32:30 How else could one man rout a thousand, how could two put ten thousand to flight, were it not that 
their Rock has sold them, that Yahweh has delivered them up? 

Deu 32:31 But their rock is not like our Rock; our enemies cannot pray for us! 

Deu 32:32 For their vine springs from the stock of Sodom and from the groves of Gomorrah: their grapes are 
poisonous grapes, their clusters are bitter; 

Deu 32:33 their wine is snakes’ poison, the vipers’ cruel venom. 

Deu 32:34 But he, is he not safe with me, sealed inside my treasury? 

Deu 32:35 Vengeance is mine, I will pay them back, for the time when they make a false step. For the day of 
their ruin is close, doom is rushing towards them, for he will see to it that their power fails, that neither serf nor 
free man remains. 

Deu 32:36 (For Yahweh will see his people righted, he will take pity on his servants.) 

Deu 32:37 “Where are their gods then?”. he will ask, “the rock where they sought refuge, 

Deu 32:38 who ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their libations?”. Let these arise and help you, 
let these be the shelter above you! 

Deu 32:39 See now that I, I am he, and beside me there is no other god. It is I who deal death and life; when I 
have struck, it is I who heal (no one can rescue anyone from me). 

Deu 32:40 Yes, I raise my hand to heaven, and I say, “As surely as I live for ever, 

Deu 32:41 When I have whetted my flashing sword, I shall enforce justice, I shall return vengeance to my foes, I 
shall take vengeance on my foes. 

Deu 32:42 I shall make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword will feed on flesh: the blood of the wounded 
and the prisoners, the dishevelled heads of the enemy!”. 

Deu 32:43 Heavens, rejoice with him, let all the children of God pay him homage! Nations, rejoice with his 
people, let God’s envoys tell of his power! For he will avenge the blood of his servants, he will return vengeance 
to my foes, he will repay those who hate him and purify his people’s country. 

Deu 32:44 Moses came with Joshua son of Nun and recited all the words of this song in the people’s hearing. 



Deu 32:45 When Moses had finished reciting these words to all Israel, 

Deu 32:46 he said to them, “Take all these words to heart; I intend them today to be evidence against you. You 
must order your children to keep and observe all the words of this Law. 

Deu 32:47 You must not think of this as empty words, for the Law is your life, and by its means you will live long 
in the country which you are crossing the Jordan to possess”. 

Deu 32:48 Yahweh spoke to Moses that same day and said to him, 

Deu 32:49 “Climb this mountain of the Abarim, Mount Nebo, in the country of Moab, opposite Jericho, and view 
the Canaan which I am giving to the Israelites as their domain. 

Deu 32:50 Die on the mountain you have climbed, and be gathered to your people, as your brother Aaron died 
on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people. 

Deu 32:51 Because, with the other Israelites, you broke faith with me at the Waters of Meribah-Kadesh in the 
desert of Zin, because you did not make my holiness clear to the Israelites; 

Deu 32:52 you may only see the country from outside; you cannot enter it — the country which I am giving to the 
Israelites”. 

Deu 33:1 This is the blessing that Moses, man of God, pronounced over the Israelites before he died. 

Deu 33:2 He said: Yahweh came from Sinai, from Seir he dawned on us, from Mount Paran blazed forth, For 
them he came, after the mustering at Kadesh, from his zenith as far as the foothills. 

Deu 33:3 You who love the ancestors! Your holy ones are all at your command. At your feet they fell, under your 
guidance went swiftly on. 

Deu 33:4 (Moses enjoined a law on us.) The assembly of Jacob comes into its inheritance; 

Deu 33:5 there was a king in Jeshurun when the heads of the people foregathered and the tribes of Israel were 
all assembled! 

Deu 33:6 May Reuben survive and not die out, survive though his men be few! 

Deu 33:7 Of Judah he said this: Listen, Yahweh, to the voice of Judah, and bring him back to his people. That 
his hands may defend his rights, come to his help against his foes! 

Deu 33:8 Of Levi he said: To Levi, give your urim, to your faithful one, your thummim, having tested him at 
Massah, having striven with him at the Waters of Meribah. 

Deu 33:9 Of his father and mother, he says, “I have not seen them”. He does not acknowledge his brothers, nor 
does he know his own children. Yes, they have kept your word, they hold firmly to your covenant. 

Deu 33:10 They will teach your customs to Jacob, and your Law to Israel. They will put incense before you and 
burnt offerings on your altar. 

Deu 33:1 1 Yahweh, bless his worthiness, and accept the actions he performs. Crush the loins of those who rise 
against him and of his foes, so that they rise no more! 

Deu 33:12 Of Benjamin he said: Beloved of Yahweh, he rests trustfully near him. The Most High protects him 
day after day and dwells between his hillsides. 

Deu 33:13 Of Joseph he said: His land is blessed by Yahweh. For him the best of heaven’s dew and of the deep 
that lies below, 

Deu 33:14 the best of what the sun makes grow, of what springs with every month, 

Deu 33:15 the first-fruits of the ancient mountains, the best from the hills of old 

Deu 33:16 the best of the land and all it holds, the favour of him who dwells in the Bush. May the hair grow thick 
on the head of Joseph, on the brow of the consecrated one among his brothers! 

Deu 33:17 First-born of the Bull, his the glory. His horns are the wild ox’s horns, with which he gores the 
peoples to the very ends of the earth. Such are the myriads of Ephraim, such are the thousands of Manasseh. 
Deu 33:18 Of Zebulun he said: Prosper, Zebulun, in your expeditions, and you, Issachar, in your tents! 

Deu 33:19 On the mountain where the people come to pray they offer upright sacrifices, for they taste the riches 
of the seas and the treasures hidden in the sands. 

Deu 33:20 Of Gad he said: Blessed be he who gives Gad space enough! He lies there like a lioness; he has 
savaged arm and face and head. 

Deu 33:21 Then he took the first portion for himself, saw that there was stored up for him a leader’s share. He 
has come at the head of the people, has carried out the saving justice of Yahweh and his judgements on Israel. 
Deu 33:22 Of Dan he said: Dan is a lion cub leaping from Bashan. 

Deu 33:23 Of Naphtali he said: Naphtali, sated with favours, filled with the blessings of Yahweh: the west and 
south are to be his domain. 

Deu 33:24 Of Asher he said: Most blessed of the sons let Asher be! Let him be the most privileged of his 
brothers and let him bathe his feet in oil! 

Deu 33:25 Be your bolts of iron and of bronze and your security as lasting as your days! 

Deu 33:26 No one is like the God of Jeshurun: he rides the heavens to your rescue, rides the clouds in his 
majesty! 

Deu 33:27 The God of old is your refuge, his the eternal arm which here below drives the enemy before you; he 



it is who says, “Destroy!”. 

Deu 33:28 Israel rests trustfully. The well-spring of Jacob is chosen out for a land of corn and wine; there 
heaven itself rains down dew. 

Deu 33:29 Blessed are you, O Israel! Who is like you, O victorious people? Yahweh is the shield that protects 
you and the sword that leads you to triumph. Your enemies will try to corrupt you, but you yourself will trample on 
their backs. 

Deu 34:1 Then, leaving the Plains of Moab, Moses went up Mount Nebo, the peak of Pisgah opposite Jericho, 
and Yahweh showed him the whole country: Gilead as far as Dan, 

Deu 34:2 the whole of Naphtali, the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, the whole country of Judah as far as the 
Western Sea, 

Deu 34:3 the Negeb, and the region of the Valley of Jericho, city of palm trees, as far as Zoar. 

Deu 34:4 Yahweh said to him, “This is the country which I promised on oath to give to Abraham, Isaac and 
Jacob, saying: I shall give it to your descendants. I have allowed you to see it for yourself, but you will not cross 
into it”. 

Deu 34:5 There in the country of Moab, Moses, servant of Yahweh, died as Yahweh decreed; 

Deu 34:6 he buried him in the valley, in the country of Moab, opposite Beth-Peor; but to this day no one has 
ever found his grave. 

Deu 34:7 Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died, his eye undimmed, his vigour unimpaired. 
Deu 34:8 The Israelites wept for Moses on the Plains of Moab for thirty days. The days of weeping for the 
mourning rites of Moses came to an end. 

Deu 34:9 Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands on him, and him 
the Israelites obeyed, carrying out the order which Yahweh had given to Moses. 

Deu 34:10 Since then, there has never been such a prophet in Israel as Moses, the man whom Yahweh knew 
face to face. 

Deu 34:1 1 What signs and wonders Yahweh caused him to perform in Egypt against Pharaoh, all his servants 
and his whole country! 

Deu 34:12 How mighty the hand and great the fear that Moses wielded in the eyes of all Israel!
