<h4>Prologue (1:1–4)</h4>

<p>Seeing that many others have undertaken to draw up accounts of the events that have reached their fulfilment among us, as these were handed down to us by those who from the outset were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word, I in my turn, after carefully going over the whole story from the beginning, have decided to write an ordered account for you, Theophilus, so that your Excellency may learn how well founded the teaching is that you have received.</p>

<h2 id="i">I: The Birth and Hidden Life of John the Baptist and of Jesus
(1:1–2:52)</h2>

<h4>The birth of John the Baptist foretold (1:5–25)</h4>

<p>In the days of King Herod of Judaea there lived a priest called Zechariah who belonged to the Abijah section of the priesthood, and he had a wife, Elizabeth by name, who was a descendant of Aaron. Both were upright in the sight of God and impeccably carried out all the commandments and observances of the Lord. But they were childless: Elizabeth was barren and they were both advanced in years.</p>

<p>Now it happened that it was the turn of his section to serve, and he was exercising his priestly office before God when it fell to him by lot, as the priestly custom was, to enter the Lord’s sanctuary and burn incense there. And at the hour of incense all the people were outside, praying.</p>

<p>Then there appeared to him the angel of the Lord, standing on the right of the altar of incense. The sight disturbed Zechariah and he was overcome with fear. But the angel said to him, “Zechariah, do not be afraid, for your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth is to bear you a son and you shall name him John. He will be your joy and delight and many will rejoice at his birth, for he will be great in the sight of the Lord; he must drink no wine, no strong drink; even from his mother’s womb he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, and he will bring back many of the Israelites to the Lord their God. With the spirit and power of Elijah, he will go before him <i>to reconcile fathers to their children</i> and the disobedient to the good sense of the upright, preparing for the Lord a people fit for him”.</p>

<p>Zechariah said to the angel, “How can I know this? I am an old man and my wife is getting on in years”.</p>

<p>The angel replied, “I am Gabriel, who stand in God’s presence, and I have been sent to speak to you and bring you this good news. Look! Since you did not believe my words, which will come true at their appointed time, you will be silenced and have no power of speech until this has happened”. Meanwhile the people were waiting for Zechariah and were surprised that he stayed in the sanctuary so long. When he came out he could not speak to them, and they realised that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary. But he could only make signs to them and remained dumb.</p>

<p>When his time of service came to an end he returned home. Some time later his wife Elizabeth conceived and for five months she kept to herself, saying, “The Lord has done this for me, now that it has pleased him to take away the humiliation I suffered in public”.</p>

<h4>The annunciation (1:26–38)</h4>

<p>In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph, of the House of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary. He went in and said to her, “Rejoice, you who enjoy God’s favour! The Lord is with you”. She was deeply disturbed by these words and asked herself what this greeting could mean, but the angel said to her, “Mary, do not be afraid; you have won God’s favour. Look! You are to conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you must name him Jesus. He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David; he will rule over the House of Jacob for ever and his reign will have no end”.</p>

<p>Mary said to the angel, “But how can this come about, since I have no knowledge of man?”.</p>

<p>The angel answered, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will cover you with its shadow. And so the child will be holy and will be called Son of God. And I tell you this too: your cousin Elizabeth also, in her old age, has conceived a son, and she whom people called barren is now in her sixth month, <i>for nothing is impossible to God</i>”.</p>

<p>Mary said, “You see before you the Lord’s servant, let it happen to me as you have said”. And the angel left her.</p>

<h4>The visitation (1:39–45)</h4>

<p>Mary set out at that time and went as quickly as she could into the hill country to a town in Judah. She went into Zechariah’s house and greeted Elizabeth. Now it happened that as soon as Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the child leapt in her womb and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. She gave a loud cry and said, “Of all women you are the most blessed, and blessed is the fruit of your womb. Why should I be honoured with a visit from the mother of my Lord? Look, the moment your greeting reached my ears, the child in my womb leapt for joy. Yes, blessed is she who believed that the promise made her by the Lord would be fulfilled”.</p>

<h4>The Magnificat (1:46–56)</h4>

<p>And Mary said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>
My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord</span><br />
<span>and my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour;</span><br />
<span>because he has looked upon the humiliation of his servant.</span><br />
<span>Yes, from now onwards all generations will call me blessed,</span><br />
<span>for the Almighty has done great things for me.</span><br />
<span>Holy is his name,</span><br />
<span>and his faithful love extends age after age to those who fear him.</span><br />
<span>He has used the power of his arm,</span><br />
<span>he has routed the arrogant of heart.</span><br />
<span>He has pulled down princes from their thrones and raised high the lowly.</span><br />
<span>He has filled the starving with good things, sent the rich away empty.</span><br />
<span>He has come to the help of Israel his servant, mindful of his faithful love</span><br />
<span>— according to the promise he made to our ancestors —</span><br />
<span>of his mercy to Abraham and to his descendants for ever.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p> Mary stayed with her some three months and then went home.</p>

<h4>The birth of John the Baptist and visit of the neighbours (1:57–58)</h4>

<p>The time came for Elizabeth to have her child, and she gave birth to a son; and when her neighbours and relations heard that the Lord had lavished on her his faithful love, they shared her joy.</p>

<h4>The circumcision of John the Baptist (1:59–66)</h4>

<p> Now it happened that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; they were going to call him Zechariah after his father, but his mother spoke up. “No”, she said, “he is to be called John”.</p>

<p>They said to her, “But no one in your family has that name”, and made signs to his father to find out what he wanted him called.</p>

<p>The father asked for a writing-tablet and wrote, “His name is John”. And they were all astonished. At that instant his power of speech returned and he spoke and praised God. All their neighbours were filled with awe and the whole affair was talked about throughout the hill country of Judaea. All those who heard of it treasured it in their hearts.</p>

<p>“What will this child turn out to be?”, they wondered. And indeed the hand of the Lord was with him.</p>

<h4>The Benedictus (1:67–79)</h4>

<p>His father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke this prophecy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,</span><br />
<span>for he has visited his people, he has set them free,</span><br />
<span>and he has established for us a saving power</span><br />
<span>in the House of his servant David,</span><br />
<span>just as he proclaimed,</span><br />
<span>by the mouth of his holy prophets from ancient times,</span><br />
<span>that he would save us from our enemies</span><br />
<span>and from the hands of all those who hate us,</span><br />
<span>and show faithful love to our ancestors,</span><br />
<span>and so keep in mind his holy covenant.</span><br />
<span>This was the oath he swore</span><br />
<span>to our father Abraham,</span><br />
<span>that he would grant us, free from fear,</span><br />
<span>to be delivered from the hands of our enemies,</span><br />
<span>to serve him in holiness and uprightness</span><br />
<span>in his presence, all our days.</span><br />
<span>And you, little child,</span><br />
<span>you shall be called Prophet of the Most High,</span><br />
<span>for you will go before the Lord</span><br />
<span>to prepare a way for him,</span><br />
<span>to give his people knowledge of salvation</span><br />
<span>through the forgiveness of their sins,</span><br />
<span>because of the faithful love of our God</span><br />
<span>in which the rising Sun has come from on high to visit us,</span><br />
<span>to give light to those who live</span><br />
<span>in darkness and the shadow dark as death,</span><br />
<span>and to guide our feet</span><br />
<span>into the way of peace.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>The hidden life of John the Baptist (1:80)</h4>

<p>Meanwhile the child grew up and his spirit grew strong. And he lived in the desert until the day he appeared openly to Israel.</p>

<h4>The birth of Jesus and visit of the shepherds (2:1–20)</h4>

<p>Now it happened that at this time Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be made of the whole inhabited world. This census — the first — took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria, and everyone went to be registered, each to his own town. So Joseph set out from the town of Nazareth in Galilee for Judaea, to David’s town called Bethlehem, since he was of David’s House and line, in order to be registered together with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child. Now it happened that, while they were there, the time came for her to have her child, and she gave birth to a son, her first-born. She wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the living-space. In the countryside close by there were shepherds out in the fields keeping guard over their sheep during the watches of the night. An angel of the Lord stood over them and the glory of the Lord shone around them. They were terrified, but the angel said, “Do not be afraid. Look, I bring you news of great joy, a joy to be shared by the whole people. Today in the town of David a Saviour has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord. And here is a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger”. </p>

<p>And all at once with the angel there was a great throng of the hosts of heaven, praising God with the words:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>Glory to God in the highest heaven,</span><br />
<span>and on earth peace for those he favours.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now it happened that when the angels had gone from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go to Bethlehem and see this event which the Lord has made known to us”. So they hurried away and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in the manger. When they saw the child they repeated what they had been told about him, and everyone who heard it was astonished at what the shepherds said to them. As for Mary, she treasured all these things and pondered them in her heart. And the shepherds went back glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, just as they had been told.</p>

<h4>The circumcision of Jesus (2:21)</h4>

<p>When the eighth day came and the child was to be circumcised, they gave him the name Jesus, the name the angel had given him before his conception.</p>

<h4>Jesus is presented in the Temple (2:22–28)</h4>

<p>And when the day came for them to be purified in keeping with the Law of Moses, they took him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord — observing what is written in the Law of the Lord: <i>Every first-born male must be consecrated to the Lord</i> — and also to offer in sacrifice, in accordance with what is prescribed in the Law of the Lord, a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons. Now in Jerusalem there was a man named Simeon. He was an upright and devout man; he looked forward to the restoration of Israel and the Holy Spirit rested on him. It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death until he had set eyes on the Christ of the Lord. Prompted by the Spirit he came to the Temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what the Law required, he took him into his arms and blessed God; and he said:</p>

<h4>The Nunc Dimittis (2:29–32)</h4>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>Now, Master, you are letting your servant go in peace</span><br />
<span>as you promised;</span><br />
<span>for my eyes have seen the salvation</span><br />
<span>which you have made ready in the sight of the nations;</span><br />
<span>a light of revelation for the gentiles</span><br />
<span>and glory for your people Israel.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>The prophecy of Simeon (2:33–35)</h4>

<p>As the child’s father and mother were wondering at the things that were being said about him, Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, “Look, he is destined for the fall and for the rise of many in Israel, destined to be a sign that is opposed — and a sword will pierce your soul too — so that the secret thoughts of many may be laid bare”.</p>

<h4>The prophecy of Anna (2:36–38)</h4>

<p>There was a prophetess, too, Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was well on in years. Her days of girlhood over, she had been married for seven years before becoming a widow. She was now eighty-four years old and never left the Temple, serving God night and day with fasting and prayer. She came up just at that moment and began to praise God; and she spoke of the child to all who looked forward to the deliverance of Jerusalem.</p>

<h4>The hidden life of Jesus at Nazareth (2:39–40)</h4>

<p>When they had done everything the Law of the Lord required, they went back to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth. And as the child grew to maturity, he was filled with wisdom; and God’s favour was with him.</p>

<h4>Jesus among the doctors of the law (2:41–50)</h4>

<p>Every year his parents used to go to Jerusalem for the feast of the Passover. When he was twelve years old, they went up for the feast as usual. When the days of the feast were over and they set off home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem without his parents knowing it. They assumed he was somewhere in the party, and it was only after a day’s journey that they went to look for him among their relations and acquaintances. When they failed to find him they went back to Jerusalem looking for him everywhere.</p>

<p>It happened that, three days later, they found him in the Temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them, and asking them questions; and all those who heard him were astounded at his intelligence and his replies. They were overcome when they saw him, and his mother said to him, “My child, why have you done this to us? See how worried your father and I have been, looking for you”.</p>

<p>He replied, “Why were you looking for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s house?”. But they did not understand what he meant.</p>

<h4>The hidden life at Nazareth resumed (2:51–52)</h4>

<p>He went down with them then and came to Nazareth and lived under their authority. His mother stored up all these things in her heart. And Jesus increased in wisdom, in stature, and in favour with God and with people.</p>

<h2 id="ii">II: Prelude to the Public Ministry of Jesus (3:1–4:13)</h2>

<h4>The proclamation of John the Baptist (3:1–18)</h4>

<p>In the fifteenth year of Tiberius Caesar’s reign, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judaea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of the territories of Ituraea and Trachonitis, Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, and while the high-priesthood was held by Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zechariah, in the desert. He went through the whole Jordan area proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins, as it is written in the book of the sayings of Isaiah the prophet: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>A voice of one that cries in the desert:</span><br />
<span>Prepare a way for the Lord,</span><br />
<span>make his paths straight!</span><br />
<span>Let every valley be filled in,</span><br />
<span>every mountain and hill be levelled,</span><br />
<span>winding ways be straightened</span><br />
<span>and rough roads made smooth,</span><br />
<span>and all humanity will see the salvation of God.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He said, therefore, to the crowds who came to be baptised by him, “Brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming retribution? Produce fruit in keeping with repentance, and do not start telling yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father’, because, I tell you, God can raise children for Abraham from these stones. Yes, even now the axe is being laid to the root of the trees, so that any tree failing to produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown on the fire”.</p>

<p>When all the people asked him, “What must we do, then?”, he answered, “Anyone who has two tunics must share with the one who has none, and anyone with something to eat must do the same”. </p>

<p>There were tax collectors, too, who came for baptism, and these said to him, “Master, what must we do?”.</p>

<p>He said to them, “Exact no more than the appointed rate”.</p>

<p>Some soldiers asked him in their turn, “What about us? What must we do?”.</p>

<p>He said to them, “No intimidation! No extortion! Be content with your pay!”.</p>

<p>A feeling of expectancy had grown among the people, who were beginning to wonder whether John might be the Christ, so John declared before them all, “I baptise you with water, but someone is coming, who is more powerful than me, and I am not fit to undo the strap of his sandals; he will baptise you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing-fan is in his hand, to clear his threshing-floor and to gather the wheat into his barn; but the chaff he will burn in a fire that will never go out”. And he proclaimed the good news to the people with many other exhortations too.</p>

<h4>John the Baptist imprisoned (3:19–20)</h4>

<p>But Herod the tetrarch, censured by John for his relations with his brother’s wife Herodias and for all the other crimes he had committed, added a further crime to all the rest by shutting John up in prison.</p>

<h4>Jesus is baptised (3:21–22)</h4>

<p>Now it happened that when all the people had been baptised and while Jesus after his own baptism was at prayer, heaven opened and the Holy Spirit descended on him in a physical form, like a dove. And a voice came from heaven, “<i>You are my Son; today have I fathered you</i>”.</p>

<h4>The ancestry of Jesus (3:23–38)</h4>

<p>When he began, Jesus was about thirty years old, being the son, as it was thought, of Joseph son of Heli, son of Matthat, son of Levi, son of Melchi, son of Jannai, son of Joseph, son of Mattathias, son of Amos, son of Nahum, son of Esli, son of Naggai, son of Maath, son of Mattathias, son of Semein, son of Josech, son of Joda, son of Joanan, son of Rhesa, son of Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, son of Neri, son of Melchi, son of Addi, son of Cosam, son of Elmadam, son of Er, son of Jesus, son of Eliezer, son of Jorim, son of Matthat, son of Levi, son of Symeon, son of Judah, son of Joseph, son of Jonam, son of Eliakim, son of Melea, son of Menna, son of Mattatha, son of Nathan, son of David, son of Jesse, son of Obed, son of Boaz, son of Sala, son of Nahshon, son of Amminadab, son of Admin, son of Arni, son of Hezron, son of Perez, son of Judah, son of Jacob, son of Isaac, son of Abraham, son of Terah, son of Nahor, son of Serug, son of Reu, son of Peleg, son of Eber, son of Shelah, son of Cainan, son of Arphaxad, son of Shem, son of Noah, son of Lamech, son of Methuselah, son of Enoch, son of Jared, son of Mahalaleel, son of Cainan, son of Enos, son of Seth, son of Adam, son of God.</p>

<h4>Testing in the desert (4:1–13)</h4>

<p>Filled with the Holy Spirit, Jesus left the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the desert, for forty days being put to the test by the devil. During that time he ate nothing and at the end he was hungry. Then the devil said to him, “If you are Son of God, tell this stone to turn into a loaf”.</p>

<p>But Jesus replied, “Scripture says: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>Human beings live not on bread alone”.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then leading him to a height, the devil showed him in a moment of time all the kingdoms of the world and said to him, “I will give you all this power and their splendour, for it has been handed over to me, for me to give it to anyone I choose. Do homage, then, to me, and it shall all be yours”.</p>

<p>But Jesus answered him, “Scripture says: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>You must do homage to the Lord your God, him alone you must serve”.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then he led him to Jerusalem and set him on the parapet of the Temple. “If you are Son of God”, he said to him, “throw yourself down from here, for scripture says: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>He has given his angels orders about you, to guard you,</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p> and again:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>They will carry you in their arms in case you trip over a stone”.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But Jesus answered him, “Scripture says: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>Do not put the Lord your God to the test”.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Having exhausted every way of putting him to the test, the devil left him, until the opportune moment.</p>

<h2 id="iii">III: The Galilean Ministry (4:14–9:50)</h2>

<h4>Jesus begins to preach (4:14–15)</h4>

<p>Jesus, with the power of the Spirit in him, returned to Galilee; and his reputation spread throughout the countryside. He taught in their synagogues and everyone glorified him.</p>

<h4>Jesus at Nazareth (4:16–30)</h4>

<p>He came to Nazara, where he had been brought up, and went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day as he usually did. He stood up to read, and they handed him the scroll of the prophet Isaiah. Unrolling the scroll he found the place where it is written:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>The spirit of the Lord is on me,</span><br />
<span>for he has anointed me</span><br />
<span>to bring the good news to the afflicted.</span><br />
<span>He has sent me to proclaim liberty to captives,</span><br />
<span>sight to the blind,</span><br />
<span>to let the oppressed go free,</span><br />
<span>to proclaim a year of favour from the Lord.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He then rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the assistant and sat down. And all eyes in the synagogue were fixed on him. Then he began to speak to them, “This text is being fulfilled today even while you are listening”. And he won the approval of all, and they were astonished by the gracious words that came from his lips. </p>

<p>They said, “This is Joseph’s son, surely?”. </p>

<p>But he replied, “No doubt you will quote me the saying, ‘Physician, heal yourself’, and tell me, ‘We have heard all that happened in Capernaum, do the same here in your own country’”. And he went on, “In truth I tell you, no prophet is ever accepted in his own country. </p>

<p>“There were many widows in Israel, I can assure you, in Elijah’s day, when heaven remained shut for three years and six months and a great famine raged throughout the land, but Elijah was not sent to any one of these: he was sent <i>to a widow at Zarephath, a town in Sidonia</i>. And in the prophet Elisha’s time there were many suffering from virulent skin-diseases in Israel, but none of these was cured — only Naaman the Syrian”.</p>

<p>When they heard this everyone in the synagogue was enraged. They sprang to their feet and hustled him out of the town; and they took him up to the brow of the hill their town was built on, intending to throw him off the cliff, but he passed straight through the crowd and walked away”.</p>


<h4>Jesus teaches in Caparnaum and cures a demoniac (4:31–37)</h4>

<p>He went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and taught them on the Sabbath. And his teaching made a deep impression on them because his word carried authority. In the synagogue there was a man possessed by the spirit of an unclean devil, and he shouted at the top of his voice, “Ha! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are: the Holy One of God”. </p>

<p>But Jesus rebuked it, saying, “Be quiet! Come out of him!”. And the devil, throwing the man into the middle, went out of him without hurting him at all. </p>

<p>Astonishment seized them and they were all saying to one another, “What is it in his words? He gives orders to unclean spirits with authority and power and they come out”. And the news of him travelled all through the surrounding countryside.</p>

<h4>Cure of Simon’s mother-in-law (4:38–39)</h4>

<p>Leaving the synagogue he went to Simon’s house. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was in the grip of a high fever and they asked him to do something for her. Standing over her he rebuked the fever and it left her. And she immediately got up and began to serve them. </p>

<h4>A number of cures (4:40–41)</h4>

<p>At sunset all those who had friends suffering from diseases of one kind or another brought them to him, and laying his hands on each he cured them. Devils too came out of many people, shouting, “You are the Son of God”. But he warned them and would not allow them to speak because they knew that he was the Christ.</p>

<h4>Dawn departure from Capernaum and travels through Judaea (4:42–44)</h4>

<p>When daylight came he left the house and made his way to a lonely place. The crowds went to look for him, and when they had caught up with him they wanted to prevent him leaving them, but he answered, “I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns too, because that is what I was sent to do”. And he continued his proclamation in the synagogues of Judaea. </p>

<h4>The first four disciples are called (5:1–11)</h4>

<p>Now it happened that he was standing one day by the Lake of Gennesaret, with the crowd pressing around him listening to the word of God, when he caught sight of two boats at the water’s edge. The fishermen had got out of them and were washing their nets. He got into one of the boats — it was Simon’s — and asked him to put out a little from the shore. Then he sat down and taught the crowds from the boat.</p>

<p>When he had finished speaking he said to Simon, “Put out into deep water and pay out your nets for a catch”.</p>

<p>Simon replied, “Master, we worked hard all night long and caught nothing, but if you say so, I will pay out the nets”. And when they had done this they netted such a huge number of fish that their nets began to tear, so they signalled to their companions in the other boat to come and help them; when these came, they filled both boats to sinking point.</p>

<p>When Simon Peter saw this he fell at the knees of Jesus saying, “Leave me, Lord; I am a sinful man”. For he and all his companions were completely awestruck at the catch they had made; so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were Simon’s partners. </p>

<p>But Jesus said to Simon, “Do not be afraid; from now on it is people you will be catching”. Then, bringing their boats back to land they left everything and followed him.</p>

<h4>Cure of a man suffering from a virulent skin-disease (5:12–16)</h4>

<p>Now it happened that Jesus was in one of the towns when suddenly a man appeared, covered with a skin-disease. Seeing Jesus he fell on his face and implored him saying, “Sir, if you are willing you can cleanse me”. </p>

<p>He stretched out his hand, and touched him saying, “I am willing. Be cleansed”. At once the skin-disease left him. He ordered him to tell no one, “But go and show yourself to the priest and make the offering for your cleansing just as Moses prescribed, as evidence to them”. </p>

<p>But the news of him kept spreading, and large crowds would gather to hear him and to have their illnesses cured, but he would go off to some deserted place and pray. </p>

<h4>Cure of a paralytic (5:17–26)</h4>

<p>Now it happened that he was teaching one day, and Pharisees and teachers of the Law, who had come from every village in Galilee, from Judaea and from Jerusalem, were sitting there. And the power of the Lord was there so that he should heal. And now some men appeared, bringing on a bed a paralysed man whom they were trying to bring in and lay down in front of him. But as they could find no way of getting the man through the crowd, they went up onto the top of the house and lowered him and his stretcher down through the tiles into the middle of the gathering, in front of Jesus. Seeing their faith he said, “My friend, your sins are forgiven you”. The scribes and the Pharisees began to think this over. </p>

<p>“Who is this man, talking blasphemy? Who but God alone can forgive sins?”. </p>

<p>But Jesus, aware of their thoughts, made them this reply, “What are these thoughts you have in your hearts? Which of these is easier: to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you’, or to say, ‘Get up and walk’? But to prove to you that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins”, — he said to the paralysed man — “l order you: get up, and pick up your stretcher and go home”. And immediately before their very eyes he got up, picked up what he had been lying on and went home praising God. </p>

<p>They were all astounded and praised God and were filled with awe, saying, “We have seen strange things today”. </p>

<h4>The call of Levi (5:27–28)</h4>

<p>When he went out after this, he noticed a tax collector, Levi by name, sitting at the tax office, and said to him, “Follow me”. And leaving everything Levi got up and followed him. </p>

<h4>Eating with sinners in Levi’s house (5:29–32)</h4>

<p>In his honour Levi held a great reception in his house, and with them at table was a large gathering of tax collectors and others. The Pharisees and their scribes complained to his disciples and said, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”. </p>

<p>Jesus said to them in reply, “It is not those that are well who need the doctor, but the sick. I have come to call not the upright but sinners to repentance”. </p>

<h4>Discussion on fasting (5:33–39)</h4>

<p>They then said to him, “John’s disciples are always fasting and saying prayers, and the disciples of the Pharisees, too, but yours go on eating and drinking”. </p>

<p>Jesus replied, “Surely you cannot make the bridegroom’s attendants fast while the bridegroom is still with them? But the time will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them; then, in those days, they will
fast”. </p>

<p>He also told them a parable, “No one tears a piece from a new cloak to put it on an old cloak; otherwise, not only will the new one be torn, but the piece taken from the new will not match the old. </p>

<p>“And nobody puts new wine in old wineskins; otherwise, the new wine will burst the skins and run to waste, and the skins will be ruined. No; new wine must be put in fresh skins. And nobody who has been drinking old wine wants new. ‘The old is good’, he says”. </p>

<h4>Picking corn on the Sabbath (6:1–5)</h4>

<p>It happened that one Sabbath he was walking through the cornfields, and his disciples were picking ears of corn, rubbing them in their hands and eating them. Some of the Pharisees said, “Why are you doing something that is forbidden on the Sabbath day?”. </p>

<p>Jesus answered them, “So you have not read what David did when he and his followers were hungry — how he went into the house of God and took the loaves of the offering and ate them and gave them to his followers, loaves which the priests alone are allowed to eat?”.  And he said to them, “The Son of man is master of the Sabbath”. </p>

<h4>Cure of the man with a withered hand (6:6–11)</h4>

<p>Now on another Sabbath he went into the synagogue and began to teach, and a man was present, and his right hand was withered. The scribes and the Pharisees were watching him to see if he would cure somebody on the Sabbath, hoping to find something to charge him with. But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man with the withered hand, “Get up and stand out in the middle!”. And he came forward and stood there. Then Jesus said to them, “I put it to you: is it permitted on the Sabbath to do good, or to do evil; to save life, or to destroy it?”. Then he looked around at them all and said to the man, “Stretch out your hand”. He did so, and his hand was restored. But they were furious and began to discuss the best way of dealing with Jesus. </p>

<h4>The choice of the Twelve (6:12–16)</h4>

<p>Now it happened in those days that he went onto the mountain to pray; and he spent the whole night in prayer to God. When day came he summoned his disciples and picked out twelve of them; he called them ‘apostles’: Simon whom he called Peter, and his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon called the Zealot, Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot who became a traitor. </p>

<h4>The crowds follow Jesus (6:17–19)</h4>

<p>He then came down with them and stopped at a piece of level ground where there was a large gathering of his disciples, with a great crowd of people from all parts of Judaea and Jerusalem and the coastal region of Tyre and Sidon who had come to hear him and to be cured of their diseases. People tormented by unclean spirits were also cured, and everyone in the crowd was trying to touch him because power came out of him that cured them all. </p>

<h4>The first sermon. The Beatitudes (6:20–23)</h4>

<p>Then fixing his eyes on his disciples he said: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>How blessed are you who are poor: the kingdom of God is yours.</span><br />
<span>Blessed are you who are hungry now: you shall have your fill.</span><br />
<span>Blessed are you who are weeping now: you shall laugh. </span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Blessed are you when people hate you, drive you out, abuse you, denounce your name as criminal, on account of the Son of man. Rejoice when that day comes and dance for joy, look! — your reward will be great in heaven. This was
the way their ancestors treated the prophets. </p>

<h4>The curses (6:24–26)</h4>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>But alas for you who are rich: you are having your consolation now.</span><br />
<span>Alas for you who have plenty to eat now: you shall go hungry.</span><br />
<span>Alas for you who are laughing now: you shall mourn and weep. </span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Alas for you when everyone speaks well of you! This was the way their ancestors treated the false prophets. </p>

<h4>Love of enemies (6:27–35)</h4>

<p>“But I say this to you who are listening: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who treat you badly. To anyone who slaps you on one cheek, present the other cheek as well; to anyone who takes your cloak from you, do not refuse your tunic. Give to everyone who asks you, and do not ask for your property back from someone who takes it. Treat others as you would like people to treat you. If you love those who love you, what credit can you expect? Even sinners love those who love them. And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit can you expect? For even sinners do that much. And if you lend to those from whom you hope to get money back, what credit can you expect? Even sinners lend to sinners to get back the same amount. Instead, love your enemies and do good to them, and lend without any hope of return. You will have a great reward, and you will be children of the Most High, for he himself is kind to the ungrateful and the wicked. </p>

<h4>Compassion and generosity (6:36–38)</h4>

<p>“Be compassionate just as your Father is compassionate. Do not judge, and you will not be judged; do not condemn, and you will not be condemned; forgive, and you will be forgiven. Give, and there will be gifts for you: a full measure, pressed down, shaken together, and overflowing, will be poured into your lap; because the standard you use will be the standard used for you”. </p>

<h4>Integrity (6:39–45)</h4>

<p>He also told them a parable, “Can one blind person guide another? Surely both will fall into a pit? Disciple is not superior to teacher; but fully trained disciple will be like teacher. Why do you observe the splinter in your brother’s eye and never notice the great log in your own? How can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me take out that splinter in your eye’, when you cannot see the great log in your own? Hypocrite! Take the log out of your own eye first, and then you will see clearly enough to take out the splinter in your brother’s eye. </p>

<p>“There is no sound tree that produces rotten fruit, nor again a rotten tree that produces sound fruit. Every tree can be told by its own fruit: people do not pick figs from thorns, nor gather grapes from brambles. Good people draw what is good from the store of goodness in their hearts; bad people draw what is bad from the store of badness. For the words of the mouth flow out of what fills the heart. </p>

<h4>The true disciple (6:46–49)</h4>

<p>“Why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord’, and not do what I say? </p>

<p>“Everyone who comes to me and listens to my words and acts on them — I will show you what such a person is like. Such a person is like the man who, when he built a house, dug, and dug deep, and laid the foundations on rock; when the river was in flood it bore down on that house but could not shake it, it was so well built. But someone who listens and does nothing is like the man who built a house on soil, with no foundations; as soon as the river bore down on it, it collapsed; and what a ruin that house became!”. </p>

<h4>Cure of the centurion’s servant (7:1–10)</h4>

<p>When he had come to the end of all he wanted the people to hear, he went into Capernaum. A centurion there had a servant, a favourite of his, who was sick and near death. Having heard about Jesus he sent some Jewish elders to him to ask him to come and heal his servant. When they came to Jesus they pleaded earnestly with him saying, “He deserves this of you, because he is well disposed towards our people; he built us our synagogue himself”. </p>

<p>So Jesus went with them, and was not very far from the house when the centurion sent word to him by some friends to say to him, “Sir, do not put yourself to any trouble because I am not worthy to have you under my roof; and that is why I did not presume to come to you myself; let my boy be cured by your giving the word. For I am under authority myself, and have soldiers under me; and I say to one man, ‘Go’, and he goes; to another, ‘Come here’, and he comes; to my servant, ‘Do this’, and he does it”. </p>

<p>When Jesus heard these words he was astonished at him and, turning around, said to the crowd following him, “I tell you, not even in Israel have I found faith as great as this”. And when the messengers got back to the house they found the servant in perfect health. </p>

<h4>The son of the widow Nain restored to life (7:11–17)</h4>

<p>It happened that soon afterwards he went to a town called Nain, accompanied by his disciples and a great number of people. Now when he was near the gate of the town there was a dead man being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. And a considerable number of the townspeople was with her. When the Lord saw her he felt sorry for her and said to her, “Don’t cry”. Then he went up and touched the bier and the bearers stood still, and he said, “Young man, I tell you: get up”. And the dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him to his mother. </p>

<p>Everyone was filled with awe and glorified God saying, “A great prophet has risen up among us; God has visited his people”. And this view of him spread throughout Judaea and all over the countryside. </p>

<h4>The Baptist’s question. Jesus commends him (7:18–30)</h4>

<p>The disciples of John gave him all this news, and John, summoning two of his disciples, sent them to the Lord to ask, “Are you the one who is to come, or are we to expect someone else?”. </p>

<p>When the men reached Jesus they said, “John the Baptist has sent us to you to ask, ‘Are you the one who is to come or are we to expect someone else?’” At that very time he cured many people of diseases and afflictions and of evil spirits, and gave the gift of sight to many who were blind. </p>

<p>Then he gave the messengers their answer, “Go back and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind see again, the lame walk, those suffering from virulent skin-diseases are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised to life, the good news is proclaimed to the poor; and blessed is anyone who does not find me a cause of falling”. </p>

<p>When John’s messengers had gone he began to talk to the people about John, “What did you go out into the desert to see? A reed swaying in the breeze? No! Then what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? Look, those who go in magnificent clothes and live luxuriously are to be found at royal courts! Then what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and much more than a prophet: he is the one of whom scripture says: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>Look, I am going to send my messenger in front of you</span><br />
<span>to prepare your way before you. </span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“I tell you, of all the children born to women, there is no one greater than John; yet the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he”. All the people who heard him, and the tax collectors too, acknowledged God’s saving justice by accepting baptism from John; but by refusing baptism from him the Pharisees and the lawyers thwarted God’s plan for them. </p>

<h4>Jesus condemns his contemporaries (7:31–35)</h4>

<p>“What comparison, then, can I find for the people of this generation? What are they like? They are like children shouting to one another while they sit in the market place: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>We played the pipes for you,</span><br />
<span>and you wouldn’t dance;</span><br />
<span>we sang dirges,</span><br />
<span>and you wouldn’t cry. </span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“For John the Baptist has come, not eating bread, not drinking wine, and you say, ‘He is possessed’. The Son of man has come, eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners’. Yet wisdom is justified by all her children”. </p>

<h4>The woman who was a sinner (7:36–50)</h4>

<p>One of the Pharisees invited him to a meal. When he arrived at the Pharisee’s house and took his place at table, suddenly a woman came in, who had a bad name in the town. She had heard he was dining with the Pharisee and had brought with her an alabaster jar of ointment. She waited behind him at his feet, weeping, and her tears fell on his feet, and she wiped them away with her hair; then she covered his feet with kisses and anointed them with the ointment. When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet, he would know who this woman is and what sort of person it is who is touching him and what a bad name she has”. </p>

<p>Then Jesus took him up and said, “Simon, I have something to say to you”. </p>

<p>He replied, “Say on, Master”. </p>

<p>“There was once a creditor who had two men in his debt; one owed him five hundred denarii, the other fifty.  were unable to pay, so he let them both off. Which of them will love him more?”. </p>

<p>Simon answered, “The one who was let off more, I suppose”. </p>

<p>Jesus said, “You are right”. </p>

<p>Then he turned to the woman and said to Simon, “You see this woman? I came into your house, and you poured no water over my feet, but she has poured out her tears over my feet and wiped them away with her hair. You gave me no kiss, but she has been covering my feet with kisses ever since I came in. You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment. For this reason I tell you that her sins, many as they are, have been forgiven her, because she has shown such great love. It is someone who is forgiven little who shows little love”. Then he said to her, “Your sins are forgiven”. </p>

<p>Those who were with him at table began to say to themselves, “Who is this man, that even forgives sins?”. </p>

<p>But he said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you; go in peace”. </p>

<h4>The women accompanying Jesus (8:1–3)</h4>

<p>Now it happened that after this he made his way through towns and villages preaching and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. With him went the Twelve, as well as certain women who had been cured of evil spirits and ailments: Mary surnamed the Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out, Joanna the wife of Herod’s steward Chuza, Susanna, and many others who provided for them out of their own resources. </p>

<h4>Parable of the sower (8:4–8)</h4>

<p>With a large crowd gathering and people from every town finding their way to him, he told this parable: </p>

<p>“A sower went out to sow his seed. Now as he sowed, some fell on the edge of the path and was trampled on; and the birds of the air ate it up. Some seed fell on rock, and when it came up it withered away, having no moisture. Some seed fell in the middle of thorns and the thorns grew with it and choked it. And some seed fell into good soil and grew and produced its crop a hundredfold”. Saying this he cried, “Anyone who has ears for listening should listen!”. </p>

<h4>Why Jesus speaks in parables (8:9–10)</h4>

<p>His disciples asked him what this parable might mean, and he said, “To you is granted to understand the secrets of the kingdom of God; for the rest it remains in parables, so that </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>they may look but not perceive,</span><br />
<span>listen but not understand. </span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>The parable of the sower explained (8:11–15)</h4>

<p>“This, then, is what the parable means: the seed is the word of God. Those on the edge of the path are people who have heard it, and then the devil comes and carries away the word from their hearts in case they should believe and be saved. Those on the rock are people who, when they first hear it, welcome the word with joy. But these have no root; they believe for a while, and in time of trial they give up. As for the part that fell into thorns, this is people who have heard, but as they go on their way they are choked by the worries and riches and pleasures of life and never produce any crops. As for the part in the rich soil, this is people with a noble and generous heart who have heard the word and take it to themselves and yield a harvest through their perseverance. </p>

<h4>Parable of the lamp (8:16–18)</h4>

<p>“No one lights a lamp to cover it with a bowl or to put it under a bed. No, it is put on a lamp-stand so that people may see the light when they come in. For nothing is hidden but it will be made clear, nothing secret but it will be made known and brought to light. So take care how you listen; anyone who has, will be given more; anyone who has not, will be deprived even of what he thinks he has”. </p>


<h4>The true family of Jesus (8:19–21)</h4>

<p>His mother and his brothers came looking for him, but they could not get to him because of the crowd. He was told, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside and want to see you”. </p>

<p>But he said in answer, “My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and put it into practice”. </p>

<h4>The calming of the storm (8:22–25)</h4>

<p>It happened that one day he got into a boat with his disciples and said to them, “Let us cross over to the other side of the lake”. So they set out, and as they sailed he fell asleep. When a squall of wind came down on the lake the boat started shipping water and they found themselves in danger. </p>

<p>So they went to rouse him saying, “Master! Master! We are lost!”. Then he woke up and rebuked the wind and the rough water; and they subsided and it was calm again. </p>

<p>He said to them, “Where is your faith?”. </p>

<p>They were awestruck and astounded and said to one another, “Who can this be, that gives orders even to winds and waves and they obey him?”. </p>

<h4>The Gerasene demoniac (8:26–39)</h4>

<p>They came to land in the territory of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee. He was stepping ashore when a man from the city who was possessed by devils came towards him; for a long time the man had been living with no clothes on, not in a house, but in the tombs. </p>

<p>Catching sight of Jesus he gave a shout, fell at his feet and cried out at the top of his voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, son of the Most High God? I implore you, do not torture me”. For Jesus had been telling the unclean spirit to come out of the man. It had seized on him a great many times, and then they used to secure him with chains and fetters to restrain him, but he would always break the fastenings, and the devil would drive him out into the wilds. </p>

<p>Jesus asked him, “What is your name?”. </p>

<p>He said, “Legion” — because many devils had gone into him. And these begged him not to order them to depart into the Abyss. </p>

<p>Now there was a large herd of pigs feeding there on the mountain, and the devils begged him to let them go into these. So he gave them leave. The devils came out of the man and went into the pigs, and the herd charged down the cliff into the lake and was drowned. </p>

<p>When the swineherds saw what had happened they ran off and told their story in the city and in the country around about; and the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus they found the man from whom the devils had gone out sitting at the feet of Jesus, wearing clothes and in his right mind; and they were afraid. Those who had witnessed it told them how the man who had been possessed came to be saved. The entire population of the Gerasene territory was in great fear and asked Jesus to leave them. So he got into the boat and went back. </p>

<p>The man from whom the devils had gone out asked to be allowed to stay with him, but he sent him away saying, “Go back home and report all that God has done for you”. So the man went off and proclaimed throughout the city all that Jesus had done for him. </p>

<h4>Cure of the woman with a haemorrhage. Jairus’ daughter raised to life (8:40–56)</h4>

<p>On his return Jesus was welcomed by the crowd, for they were all there waiting for him. And suddenly there came a man named Jairus, who was president of the synagogue. He fell at Jesus’ feet and pleaded with him to come to his house, because he had an only daughter about twelve years old, who was dying. And the crowds were almost stifling Jesus as he went. </p>

<p>Now there was a woman suffering from a haemorrhage for the past twelve years, whom no one had been able to cure. She came up behind him and touched the fringe of his cloak; and the haemorrhage stopped at that very moment. Jesus said, “Who was it that touched me?”. </p>

<p>When they all denied it, Peter said, “Master, it is the crowds around you, pushing”. </p>

<p>But Jesus said, “Somebody touched me. I felt that power had gone out from me”. Seeing herself discovered, the woman came forward trembling, and falling at his feet explained in front of all the people why she had touched him and how she had been cured at that very moment. “My daughter”, he said, “your faith has saved you; go in peace”. </p>

<p>While he was still speaking, someone arrived from the house of the president of the synagogue to say, “Your daughter has died. Do not trouble the Master any further”. </p>

<p>But Jesus heard this, and he spoke to the man, “Do not be afraid, only have faith and she will be saved”. When he came to the house he allowed no one to go in with him except Peter and John and James, and the child’s father and mother. They were all crying and mourning for her, but Jesus said, “Stop crying; she is not dead, but asleep”. But they ridiculed him, knowing she was dead. But taking her by the hand himself he spoke to her, “Child, get up”. And her spirit returned and she got up at that very moment. Then he told them to give her something to eat. Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened. </p>

<h4>The mission of the Twelve (9:1–6)</h4>

<p>He called the Twelve together and gave them power and authority over all devils and to cure diseases, and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal. He said to them, “Take nothing for the journey: neither staff, nor haversack, nor bread, nor money; and do not have a spare tunic. Whatever house you enter, stay there; and when you leave let your departure be from there. As for those who do not welcome you, when you leave their town shake the dust from your feet as evidence against them”. So they set out and went from village to village proclaiming the good news and healing everywhere. </p>

<h4>Herod and Jesus (9:7–9)</h4>

<p>Meanwhile Herod the tetrarch had heard about all that was going on; and he was puzzled, because some people were saying that John had risen from the dead, others that Elijah had reäppeared, still others that one of the ancient prophets had come back to life. But Herod said, “John? I beheaded him. So who is this I hear such reports about?”. And he was anxious to see him. </p>

<h4>The return of the apostles. Miracle of the loaves (9:10–17)</h4>

<p>On their return the apostles gave him an account of all they had done. Then he took them with him and withdrew towards a town called Bethsaida where they could be by themselves. But the crowds got to know and they went after him. He made them welcome and talked to them about the kingdom of God; and he cured those who were in need of healing. </p>

<p>It was late afternoon when the Twelve came up to him and said, “Send the people away, and they can go to the villages and farms around about to find lodging and food; for we are in a lonely place here”. </p>

<p>He replied, “Give them something to eat yourselves”. </p>

<p>But they said, “We have no more than five loaves and two fish, unless we are to go ourselves and buy food for all these people”. For there were about five thousand men. </p>

<p>But he said to his disciples, “Get them to sit down in parties of about fifty”. They did so and made them all sit down. Then he took the five loaves and the two fish, raised his eyes to heaven, and said the blessing over them; then he broke them and handed them to his disciples to distribute among the crowd. They all ate as much as they wanted, and when the scraps left over were collected they filled twelve baskets. </p>

<h4>Peter’s profession of faith (9:18–21)</h4>

<p>Now it happened that he was praying alone, and his disciples came to him and he put this question to them, “Who do the crowds say I am?”. </p>

<p>And they answered, “Some say John the Baptist; others Elijah; others again one of the ancient prophets come back to life”. </p>

<p>“But you”, he said to them, “who do you say I am?”. It was Peter who spoke up. </p>

<p>“The Christ of God”, he said. But he gave them strict orders and charged them not to say this to anyone. </p>

<h4>First prophecy of the passion (9:22)</h4>

<p>He said, “The Son of man is destined to suffer grievously, to be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes and to be put to death, and to be raised up on the third day”. </p>

<h4>The condition of following Christ (9:23–26)</h4>

<p>Then, speaking to all, he said, “If anyone wants to be a follower of mine, let him renounce himself and take up his cross every day and follow me. Anyone who wants to save his life will lose it; but anyone who loses his life for my sake, will save it. What benefit is it to anyone to win the whole world and forfeit or lose his very self? For if anyone is ashamed of me and of my words, of him the Son of man will be ashamed when he comes in his own glory and in the glory of the Father and the holy angels. </p>

<h4>The kingdom will come soon (9:27)</h4>

<p>“I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God”. </p>

<h4>The transfiguration (9:28–36)</h4>

<p>Now about eight days after this had been said, he took with him Peter, John and James and went up the mountain to pray. And it happened that, as he was praying, the aspect of his face was changed and his clothing became sparkling white. And suddenly there were two men talking to him; they were Moses and Elijah appearing in glory, and they were speaking of his passing which he was to accomplish in Jerusalem. Peter and his companions were heavy with sleep, but they woke up and saw his glory and the two men standing with him. As these were leaving him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is wonderful for us to be here; so let us make three shelters, one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah”. He did not know what he was saying. As he was saying this, a cloud came and covered them with shadow; and when they went into the
cloud the disciples were afraid. </p>

<p>And a voice came from the cloud saying, “This is my Son, the Chosen One. Listen to him”. And after the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. The disciples kept silence and, at that time, told no one what they had seen. </p>

<h4>The epileptic demoniac (9:37–43a)</h4>

<p>Now it happened that on the following day when they were coming down from the mountain a large crowd came to meet him. And suddenly a man in the crowd cried out. “Master”, he said, “I implore you to look at my son: he is my only child. A spirit will suddenly take hold of him, and all at once it gives a sudden cry and throws the boy into convulsions with foaming at the mouth; it is slow to leave him, but when it does, it leaves the boy worn out. I begged your disciples to drive it out, and they could not”. </p>

<p>In reply Jesus said, “Faithless and perverse generation! How much longer must I be among you and put up with you? Bring your son here”. Even while the boy was coming, the devil threw him to the ground in convulsions. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and cured the boy and gave him back to his father, and everyone was awestruck by the greatness of God. </p>

<h4>Second prophecy of the passion (9:43b–45)</h4>

<p>But while everyone was full of admiration for all he did, he said to his disciples, “For your part, you must have these words constantly in mind: The Son of man is going to be delivered into the power of men”. But they did not understand what he said; it was hidden from them so that they should not see the meaning of it, and they were afraid to ask him about it. </p>

<h4>Who is the greatest? (9:46–48)</h4>

<p>An argument started between them about which of them was the greatest. Jesus knew what thoughts were going through their minds, and he took a little child whom he set by his side and then he said to them, “Anyone who welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me; and anyone who welcomes me, welcomes the one who sent me. The least among you all is the one who is the greatest”. </p>

<h4>On using the name of Jesus (9:49–50)</h4>

<p>John spoke up. “Master”, he said, “we saw someone driving out devils in your name, and because he is not with us we tried to stop him”. </p>

<p>But Jesus said to him, “You must not stop him: anyone who is not against you is for you”. </p>

<h2 id="iv">IV: The Journey to Jerusalem (9:51–19:27)</h2>

<h4>A Samaritan village is inhospitable (9:51–56)</h4>

<p>Now it happened that as the time drew near for him to be taken up, he resolutely turned his face towards Jerusalem and sent messengers ahead of him. These set out, and they went into a Samaritan village to make preparations for him, but the people would not receive him because he was making for Jerusalem. Seeing this, the disciples James and John said, “Lord, do you want us to call down fire from heaven to burn them up?”. But he turned and rebuked them, and they went on to another village. </p>

<h4>Hardships of the apostolic calling (9:57–62)</h4>

<p>As they travelled along they met a man on the road who said to him, “I will follow you wherever you go”. </p>

<p>Jesus answered, “Foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head”. </p>

<p>Another to whom he said, “Follow me”, replied, “Let me go and bury my father first”. </p>

<p>But he answered, “Leave the dead to bury their dead; your duty is to go and spread the news of the kingdom of God”. </p>

<p>Another said, “I will follow you, sir, but first let me go and say good-bye to my people at home”. </p>

<p>Jesus said to him, “Once the hand is laid on the plough, no one who looks back is fit for the kingdom of God”. </p>

<h4>The mission of the seventy-two disciples (10:1–16)</h4>

<p>After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them out ahead of him in pairs, to all the towns and places he himself would be visiting. And he said to them, “The harvest is rich but the labourers are few, so ask the Lord of the harvest to send labourers to do his harvesting. Start off now, but look, I am sending you out like lambs among wolves. Take no purse with you, no haversack, no sandals. Salute no one on the road. Whatever house you enter, let your first words be, ‘Peace to this house!’ . And if a man of peace lives there, your peace will go and rest on him; if not, it will come back to you. Stay in the same house, taking what food and drink they have to offer, for the labourer deserves his wages; do not move from house to house. Whenever you go into a town where they make you welcome, eat what is put before you. Cure those in it who are sick, and say, ‘The kingdom of God is very near to you’. But whenever you enter a town and they do not make you welcome, go out into its streets and say, ‘We wipe off the very dust of your town that clings to our feet, and leave it with you. Yet be sure of this: the kingdom of God is very near’. I tell you, on the great Day it will be more bearable for Sodom than for that town. </p>

<p>“Alas for you, Chorazin! Alas for you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. And still, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the Judgement than for you. And as for you, Capernaum, did you want to be <i>raised high as heaven? You shall be flung down to hell</i>. </p>

<p>“Anyone who listens to you listens to me; anyone who rejects you rejects me, and those who reject me reject the one who sent me”. </p>

<h4>True cause for the apostles to rejoice (10:17–20)</h4>

<p>The seventy-two came back rejoicing. “Lord”, they said, “even the devils submit to us when we use your name”. </p>

<p>He said to them, “I watched Satan fall like lightning from heaven. Look, I have given you power to tread down serpents and scorpions and the whole strength of the enemy; nothing shall ever hurt you. Yet do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you; rejoice instead that your names are written in
heaven”. </p>

<h4>The good news revealed to the simple. The Father and the Son (10:21–22)</h4>

<p>Just at this time, filled with joy by the Holy Spirit, he said, “I bless you, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth, for hiding these things from the learned and the clever and revealing them to little children. Yes, Father, for that is what it has pleased you to do. Everything has been entrusted to me by my Father; and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him”. </p>

<h4>The privilege of the disciples (10:23–24)</h4>

<p>Then turning to his disciples he spoke to them by themselves, “Blessed are the eyes that see what you see, for I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see, and never saw it; to hear what you hear, and never heard it”. </p>

<h4>The great commandment (10:25–28)</h4>

<p>And now a lawyer stood up and, to test him, asked, “Master, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”. </p>

<p>He said to him, “What is written in the Law? What is your reading of it?”. </p>

<p>He replied, “<i>You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbour as yourself</i>”. </p>

<p>Jesus said to him, “You have answered right, do this and life is yours”. </p>

<h4>Parable of the good Samaritan (10:29–37)</h4>

<p>But the man was anxious to justify himself and said to Jesus, “And who is my neighbour?”. </p>

<p>In answer Jesus said, “A man was once on his way down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell into the hands of bandits; they stripped him, beat him and then made off, leaving him half dead. Now a priest happened to be travelling down the same road, but when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. In the same way a Levite who came to the place saw him, and passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan traveller who came on him was moved with compassion when he saw him. He went up to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them. He then lifted him onto his own mount and took him to an inn and looked after him. Next day, he took out two denarii and handed them to the innkeeper and said, ‘Look after him, and on my way back I will make good any extra expense you have’. Which of these three, do you think, proved himself a neighbour to the man who fell into the bandits’ hands?”. </p>

<p>He replied, “The one who showed pity towards him”. </p>

<p>Jesus said to him, “Go, and do the same yourself”. </p>


<h4>Martha and Mary (10:38–42)</h4>

<p>In the course of their journey he came to a village, and a woman named Martha welcomed him into her house. She had a sister called Mary, who sat down at the Lord’s feet and listened to him speaking. Now Martha, who was distracted with all the serving, came to him and said, “Lord, do you not care that my sister is leaving me to do the serving all by myself? Please tell her to help me”. </p>

<p>But the Lord answered, “Martha, Martha”, he said, “you worry and fret about so many things, and yet few are needed, indeed only one. It is Mary who has chosen the better part, and it is not to be taken from her”. </p>

<h4>The Lord’s prayer (11:1–4)</h4>

<p>Now it happened that he was in a certain place praying, and when he had finished, one of his disciples said, “Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples”. </p>

<p>He said to them, “When you pray, this is what to say: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>Father, may your name be held holy,</span><br />
<span>your kingdom come;</span><br />
<span>give us each day our supersubstantial bread,</span><br />
<span>and forgive us our sins,</span><br />
<span>for we ourselves forgive each one who is in debt to us.</span><br />
<span>And do not put us to the test”.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>The importunate friend (11:5–8)</h4>

<p>He also said to them, “Suppose one of you has a friend and goes to him in the middle of the night to say, ‘My friend, lend me three loaves, because a friend of mine on his travels has just arrived at my house and I have nothing to offer him’; and the man answers from inside the house, ‘Do not bother me. The door is bolted now, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot get up to give it to you’. I you, if the man does not get up and give it to him for friendship’s sake, persistence will make him get up and give his friend all he wants. </p>

<h4>Effective prayer (11:9–13)</h4>

<p>“So I say to you: Ask, and it will be given to you; search, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; everyone who searches finds; everyone who knocks will have the
door opened. What father among you, if his son asked for a fish, would hand him a snake? Or if he asked for an egg, hand him a scorpion? If you then, evil as you are, know how to give your children what is good, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”. </p>

<h4>Jesus and Beelzebul (11:14–22)</h4>

<p>He was driving out a devil and it was dumb; and it happened that when the devil had gone out the dumb man spoke, and the people were amazed. But some of them said, “It is through Beelzebul, the prince of devils, that he drives devils out”. </p>

<p>Others asked him, as a test, for a sign from heaven; but, knowing what they were thinking, he said to them, “Any kingdom which is divided against itself is heading for ruin, and house collapses against house. So, too, with Satan: if he is divided against himself, how can his kingdom last? — since you claim that it is through Beelzebul that I drive devils out. Now if it is through Beelzebul that I drive devils out, through whom do your own sons drive them out? They shall be your judges, then. But if it is through the finger of God that I drive devils out, then the kingdom of God has indeed caught you unawares. So long as a strong man fully armed guards his own home, his goods are undisturbed; but when someone stronger than himself attacks and defeats him, the stronger man takes away all the weapons he relied on and shares out his spoil. </p>

<h4>No compromise (11:23)</h4>

<p>“Anyone who is not with me is against me; and anyone who does not gather in with me throws away. </p>

<h4>Return of the unclean spirit (11:24–26)</h4>

<p>“When an unclean spirit goes out of someone it wanders through waterless country looking for a place to rest, and not finding one it says, ‘I will go back to the home I came from’. But on arrival, finding it swept and tidied, it then goes off and brings seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and set up house there, and so that person ends up worse off than before”. </p>

<h4>The truly blessed (11:27–28)</h4>

<p>It happened that as he was speaking, a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said, “Blessed the womb that bore you and the breasts that fed you!” But he replied, “More blessed still are those who hear the word of God and keep it!”. </p>

<h4>The sign of Jonah (11:29–32)</h4>

<p>The crowds got even bigger and he addressed them, “This is an evil generation; it is asking for a sign. The only sign it will be given is the sign of Jonah. For just as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so will the Son of man be a sign to this generation. On Judgement Day the Queen of the South will stand up against the people of this generation and be their condemnation, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, look, there is something greater than Solomon here. On Judgement Day the men of Nineveh will appear against this generation and be its condemnation, because when Jonah preached they repented; and, look, there is something greater than Jonah here. </p>

<h4>The parable of the lamp repeated (11:33–36)</h4>

<p>“No one lights a lamp and puts it in some hidden place or under a tub; they put it on the lamp-stand so that people may see the light when they come in. The lamp of the body is your eye. When your eye is clear, your whole body, too, is filled with light; but when it is diseased your body, too, will be darkened. See to it then that the light inside you is not darkness. If, therefore, your whole body is filled with light, and not darkened at all, it will be light entirely, as when the lamp shines on you with its rays”. </p>

<h4>The Pharisees and the lawyers attacked (11:37–54)</h4>

<p>He had just finished speaking when a Pharisee invited him to dine at his house. He went in and sat down at table. The Pharisee saw this and was surprised that he had not first washed before the meal. But the Lord said to him, “You Pharisees! You clean the outside of cup and plate, while inside yourselves you are filled with extortion and wickedness. Fools! Did not he who made the outside make the inside too? Instead, give alms from what you have and, look, everything will be clean for you. But alas for you Pharisees, because you pay your tithe of mint and rue and all sorts of garden herbs and neglect justice and the love of God! These you should have practised, without neglecting the others. Alas for you Pharisees, because you like to take the seats of honour in the synagogues and to be greeted respectfully in the market squares! Alas for you, because you are like the unmarked tombs that people walk on without knowing it!”. </p>

<p>A lawyer then spoke up. “Master”, he said, “when you speak like this you insult us too”. </p>

<p>But he said, “Alas for you lawyers as well, because you load on people burdens that are unendurable, burdens that you yourselves do not touch with your fingertips. </p>

<p>“Alas for you because you build tombs for the prophets, the people your ancestors killed! In this way you both witness to what your ancestors did and approve it; they did the killing, you do the building. </p>

<p>“And that is why the Wisdom of God said, ‘I will send them prophets and apostles; some they will slaughter and persecute, so that this generation will have to answer for every prophet’s blood that has been shed since the
foundation of the world, from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the Temple’. Yes, I tell you, this generation will have to answer for it all. </p>

<p>“Alas for you lawyers who have taken away the key of knowledge! You have not gone in yourselves and have prevented others from going in who wanted to”. </p>

<p>When he left there, the scribes and the Pharisees began a furious attack on him and tried to force answers from him on innumerable questions, lying in wait to catch him out in something he might say. </p>

<h4>Open and fearless speech (12:1–12)</h4>

<p>Meanwhile the people had gathered in their thousands so that they were treading on one another. And he began to speak, first of all to his disciples. “Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees — their hypocrisy. Everything now covered up will be uncovered, and everything now hidden will be made clear. For this reason, whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in hidden places will be proclaimed from the housetops. </p>

<p>“To you my friends I say: Do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more. I will tell you whom to fear: fear him who, after he has killed, has the power to cast into hell. Yes, I tell you, he is the one to fear. Can you not buy five sparrows for two pennies? And yet not one is forgotten in God’s sight. Why, every hair on your head has been counted. There is no need to be afraid: you are worth more than many sparrows. </p>

<p>“I tell you, if anyone openly declares himself for me in the presence of human beings, the Son of man will declare himself for him in the presence of God’s angels. But anyone who disowns me in the presence of human beings will be disowned in the presence of God’s angels. </p>

<p>“Everyone who says a word against the Son of man will be forgiven, but no one who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will be forgiven. </p>

<p>“When they take you before synagogues and magistrates and authorities, do not worry about how to defend yourselves or what to say, because when the time comes, the Holy Spirit will teach you what you should say”. </p>

<h4>On hoarding possessions (12:13–21)</h4>

<p>A man in the crowd said to him, “Master, tell my brother to give me a share of our inheritance”. </p>

<p>He said to him, “My friend, who appointed me your judge, or the arbitrator of your claims?”. Then he said to them, “Watch, and be on your guard against avarice of any kind, for life does not consist in possessions, even when someone has more than he needs”. </p>

<p>Then he told them a parable, “There was once a rich man who, having had a good harvest from his land, thought to himself, ‘What am I to do? I have not enough room to store my crops’. Then he said, ‘This is what I will do: I will pull down my barns and build bigger ones, and store all my grain and my goods in them, and I will say to my soul: My soul, you have plenty of good things laid by for many years to come; take things easy, eat, drink, have a good time’. But God said to him, ‘Fool! This very night the demand will be made for your soul; and this hoard of yours, whose will it be then?’. So it is when someone stores up treasure for himself instead of becoming rich in the sight of God”. </p>

<h4>Trust in providence (12:22–31)</h4>

<p>Then he said to his disciples, “That is why I am telling you not to worry about your life and what you are to eat, nor about your body and how you are to clothe it. For life is more than food, and the body more than clothing. Think of the ravens. They do not sow or reap; they have no storehouses and no barns; yet God feeds them. And how much more you are worth than the birds! Can any of you, however much you worry, add a single cubit to your span of life? If a very small thing is beyond your powers, why worry about the rest? Think how the flowers grow; they never have to spin or weave; yet, I assure you, not even Solomon in all his royal robes was clothed like one of them. Now if that is how God clothes a flower which is growing wild today and is thrown into the furnace tomorrow, how much more will he look after you, who have so little faith! But you must not set your hearts on things to eat and things to drink; nor must you worry. It is the gentiles of this world who set their hearts on all these things. Your Father well knows you need them. No; set your hearts on his kingdom, and these other things will be given you as well. </p>

<p>“There is no need to be afraid, little flock, for it has pleased your Father to give you the kingdom. </p>

<h4>On almsgiving (12:33–34)</h4>

<p>“Sell your possessions and give to those in need. Get yourselves purses that do not wear out, treasure that will not fail you, in heaven where no thief can reach it and no moth destroy it. For wherever your treasure is, that is where your heart will be too. </p>

<h4>On being ready for the Master’s return (12:35–48)</h4>

<p>“See that you have your belts done up and your lamps lit. Be like people waiting for their master to return from the wedding feast, ready to open the door as soon as he comes and knocks. Blessed those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes. In truth I tell you, he will do up his belt, sit them down at table and wait on them. It may be in the second watch that he comes, or in the third, but blessed are those servants if he finds them ready. You may be quite sure of this, that if the householder had known at what time the burglar would come, he would not have let anyone break through the wall of his house. You too must stand ready, because the Son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect”. </p>

<p>Peter said, “Lord, do you mean this parable for us, or for everyone?”. </p>

<p>The Lord replied, “Who, then, is the wise and trustworthy steward whom the master will place over his household to give them at the proper time their allowance of food? Blessed that servant if his master’s arrival finds him doing exactly that. I tell you truly, he will put him in charge of everything that he owns. But if the servant says to himself, ‘My master is taking his time coming’, and sets about beating the menservants and the servant-girls, and eating and drinking and getting drunk, his master will come on a day he does not expect and at an hour he does not know. The master will cut him off and send him to the same fate as the unfaithful. </p>

<p>“The servant who knows what his master wants, but has got nothing ready and done nothing in accord with those wishes, will be given a great many strokes of the lash. The one who did not know, but has acted in such a way that he deserves a beating, will be given fewer strokes. When someone is given a great deal, a great deal will be demanded of that person; when someone is entrusted with a great deal, of that person even more will be expected. </p>

<h4>Jesus and his passion (12:49–50)</h4>

<p>“I have come to bring fire to the earth, and how I wish it were blazing already! There is a baptism I must still receive, and what constraint I am under until it is completed!”. </p>

<h4>Jesus the cause of dissension (12:51–53)</h4>

<p>“Do you suppose that I am here to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but rather division. For from now on, a household of five will be divided: three against two and two against three; father opposed to son, son to father, mother to daughter, daughter to mother, mother-in-law to daughter-in-law, daughter-in-law to mother-in-law”. </p>

<h4>On reading the signs of the times (12:54–59)</h4>

<p>He said again to the crowds, “When you see a cloud looming up in the west you say at once that rain is coming, and so it does. And when the wind is from the south you say it’s going to be hot, and it is. Hypocrites! You know how to interpret the face of the earth and the sky. How is it you do not know
how to interpret these times? </p>

<p>“Why not judge for yourselves what is upright? For example: when you are going to court with your opponent, make an effort to settle with him on the way, or he may drag you before the judge and the judge hand you over to the officer and the officer have you thrown into prison. I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the very last penny”. </p>

<h4>Examples inviting repentance (13:1–5)</h4>

<p>It was just about this time that some people arrived and told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with that of their sacrifices. At this he said to them, “Do you suppose that these Galileans were worse sinners than any others, that this should have happened to them? They were not, I tell you. No; but unless you repent you will all perish as they did. Or those eighteen on whom the tower at Siloam fell, killing them all? Do you suppose that they were more guilty than all the other people living in Jerusalem? They were not, I tell you. No; but unless you repent you will all perish as they did”. </p>

<h4>Parable of the barren fig tree (13:6–9)</h4>

<p>He told this parable, “A man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came looking for fruit on it but found none. He said to his vinedresser, ‘For three years now I have been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and finding none. Cut it down: why should it be taking up the ground?’. ‘Sir’, the man replied, ‘leave it one more year and give me time to dig around it and manure it: it may bear fruit next year; if not, then you can cut it down’”. </p>

<h4>Healing of a crippled man on the Sabbath (13:10–17)</h4>

<p>One Sabbath day he was teaching in one of the synagogues, and there before him was a woman who for eighteen years had been possessed by a spirit that crippled her; she was bent double and quite unable to stand upright. When Jesus saw her he called her over and said, “Woman, you are freed from your disability”, and he laid his hands on her. And at once she straightened up, and she glorified God. </p>

<p>But the president of the synagogue was indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, and he addressed all those present saying, “There are six days when work is to be done. Come and be healed on one of those days and not on the Sabbath”. </p>

<p>But the Lord answered him and said, “Hypocrites! Is there one of you who does not untie his ox or his donkey from the manger on the Sabbath and take it out for watering? And this woman, a daughter of Abraham whom Satan has held bound these eighteen years — was it not right to untie this bond on the Sabbath day?”. When he said this, all his adversaries were covered with confusion, and all the people were overjoyed at all the wonders he worked. </p>

<h4>The parable of the mustard seed (13:18–19)</h4>

<p>He went on to say, “What is the kingdom of God like? What shall I compare it with? It is like a mustard seed which a man took and threw into his garden: it grew and became a tree, and the birds of the air sheltered in its branches”. </p>

<h4>Parable of the yeast (13:20–21)</h4>

<p>Again he said, “What shall I compare the kingdom of God with? It is like the yeast a woman took and mixed in with three measures of flour until it was leavened all through”. </p>

<h4>The narrow door; rejection of the Jews, call of the gentiles (13:22–30)</h4>

<p>Through towns and villages he went teaching, making his way to Jerusalem. Someone said to him, “Sir, will there be only a few saved?”. </p>

<p>He said to them, “Try your hardest to enter by the narrow door, because, I tell you, many will try to enter and will not succeed. </p>

<p>“Once the master of the house has got up and locked the door, you may find yourself standing outside knocking on the door, saying, ‘Lord, open to us’, but he will answer, ‘I do not know where you come from’. Then you will start saying, ‘We once ate and drank in your company; you taught in our streets’, but he will reply, ‘I do not know where you come from; away from me, all evil doers!’. </p>

<p>“Then there will be weeping and grinding of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and yourselves thrown out. And people from east and west, from north and south, will come and sit down at the feast in the kingdom of God. </p>

<p>“Look, there are those now last who will be first, and those now first who will be last”. </p>

<h4>Herod the fox (13:31–33)</h4>

<p>Just at this time some Pharisees came up. “Go away”, they said. “Leave this place, because Herod means to kill you”. </p>

<p>He replied, “You may go and give that fox this message: Look! Today and tomorrow I drive out devils and heal, and on the third day I attain my end. But for today and tomorrow and the next day I must go on, since it would not be right for a prophet to die outside Jerusalem. </p>

<h4>Jerusalem admonished (13:34–35) </h4>

<p>“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you that kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you! How often have I longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you refused! Look! Your house will be left to you. Yes, I promise you, you shall not see me until the time comes
when you are saying: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>Blessed is he who is coming in the name of the Lord!”. </span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Healing of a dropsical man on the Sabbath (14:1–6)</h4>

<p>Now it happened that on a Sabbath day he had gone to share a meal in the house of one of the leading Pharisees; and they watched him closely. Now there in front of him was a man with dropsy, and Jesus addressed the lawyers and Pharisees with the words, “Is it against the law to cure someone on the Sabbath, or not?”. But they remained silent, so he took the man and cured him and sent him away. Then he said to them, “Which of you here, if his son falls into a well, or his ox, will not pull him out on a Sabbath day without any hesitation?”. And to this they could find no answer. </p>

<h4>On choosing places at the table (14:7–11)</h4>

<p>He then told the guests a parable, because he had noticed how they picked the places of honour. He said this, “When someone invites you to a wedding feast, do not take your seat in the place of honour. A more distinguished person than you may have been invited, and the person who invited you both may come and say, ‘Give up your place to this man’. And then, to your embarrassment, you will have to go and take the lowest place. No; when you are a guest, make your way to the lowest place and sit there, so that, when your host comes, he may say, ‘My friend, move up higher’. Then, everyone with you at the table will see you honoured. For everyone who raises himself up will be humbled, and the one who humbles himself will be raised up”. </p>

<h4>On choosing guests to be invited (14:12–14)</h4>

<p>Then he said to his host, “When you give a lunch or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relations or rich neighbours, in case they invite you back and so repay you. No; when you have a party, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind; then you will be blessed, for they have no means to repay you and so you will be repaid when the upright rise again”. </p>

<h4>The invited guests who made excuses (14:15–24)</h4>

<p>On hearing this, one of those gathered around the table said to him, “Blessed is anyone who will share the meal in the kingdom of God!”. </p>

<p>But he said to him, “There was a man who gave a great banquet, and he invited a large number of people. When the time for the banquet came, he sent his servant to say to those who had been invited, ‘Come along: everything is ready now’. But all alike started to make excuses. The first said, ‘I have bought a piece of land and must go and see it. Please accept my apologies’. Another said, ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen and am on my way to try them out. Please accept my apologies’. Yet another said, ‘I have just got married and so am unable to come’. </p>

<p>“The servant returned and reported this to his master. Then the householder, in a rage, said to his servant, ‘Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in here the poor, the crippled, the blind
and the lame’. ‘Sir’, said the servant, ‘your orders have been carried out and there is still room’. Then the master said to his servant, ‘Go to the open roads and the hedgerows and press people to come in, to make sure my house is full; because, I tell you, not one of those who were invited shall have a taste of my banquet’”. </p>

<h4>Renouncing all that one holds dear (14:25–27)</h4>

<p>Great crowds accompanied him on his way and he turned and spoke to them. “Anyone who comes to me without hating father, mother, wife, children, brothers, sisters, yes and his own life too, cannot be my disciple. No one who does not carry his cross and come after me can be my disciple”. </p>

<h4>Renouncing possessions (14:28–33)</h4>

<p>“And indeed, which of you here, intending to build a tower, would not first sit down and work out the cost to see if he had enough to complete it? Otherwise, if he laid the foundation and then found himself unable to finish the work, anyone who saw it would start making fun of him and saying, ‘Here is someone who started to build and was unable to finish’. Or again, what king marching to war against another king would not first sit down and consider whether with ten thousand men he could stand up to the other who was advancing against him with twenty thousand? If not, then while the other king was still a long way off, he would send envoys to sue for peace. So in the same way, none of you can be my disciple without giving up all that he owns. </p>

<h4>On loss of enthusiasm in a disciple (14:34–35)</h4>

<p>“Salt is a good thing. But if salt itself loses its taste, what can make it salty again? It is good for neither soil nor manure heap. People throw it away. Anyone who has ears for listening should listen!”. </p>

<h4>The three parables of God’s mercy (15:1–3)</h4>

<p>The tax collectors and sinners, however, were all crowding around to listen to him, and the Pharisees and scribes complained saying, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them”. So he told them this parable: </p>

<h4>The lost sheep (15:4–7)</h4>

<p>“Which one of you with a hundred sheep, if he lost one, would fail to leave the ninety-nine in the desert and go after the missing one until he found it? And when he found it, would he not joyfully take it on his shoulders and then, when he got home, call together his friends and neighbours, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with me, I have found my sheep that was lost’. In the same way, I tell you, there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner repenting than over ninety-nine upright people who have no need of repentance. </p>

<h4>The lost drachma (15:8–10)</h4>

<p>“Or again, what woman with ten drachmas would not, if she lost one, light a lamp and sweep out the house and search thoroughly until she found it? And then, when she had found it, call together her friends and neighbours, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with me, I have found the drachma I lost’. In the same way, I tell you, there is rejoicing among the angels of God over one repentant sinner”. </p>

<h4>The lost son (the ‘prodigal’) and the dutiful son (15:11–32)</h4>

<p>Then he said, “There was a man who had two sons. The younger one said to his father, ‘Father, let me have the share of the estate that will come to me’. A few days later, the younger son got together everything he had and left for a distant country where he squandered his money on a life of debauchery. </p>

<p>“When he had spent it all, that country experienced a severe famine, and now he began to feel the pinch; so he hired himself out to one of the local inhabitants who put him on his farm to feed the pigs. And he would willingly have filled himself with the husks the pigs were eating but no one would let him have them. Then he came to his senses and said, ‘How many of my father’s hired men have all the food they want and more, and here am I dying of hunger! I will leave this place and go to my father and say: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you; I no longer deserve to be called your son; treat me as one of your hired men’. So he left the place and went back to his father. </p>

<p>“While he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was moved with pity. He ran to the boy, clasped him in his arms and kissed him. Then his son said, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I no longer deserve to be called your son’. But the father said to his servants, ‘Quick! Bring out the best robe and put it on him; put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. Bring the calf we have been fattening, and kill it; we will celebrate by having a feast, because this son of mine was dead and has come back to life; he was lost and is found’. And they began to celebrate. </p>

<p>“Now the elder son was out in the fields, and on his way back, as he drew near the house, he could hear music and dancing. Calling one of the servants he asked what it was all about. The servant told him, ‘Your brother has come, and your father has killed the calf we had been fattening because he has got him back safe and sound’. He was angry then and refused to go in, and his father came out and began to urge him to come in; but he retorted to his father, ‘All these years I have slaved for you and never once disobeyed any orders of yours, yet you never offered me so much as a kid for me to celebrate with my friends. But, for this son of yours, when he comes back after swallowing up your property — he and his loose women — you kill the calf we had been fattening’. </p>

<p>“The father said, ‘My son, you are with me always and all I have is yours. But it was only right we should celebrate and rejoice, because your brother here was dead and has come to life; he was lost and is found’”. </p>

<h4>The crafty steward (16:1–8)</h4>

<p>He also said to his disciples, There was a rich man and he had a steward who was denounced to him for being wasteful with his property. He called for the man and said, ‘What is this I hear about you? Draw me up an account of your stewardship because you are not to be my steward any longer’. Then the steward said to himself, ‘Now that my master is taking the stewardship from me, what am I to do? Dig? I am not strong enough. Go begging? I should be too ashamed. Ah, I know what I will do to make sure that when I am dismissed from office there will be some to welcome me into their homes’. </p>

<p>“Then he called his master’s debtors one by one. To the first he said, ‘How much do you owe my master?’. ‘One hundred measures of oil’, he said. The steward said, ‘Here, take your bond; sit down and quickly write fifty’. To another he said, ‘And you, sir, how much do you owe?’. ‘One hundred measures of wheat’, he said. The steward said, ‘Here, take your bond and write eighty’. </p>

<p>“The master praised the dishonest steward for his astuteness. For the children of this world are more astute in dealing with their own kind than are the children of light. </p>

<h4>The right use of money (16:9–13)</h4>

<p>“And so I tell you this: use money, tainted as it is, to win you friends, and thus make sure that when it fails you, they will welcome you into eternal dwellings. Anyone who is trustworthy in little things is trustworthy in great; anyone who is dishonest in little things is dishonest in great. If then you are not trustworthy with money, that tainted thing, who will trust you with genuine riches? And if you are not trustworthy with what is not yours, who will give you what is your very own? </p>

<p>“No servant can be the slave of two masters: he will either hate the first and love the second, or be attached to the first and despise the second. You cannot be the slave both of God and of money”. </p>

<h4>Against the Pharisees and their love of money (16:14–15)</h4>

<p>The Pharisees, who loved money, heard all this and jeered at him. He said to them, “You are the very ones who pass yourselves off as upright in people’s sight, but God knows your hearts. For what is highly esteemed in human eyes is loathsome in the sight of God. </p>

<h4>The kingdom stormed (16:16)</h4>

<p>“Up to the time of John it was the Law and the Prophets; from then onwards, the kingdom of God has been preached, and everyone is forcing their way into it. </p>

<h4>The Law remains (16:17)</h4>

<p>“It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for one little stroke to drop out of the Law. </p>

<h4>Marriage indissoluble (16:18)</h4>

<p>“Everyone who divorces his wife and marries another is guilty of adultery, and the man who marries a woman divorced by her husband commits adultery. </p>

<h4>The parable of the rich man and Lazarus (16:19–31)</h4>

<p>“There was a rich man who used to dress in purple and fine linen and feast magnificently every day. And at his gate there used to lie a poor man called Lazarus, covered with sores, who longed to fill himself with what fell from the rich man’s table. Even dogs came and licked his sores. Now it happened that the poor man died and was carried away by the angels into Abraham’s
embrace. The rich man also died and was buried. </p>

<p>“In his torment in Hades he looked up and saw Abraham a long way off with Lazarus in his embrace. So he cried out, ‘Father Abraham, pity me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in agony in these flames’. Abraham said, ‘My son, remember that during your life you had your fill of good things, just as Lazarus his fill of bad. Now he is being comforted here while you are in agony. But that is not all: between us and you a great gulf has been fixed, to prevent those who want to
cross from our side to yours or from your side to ours’. </p>

<p>“So he said, ‘Father, I beg you then to send Lazarus to my father’s house, since I have five brothers, to give them warning so that they do not come to this place of torment too’. Abraham said, ‘They have Moses and the prophets, let them listen to them’. The rich man replied, ‘Ah no, father Abraham, but if someone comes to them from the dead, they will repent’. Then Abraham said to him, ‘If they will not listen either to Moses or to the prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone should rise from the dead’”. </p>

<h4>On leading others astray (17:1–3a)</h4>

<p>He said to his disciples, “Causes of falling are sure to come, but alas for the one through whom they occur! It would be better for such a person to be thrown into the sea with a millstone around the neck than to be the downfall of a single one of these little ones. Keep watch on yourselves! </p>

<h4>Brotherly correction (17:3b–4)</h4>

<p>“If your brother does something wrong, rebuke him and, if he is sorry,
forgive him. And if he wrongs you seven times a day and seven times comes back to you and says, ‘I am sorry’, you must forgive him”. </p>

<h4>The power of faith (17:5–6)</h4>

<p>The apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith”. </p>

<p>The Lord replied, “If you had faith like a mustard seed you could say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea’, and it would obey you. </p>

<h4>Humble service (17:7–10)</h4>

<p>“Which of you, with a servant ploughing or minding sheep, would say to him when he returned from the fields, ‘Come and have your meal at once’? Would he not be more likely to say, ‘Get my supper ready; fasten your belt and wait on me while I eat and drink. You yourself can eat and drink afterwards’? Must he be grateful to the servant for doing what he was told? So with you: when you have done all you have been told to do, say, ‘We are useless servants: we
have done no more than our duty’”. </p>

<h4>The ten victims of skin disease (17:11–19)</h4>

<p>Now it happened that on the way to Jerusalem he was travelling in the borderlands of Samaria and Galilee. As he entered one of the villages, ten men suffering from a virulent skin-disease came to meet him. They stood some way off and called to him, “Jesus! Master! Take pity on us”. </p>

<p>When he saw them he said, “Go and show yourselves to the priests”. Now as they were going away they were cleansed. Finding himself cured, one of them turned back praising God at the top of his voice and threw himself prostrate at the feet of Jesus and thanked him. The man was a Samaritan. This led Jesus to say, “Were not all ten made clean? The other nine, where are they? It seems that no one has come back to give praise to God, except this foreigner”. And he said to the man, “Stand up and go on your way. Your faith has saved you”. </p>

<h4>The coming of the kingdom of God (17:20–21)</h4>

<p>Asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God was to come, he gave them this answer, “The coming of the kingdom of God does not admit of observation and there will be no one to say, ‘Look, it is here! Look, it is there!’ For look, the kingdom of God is among you”. </p>

<h4>The Day of the Son of man (17:22–37)</h4>

<p>He said to the disciples, “A time will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of man and will not see it. They will say to you, ‘Look, it is there!’, or, ‘Look, it is here!’. Make no move; do not set off in pursuit; for as the lightning flashing from one part of heaven lights up the other, so will be the Son of man when his Day comes. But first he is destined to suffer grievously and be rejected by this generation. </p>

<p>“As it was in Noah’s day, so will it also be in the days of the Son of man. People were eating and drinking, marrying wives and husbands, right up to the day Noah went into the ark, and the Flood came and destroyed them all. It will be the same as it was in Lot’s day: people were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building, but the day Lot left Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and it destroyed them all. It will be the same when the day comes for the Son of man to be revealed. </p>

<p>“When that Day comes, no one on the housetop, with his possessions in the house, must come down to collect them, nor must anyone in the fields turn back. Remember Lot’s wife. Anyone who tries to preserve his life will lose it; and anyone who loses it will keep it safe. I tell you, on that night, when two are in one bed, one will be taken, the other left; when two women are grinding corn together, one will be taken, the other left”. </p>

<p>The disciples spoke up and asked, “Where, Lord?”. </p>

<p>He said, “Where the body is, there too will the vultures gather”. </p>

<h4>The unscrupulous judge and the importunate widow (18:1–8)</h4>

<p>Then he told them a parable about the need to pray continually and never lose heart. “There was a judge in a certain town”, he said, “who had neither fear of God nor respect for anyone. In the same town there was also a widow who kept on coming to him and saying, ‘I want justice from you against my enemy!’. For a long time he refused, but at last he said to himself, ‘Even though I have neither fear of God nor respect for any human person, I must give this widow her just rights since she keeps pestering me, or she will come and slap me in the face’”.  And the Lord said, “You notice what the unjust judge has to say? Now, will not God see justice done to his elect if they keep calling to him day and night even though he still delays to help them? I promise you, he will see justice done to them, and done speedily. But when the Son of man comes, will he find any faith on earth?”. </p>

<h4>The Pharisee and the tax collector (18:9–14)</h4>

<p>He spoke the following parable to some people who prided themselves on being upright and despised everyone else, “Two men went up to the Temple to pray, one a Pharisee, the other a tax collector. The Pharisee stood there and said this prayer to himself, ‘I thank you, God, that I am not grasping, unjust, adulterous like everyone else, and particularly that I am not like this tax collector here. I fast twice a week; I pay tithes on all I get’. The tax collector stood some distance away, not daring even to raise his eyes to heaven; but he beat his breast and said, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner’. This man, I tell you, went home again justified; the other did not. For everyone who raises himself up will be humbled, but anyone who humbles himself will be raised up”. </p>

<h4>Jesus and the children (18:15–17)</h4>

<p>People even brought babies to him, for him to touch them; but when the disciples saw this they scolded them. But Jesus called the children to him and said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not stop them; for it is to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs. In truth I tell you, anyone who does not welcome the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it”. </p>

<h4>The rich aristocrat (18:18–23)</h4>

<p>One of the rulers put this question to him, “Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?”. </p>

<p>Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone. You know the commandments: You shall not commit adultery; You shall not kill; You shall not steal; You shall not give false witness; Honour your father and your mother”. </p>

<p>He replied, “I have kept all these since my earliest days”. </p>

<p>And when Jesus heard this he said, “There is still one thing you lack. Sell everything you own and distribute the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me”. But when he heard this he was overcome with sadness, for he was very rich. </p>

<h4>The danger of riches (18:24–27)</h4>

<p>Jesus looked at him and said, “How hard it is for those who have riches to make their way into the kingdom of God! Yes, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for someone rich to enter the kingdom of God”. </p>

<p>Those who were listening said, “In that case, who can be saved?”. </p>

<p>He replied, “Things that are impossible by human resources, are possible for God”. </p>

<h4>The reward of renunciation (18:28–30)</h4>

<p>But Peter said, “Look, we left all we had to follow you”. </p>

<p>He said to them, “In truth I tell you, there is no one who has left house, wife, brothers, parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of God who will not receive many times as much in this present age and, in the world to come, eternal life”. </p>

<h4>Third prophecy of the passion (18:31–34)</h4>

<p>Then taking the Twelve aside he said to them, “Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written by the prophets about the Son of man is to come true. For he will be handed over to the gentiles and will be mocked, maltreated and spat on, and when they have scourged him they will put him to death; and on the third day he will rise again”. But they could make nothing of this; what he said was quite obscure to them, they did not understand what he was telling them. </p>

<h4>Entering Jericho: the blind man (18:35–43)</h4>

<p>Now it happened that as he drew near to Jericho there was a blind man sitting at the side of the road begging. When he heard the crowd going past he asked what it was all about, and they told him that Jesus the Nazarene was passing by. So he called out, “Jesus, Son of David, have pity on me”. The people in front scolded him and told him to keep quiet, but he only shouted all the louder, “Son of David, have pity on me”. </p>

<p>Jesus stopped and ordered them to bring the man to him, and when he came up, asked him, “What do you want me to do for you?”, </p>

<p>“Sir”, he replied, “let me see again”. </p>

<p>Jesus said to him, “Receive your sight. Your faith has saved you”. And instantly his sight returned and he followed him praising God, and all the people who saw it gave praise to God. </p>

<h4>Zacchaeus (19:1–10)</h4>

<p>He entered Jericho and was going through the town and suddenly a man whose name was Zacchaeus made his appearance; he was one of the senior tax collectors and a wealthy man. He kept trying to see which Jesus was, but he was too short and could not see him for the crowd; so he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to catch a glimpse of Jesus who was to pass that way. When Jesus reached the spot he looked up and spoke to him, “Zacchaeus, come down. Hurry, because I am to stay at your house today”. And he hurried down and welcomed him joyfully. They all complained when they saw what was happening. </p>

<p>“He has gone to stay at a sinner’s house”, they said. </p>

<p>But Zacchaeus stood his ground and said to the Lord, “Look, sir, I am going to give half my property to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody I will pay him back four times the amount”. </p>

<p>And Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, because this man too is a son of Abraham; for the Son of man has come to seek out and save what was lost”. </p>

<h4>Parable of the pounds (19:11–27)</h4>

<p>While the people were listening to this he went on to tell a parable, because he was near Jerusalem and they thought that the kingdom of God was going to show itself then and there. Accordingly he said, “A man of noble birth went to a distant country to be appointed king and then return. He summoned ten of his servants and gave them ten pounds, telling them, ‘Trade with these, until I get back’. But his compatriots detested him and sent a delegation to follow him with this message, ‘We do not want this man to be our king’. </p>

<p>“Now it happened that on his return, having received his appointment as king, he sent for those servants to whom he had given the money, to find out what profit each had made by trading. The first came in, ‘Sir’, he said, ‘your one pound has brought in ten’. He replied, ‘Well done, my good servant! Since you have proved yourself trustworthy in a very small thing, you shall have the government of ten cities’. Then came the second, ‘Sir’, he said, ‘your one pound has made five’. To this one also he said, ‘And you shall be in charge of five cities’. Next came the other, ‘Sir’, he said, ‘here is your pound. I put it away safely wrapped up in a cloth because I was afraid of you; for you are an exacting man: you gather in what you have not laid out and reap what you have not sown’. He said to him, ‘You wicked servant! Out of your own mouth I condemn you. So you knew that I was an exacting man, gathering in what I have not laid out and reaping what I have not sown? Then why did you not put my money in the bank? On my return I could have drawn it out with interest’. And he said to those standing by, ‘Take the pound from him and give it to the man who has ten pounds’. And they said to him, ‘But, sir, he has ten pounds …’. ‘I tell you, to everyone who has will be given more; but anyone who has not will be deprived even of what he has. </p>

<p>‘As for my enemies who did not want me for their king, bring them here and execute them in my presence’”. </p>

<h2 id="v">V: Teaching in Jerusalem (19:28–21:38)</h2>

<h4>The <i>Messiah</i> enters Jerusalem (19:28–38)</h4>

<p>When he had said this he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. Now it happened that when he was near Bethphage and Bethany, close by the Mount of Olives as it is called, he sent two of the disciples, saying, “Go to the village opposite, and as you enter it you will find a tethered colt that no one has ever yet ridden. Untie it and bring it here. If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’, you are to say this, ‘The Master needs it’”. The messengers went off and found everything just as he had told them. </p>

<p>As they were untying the colt, its owners said, “Why are you untying it?”, and they answered, “The Master needs it”. So they took the colt to Jesus and, throwing their cloaks on its back, they lifted Jesus on to it. As he moved off, they spread their cloaks in the road, and now, as he was approaching the downward slope of the Mount of Olives, the whole group of disciples joyfully began to praise God at the top of their voices for all the miracles they had seen. They cried out: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>Blessed is he who is coming</span><br />
<span>as King in the name of the Lord!</span><br />
<span>Peace in heaven</span><br />
<span>and glory in the highest heavens! </span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Jesus defends his disciples for acclaiming him (19:39–40)</h4>

<p>Some Pharisees in the crowd said to him, “Master, reprove your disciples”, but he answered, “I tell you, if these keep silence, the stones will cry out”. </p>

<h4>Lament for Jerusalem (19:41–44)</h4>

<p>As he drew near and came in sight of the city he shed tears over it and said, “If you too had only recognised on this day the way to peace! But in fact it is hidden from your eyes! Yes, a time is coming when your enemies will raise fortifications all around you, when they will encircle you and hem you in on every side; they will dash you and the children inside your walls to the ground; they will leave not one stone standing on another within you, because you did not recognise the moment of your visitation”. </p>

<h4>The expulsion of the dealers from the Temple (19:45–46)</h4>

<p>Then he went into the Temple and began driving out those who were busy trading, saying to them, “According to scripture, <i>my house shall be a house of prayer</i> but you have turned it into <i>a bandits’ den</i>”. </p>

<h4>Jesus teaches in the Temple (19:47–48)</h4>

<p>He taught in the Temple every day. The chief priests and the scribes, in company with the leading citizens, tried to do away with him, but they could not find a way to carry this out because the whole people hung on his words. </p>

<h4>The Jews question the authority of Jesus (20:1–8)</h4>

<p>Now it happened that one day while he was teaching the people in the Temple and proclaiming the good news, the chief priests and the scribes came up, together with the elders, and spoke to him. “Tell us”, they said, “what authority have you for acting like this? Or who gives you this authority?”. </p>

<p>In reply he said to them, “And I will ask you a question, just one. Tell me: John’s baptism: what was its origin, heavenly or human?”. </p>

<p>And they debated this way among themselves, “If we say heavenly, he will retort, ‘Why did you refuse to believe him?’; and if we say human, the whole people will stone us, for they are convinced that John was a prophet”. So their reply was that they did not know where it came from. </p>

<p>And Jesus said to them, “Nor will I tell you my authority for acting like this”. </p>

<h4>Parable of the wicked tenants (20:9–19)</h4>

<p>And he went on to tell the people this parable, “A man planted a vineyard and leased it to tenants, and went abroad for a long while. When the right time came, he sent a servant to the tenants to get his share of the produce of the vineyard. But the tenants thrashed him, and sent him away empty-handed. But he went on to send a second servant; they thrashed him too and treated him shamefully and sent him away empty-handed. He still went on to send a third; they wounded this one too, and threw him out. Then the owner of the vineyard thought, ‘What am I to do? I will send them my own beloved son. Perhaps they will respect him’. But when the tenants saw him they put their heads together saying, ‘This is the heir, let us kill him so that the inheritance will be ours’. So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. </p>

<p>“Now what will the owner of the vineyard do to them? He will come and make an end of these tenants and give the vineyard to others”. </p>

<p>Hearing this they said, “God forbid!”. </p>

<p>But he looked hard at them and said, “Then what does this text in the scriptures mean: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>The stone which the builders rejected</span><br />
<span>has become the cornerstone? </span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Anyone who falls on that stone will be dashed to pieces; anyone it falls on will be crushed”. </p>

<p>And the scribes and the chief priests would have liked to lay hands on him that very moment, because they realised that this parable was aimed at them, but they were afraid of the people. </p>

<h4>On tribute to Caesar (20:20–26)</h4>

<p>So they awaited their opportunity and sent agents to pose as upright men, and to catch him out in something he might say and so enable them to hand him over to the jurisdiction and authority of the governor. They put to him this question, “Master, we know that you say and teach what is right; you favour no one, but teach the way of God in all honesty. Is it permissible for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”. </p>

<p>But he was aware of their cunning and said, “Show me a denarius. Whose portrait and title are on it?”. </p>

<p>They said, “Caesar’s”. </p>

<p>He said to them, “Well then, pay Caesar what belongs to Caesar — and God what belongs to God”. </p>

<p>They were unable to catch him out in anything he had to say in public; they were amazed at his answer and were silenced. </p>

<h4>The resurrection of the dead (20:27–40)</h4>

<p>Some Sadducees — those who argue that there is no resurrection — approached him and they put this question to him, “Master, Moses prescribed for us, if a man’s married brother dies childless, the man must marry the widow to raise up children for his brother. Well then, there were seven brothers; the first, having married a wife, died childless. The second and then the third married the widow. And the same with all seven, they died leaving no children. Finally the woman herself died. Now, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be, since she had been married to all seven?”. </p>

<p>Jesus replied, “The children of this world take wives and husbands, but those who are judged worthy of a place in the other world and in the resurrection from the dead do not marry because they can no longer die, for they are the same as the angels, and being children of the resurrection they are children of God. And Moses himself implies that the dead rise again, in the passage about the bush where he calls the Lord the <i>God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob</i>. Now he is God, not of the dead, but of the living; for to him everyone is alive”. </p>

<p>Some scribes then spoke up. They said, “Well put, Master”. They did not dare to ask him any more questions. </p>

<h4>Christ not only son but also Lord of David (20:41–44)</h4>

<p>He then said to them, “How can people maintain that the Christ is son of David? Why, David himself says in the Book of Psalms: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>The Lord declared to my Lord,</span><br />
<span>take your seat at my right hand,</span><br />
<span>until I have made your enemies</span><br />
<span>your footstool. </span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“David here calls him Lord; how then can he be his son?”. </p>

<h4>The scribes condemned by Jesus (20:45–47)</h4>

<p>While all the people were listening he said to the disciples, “Beware of the scribes who like to walk about in long robes and love to be greeted respectfully in the market squares, to take the front seats in the synagogues and the places of honour at banquets, who devour the property of widows, and for show offer long prayers. The more severe will be the sentence they receive”. </p>

<h4>The widow’s mite (21:1–4)</h4>

<p>Looking up, he saw rich people putting their offerings into the treasury; and he noticed a poverty-stricken widow putting in two small coins, and he said, “I tell you truly, this poor widow has put in more than any of them; for these have all put in money they could spare, but she in her poverty has put in all she had to live on”. </p>

<h4>Discourse on the destruction of Jerusalem: Introduction (21:5–7)</h4>

<p>When some were talking about the Temple, remarking how it was adorned with fine stonework and votive offerings, he said, “All these things you are staring at now — the time will come when not a single stone will be left on another; everything will be destroyed”. </p>

<p>And they put to him this question, “Master”, they said, “when will this happen, then, and what sign will there be that it is about to take place?”. </p>

<h4>The warning signs (21:8–19)</h4>

<p>But he said, “Take care not to be deceived, because many will come using my name and saying, ‘I am the one’, and, ‘The time is near at hand’. Refuse to join them. And when you hear of wars and revolutions, do not be terrified, for this is something that must happen first, but the end will not come at once”. Then he said to them, “Nation will fight against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be great earthquakes and plagues and famines in various places; there will be terrifying events and great signs from heaven. </p>

<p>“But before all this happens, you will be seized and persecuted; you will be handed over to the synagogues and to imprisonment, and brought before kings and governors for the sake of my name  — and that will be your opportunity to bear witness. Make up your minds not to prepare your defence, because I myself shall give you an eloquence and a wisdom that none of your opponents will be able to resist or contradict. You will be betrayed even by parents and brothers, relations and friends; and some of you will be put to death. You will be hated universally on account of my name, but not a hair of your head will be lost. Your perseverance will win you your lives. </p>

<h4>The siege (21:20–23)</h4>

<p>“When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then you must realise that it will soon be laid desolate. Then those in Judaea must escape to the mountains, those inside the city must leave it, and those in country districts must not take refuge in it. For this is the time of retribution when all that scripture says must be fulfilled. Alas for those with child, or with babies at the breast, when those days come! </p>

<h4>The disaster and the age of the gentiles (21:24)</h4>

<p>“For great misery will descend on the land and retribution on this people. They will fall by the edge of the sword and be led captive to every gentile country; and Jerusalem will be trampled down by the gentiles until their time is complete. </p>

<h4>Cosmic disasters and the glorious appearing of the Son of man (21:25–28)</h4>

<p>“There will be signs in the sun and moon and stars; on earth nations in agony, bewildered by the turmoil of the ocean and its waves; men fainting away with terror and fear at what menaces the world, for the powers of heaven will be shaken. And then they will see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory. When these things begin to take place, stand erect, hold your heads high, because your liberation is near at hand”. </p>

<h4>The time of this coming (21:29–33)</h4>

<p>And he told them a parable, “Look at the fig tree and indeed every tree. As soon as you see them bud, you can see for yourselves that summer is now near. So with you when you see these things happening: know that the kingdom of God is near. In truth I tell you, before this generation has passed away all will have taken place. Sky and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away. </p>

<h4>Be on the alert (21:34–36)</h4>

<p>“Watch yourselves, or your hearts will be coarsened by debauchery and drunkenness and the cares of life, and that day will come upon you unexpectedly, like a trap. For it will come down on all those living on the face of the earth. Stay awake, praying at all times for the strength to survive all that is going to happen, and to hold your ground before the Son of man”. </p>

<h4>The last days of Jesus (21:37–38)</h4>

<p>All day long he would be in the Temple teaching, but would spend the night in the open on the hill called the Mount of Olives. And from early morning the people thronged to him in the Temple to listen to him. </p>

<h2 id="vi">VI: The Passion (22:1–23:56)</h2>

<h4>The conspiracy against Jesus: Judas betrays him (22:1–6)</h4>

<p>The feast of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover, was now drawing near, and the chief priests and the scribes were looking for some way of doing away with him, because they were afraid of the people. </p>

<p>Then Satan entered into Judas, surnamed Iscariot, who was one of the Twelve. He approached the chief priests and the officers of the guard to discuss some way of handing Jesus over to them. They were delighted and agreed to give him money. He accepted and began to look for an opportunity to betray him to them without people knowing about it. </p>

<h4>Preparation for the Passover supper (22:7–13)</h4>

<p>The day of Unleavened Bread came around, on which the Passover had to be sacrificed, and he sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and make the preparations for us to eat the Passover”. </p>

<p>They asked him, “Where do you want us to prepare it?”. </p>

<p>He said to them, “Look, as you go into the city you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him into the house he enters and tell the owner of the house, ‘The Master says this to you: Where is the room for me to eat the Passover with my disciples?’. The man will show you a large upper room furnished with couches. Make the preparations there”. They set off and found everything as he had told them and prepared the Passover. </p>

<h4>The supper (22:14–18)</h4>

<p>When the time came he took his place at table, and the apostles with him. And he said to them, “I have ardently longed to eat this Passover with you before I suffer; because, I tell you, I shall not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God”. </p>

<p>Then, taking a cup, he gave thanks and said, “Take this and share it among you, because from now on, I tell you, I shall never again drink wine until the kingdom of God comes”. </p>

<h4>The institution of the Eucharist (22:19–20)</h4>

<p>Then he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body given for you; do this in remembrance of me”. He did the same with the cup after supper, and said, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood poured out for you. </p>

<h4>The treachery of Judas foretold (22:21–23)</h4>

<p>“But look, here with me on the table is the hand of the man who is betraying me. The Son of man is indeed on the path which was decreed, but alas for that man by whom he is betrayed!”. And they began to ask one another which of them it could be who was to do this. </p>

<h4>Who is the greatest? (22:24–27)</h4>

<p>An argument also began between them about who should be reckoned the greatest; but he said to them, “Among the gentiles it is the kings who lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are given the title Benefactor. With you this must not happen. No; the greatest among you must behave as if he were the youngest, the leader as if he were the one who serves. For who is the greater: the one at table or the one who serves? The one at table, surely? Yet here am I among you as one who serves! </p>

<h4>The reward promised to the apostles (22:28–30)</h4>

<p>“You are the men who have stood by me faithfully in my trials; and now I confer a kingdom on you, just as my Father conferred one on me: you will eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and you will sit on thrones to judge the twelve tribes of Israel. </p>

<h4>Peter’s denial and repentance foretold (22:31–34)</h4>

<p>“Simon, Simon! Look, Satan has got his wish to sift you all like wheat; but I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail, and once you have recovered, you in your turn must strengthen your brothers”. </p>

<p>“Lord”, he answered, “I would be ready to go to prison with you, and to death”. </p>

<p>Jesus replied, “I tell you, Peter, by the time the cock crows today you will have denied three times that you know me”. </p>

<h4>A time of crisis (22:35–38)</h4>

<p>He said to them, “When I sent you out without purse or haversack or sandals, were you short of anything?”. </p>

<p>“No, nothing”, they said. </p>

<p>He said to them, “But now if you have a purse, take it, and the same with a
haversack; if you have no sword, sell your cloak and buy one, because I tell you these words of scripture are destined to be fulfilled in me: <i>He was counted as one of the rebellious</i>. Yes, what it says about me is even now reaching its fulfilment”. </p>

<p>They said, “Lord, here are two swords”. </p>

<p>He said to them, “That is enough!”. </p>

<h4>The mount of Olives (22:39–46)</h4>

<p>He then left to make his way as usual to the Mount of Olives, with the disciples following. When he reached the place he said to them, “Pray not to be put to the test”. </p>

<p>Then he withdrew from them, about a stone’s throw away, and knelt down and prayed. “Father”, he said, “if you are willing, take this cup away from me. Nevertheless, let your will be done, not mine”. Then an angel appeared to him, coming from heaven to give him strength. In his anguish he prayed even more earnestly, and his sweat fell to the ground like great drops of blood. </p>

<p>When he rose from prayer he went to the disciples and found them sleeping for sheer grief. And he said to them, “Why are you asleep? Get up and pray not to be put to the test”. </p>

<h4>The arrest (22:47–53)</h4>

<p>Suddenly, while he was still speaking, a number of men appeared, and at the head of them the man called Judas, one of the Twelve, who went up to Jesus to kiss him.  Jesus said, “Judas, are you betraying the Son of man with a kiss?”. </p>

<p>His followers, seeing what was about to happen, said, “Lord, shall we use our swords?”. And one of them struck the high priest’s servant and cut off his right ear. </p>

<p>But at this Jesus said, “That is enough”. And touching the man’s ear he healed him. </p>

<p>Then Jesus said to the chief priests and captains of the Temple guard and elders who had come for him, “Am I a bandit, that you had to set out with swords and clubs? When I was among you in the Temple day after day you never made a move to lay hands on me. But this is your hour; this is the reign of darkness”. </p>

<h4>Peter’s denials (22:54–62)</h4>

<p>They seized him then and led him away, and they took him to the high priest’s house. Peter followed at a distance. They had lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and Peter sat down among them, and as he was sitting there by the blaze a servant-girl saw him, peered at him, and said, “This man
was with him too”. But he denied it. </p>

<p>“Woman, I do not know him”, he said. </p>

<p>Shortly afterwards someone else saw him and said, “You are one of them too”. </p>

<p>But Peter replied, “I am not, my friend”. </p>

<p>About an hour later another man insisted, saying, “This fellow was certainly with him. Why, he is a Galilean”. </p>

<p>Peter said, “My friend, I do not know what you are talking about”. </p>

<p>At that instant, while he was still speaking, the cock crowed, and the Lord turned and looked straight at Peter, and Peter remembered the Lord’s words when he had said to him, “Before the cock crows today, you will have disowned me three times”. And he went outside and wept bitterly. </p>

<h4>Jesus mocked by the guards (22:63–65)</h4>

<p>Meanwhile the men who guarded Jesus were mocking and beating him. They blindfolded him and questioned him, saying, “Prophesy! Who hit you then?”. And they heaped many other insults on him. </p>

<h4>Jesus before the Sanhedrin (22:66–23:1)</h4>

<p>When day broke there was a meeting of the elders of the people, the chief priests and scribes. He was brought before their council, and they said to him, “If you are the Christ, tell us”. </p>

<p>He replied, “If I tell you, you will not believe, and if I question you, you will not answer. But from now on, the Son of man will be seated at the right hand of the Power of God”. </p>

<p>They all said, “So you are the Son of God then?”. </p>

<p>He answered, “It is you who say I am”. </p>

<p>Then they said, “Why do we need any evidence? We have heard it for ourselves from his own lips”. </p>

<p>The whole assembly then rose, and they brought him before Pilate. </p>

<h4>Jesus before Pilate (23:2–7)</h4>

<p>They began their accusation by saying, “We found this man inciting our people to revolt, opposing payment of the tribute to Caesar, and claiming to be Christ, a king”. </p>

<p>Pilate put to him this question, “Are you the king of the Jews?”. </p>

<p>He replied, “It is you who say it”. </p>

<p>Pilate then said to the chief priests and the crowd, “I find no case against this man”. </p>

<p>But they persisted, “He is inflaming the people with his teaching all over Judaea and all the way from Galilee, where he started, down to here”. When Pilate heard this, he asked if the man were a Galilean; and finding that he came under Herod’s jurisdiction, he passed him over to Herod, who was also in
Jerusalem at that time. </p>

<h4>Jesus before Herod (23:8–12)</h4>

<p>Herod was delighted to see Jesus; he had heard about him and had been wanting for a long time to set eyes on him; moreöver, he was hoping to see some miracle worked by him. So he questioned him at some length, but without getting any reply. Meanwhile the chief priests and the scribes were there, vigorously pressing their accusations. Then Herod, together with his guards, treated him with contempt and made fun of him; he put a rich cloak on him and sent him back to Pilate. And though Herod and Pilate had been enemies before, they were reconciled that same day. </p>

<h4>Jesus before Pilate again (23:13–25)</h4>

<p>Pilate then summoned the chief priests and the leading men and the people. He said to them, “You brought this man before me as a popular agitator. Now I have gone into the matter myself in your presence and found no grounds in the man for any of the charges you bring against him. Nor has Herod either, since he has sent him back to us. As you can see, the man has done nothing that deserves death, so I shall have him flogged and then let him go”. </p>

<p>But as one man they howled, “Away with him! Give us Barabbas!”. This man had been thrown into prison because of a riot in the city and murder. </p>

<p>In his desire to set Jesus free, Pilate addressed them again, but they shouted back, “Crucify him! Crucify him!”. </p>

<p>And for the third time he spoke to them, “But what harm has this man done? I have found no case against him that deserves death, so I shall have him flogged and then let him go”. But they kept on shouting at the top of their voices, demanding that he should be crucified. And their shouts kept growing louder. </p>

<p>Pilate then gave his verdict: their demand was to be granted. He released the man they asked for, who had been imprisoned because of rioting and murder, and handed Jesus over to them to deal with as they pleased. </p>

<h4>The way to Calvary (23:26–32)</h4>

<p>As they were leading him away they seized on a man, Simon from Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, and made him shoulder the cross and carry it behind Jesus. Large numbers of people followed him, and women too, who mourned and lamented for him. But Jesus turned to them and said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep rather for yourselves and for your children. For look, the days are surely coming when people will say, ‘Blessed are those who are barren, the wombs that have never borne children, the breasts that have never suckled!’. Then they will begin to <i>say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’; to the hills, ‘Cover us!’</i>. For if this is what is done to green wood, what will be done when the wood is dry?”. Now they were also leading out two others, criminals, to be executed with him. </p>

<h4>The crucifixion (23:33–34)</h4>

<p>When they reached the place called The Skull, there they crucified him and the two criminals, one on his right, the other on his left. Jesus said, “Father, forgive them; they do not know what they are doing”. Then they cast lots to share out his clothing. </p>

<h4>The crucified Christ is mocked (23:35–38)</h4>

<p>The people stayed there watching. As for the leaders, they jeered at him with the words, “He saved others, let him save himself if he is the Christ of God, the Chosen One”. </p>

<p>The soldiers mocked him too, coming up to him, offering him vinegar, and saying, “If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself”. </p>

<p>Above him there was an inscription: “This is the King of the Jews”. </p>

<h4>The good thief (23:39–43)</h4>

<p>One of the criminals hanging there abused him: “Are you not the Christ? Save yourself and us as well”. </p>

<p>But the other spoke up and rebuked him. “Have you no fear of God at all?”. he said. “You got the same sentence as he did, but in our case we deserved it: we are paying for what we did. But this man has done nothing wrong”. Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom”. </p>

<p>He answered him, “In truth I tell you, today you will be with me in paradise”. </p>

<h4>The death of Jesus (23:44–46)</h4>

<p>It was now about the sixth hour and the sun’s light failed, so that darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour. The veil of the Sanctuary was torn right down the middle. Jesus cried out in a loud voice saying, “Father, into your hands I commit my spirit”. With these words
he breathed his last. </p>

<h4>After the death (23:47–49)</h4>

<p>When the centurion saw what had taken place, he gave praise to God and said, “Truly, this was an upright man”. And when all the crowds who had gathered for the spectacle saw what had happened, they went home beating their breasts. </p>

<p>All his friends stood at a distance; so also did the women who had accompanied him from Galilee and saw all this happen. </p>

<h4>The burial (23:50–56)</h4>

<p>And now a member of the Council arrived, a good and upright man named Joseph. He had not consented to what the others had planned and carried out. He came from Arimathaea, a Jewish town, and he lived in the hope of seeing the kingdom of God. This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. He then took it down, wrapped it in a shroud and put it in a tomb which was hewn in stone and which had never held a body. It was Preparation day and the Sabbath was beginning to grow light. Meanwhile the women who had come from Galilee with Jesus were following behind. They took note of the tomb and how the body had been laid. Then they returned and prepared spices and ointments. And on the Sabbath day they rested, as the Law required. </p>

<h2 id="vii">VII: After the resurrection (24:1–24:53)</h2>

<h4>The empty tomb. The angel’s message (24:1–8)</h4>

<p>On the first day of the week, at the first sign of dawn, they went to the tomb with the spices they had prepared. They found that the stone had been rolled away from the tomb, but on entering they could not find the body of the Lord Jesus. As they stood there puzzled about this, two men in brilliant clothes suddenly appeared at their side. Terrified, the women bowed their heads to the ground. But the two said to them, “Why look among the dead for someone who is alive? He is not here; he has risen. Remember what he told you when he was still in Galilee: that the Son of man was destined to be handed over into the power of sinful men and be crucified, and rise again on the third day”. And they remembered his words. </p>

<h4>The apostles refuse to believe the women (24:9–11)</h4>

<p>And they returned from the tomb and told all this to the Eleven and to all the others. The women were Mary of Magdala, Joanna, and Mary the mother of James. And the other women with them also told the apostles, but this story of theirs seemed pure nonsense, and they did not believe them. </p>

<h4>Peter at the tomb (24:12)</h4>

<p>Peter, however, went off to the tomb, running. He bent down and looked in and saw the linen cloths but nothing else; he then went back home, amazed at what had happened. </p>

<h4>The road to Emmaus (24:13–35)</h4>

<p>Now that very same day, two of them were on their way to a village called Emmaus, seven miles from Jerusalem, and they were talking together about all that had happened. And it happened that as they were talking together and discussing it, Jesus himself came up and walked by their side; but their eyes were prevented from recognising him. He said to them, “What are all these things that you are discussing as you walk along?”. They stopped, their faces downcast. </p>

<p>Then one of them, called Cleopas, answered him, “You must be the only person staying in Jerusalem who does not know the things that have been happening there these last few days”. </p>

<p>He asked, “What things?”. </p>

<p>They answered, “All about Jesus of Nazareth, who showed himself a prophet powerful in action and speech before God and the whole people; and how our chief priests and our leaders handed him over to be sentenced to death, and had him crucified. Our own hope had been that he would be the one to set Israel free. And this is not all: two whole days have now gone by since it all happened; and some women from our group have astounded us: they went to the tomb in the early morning, and when they could not find the body, they came back to tell us they had seen a vision of angels who declared he was alive. Some of our friends went to the tomb and found everything exactly as the women had reported, but of him they saw nothing”. </p>

<p>Then he said to them, “You foolish men! So slow to believe all that the prophets have said! Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer before entering into his glory?”. Then, starting with Moses and going through all the prophets, he explained to them the passages throughout the scriptures that were about himself. </p>

<p>When they drew near to the village to which they were going, he made as if to go on; but they pressed him to stay with them saying, “It is nearly evening, and the day is almost over”. So he went in to stay with them. Now while he was with them at table, he took the bread and said the blessing; then he broke it and handed it to them. And their eyes were opened and they recognised him; but he had vanished from their sight. Then they said to each other, “Did not our hearts burn within us as he talked to us on the road and
explained the scriptures to us?”. </p>

<p>They set out that instant and returned to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven assembled together with their companions, who said to them, “The Lord has indeed risen and has appeared to Simon”. Then they told their story of what had happened on the road and how they had recognised him at the breaking of bread. </p>

<h4>Jesus appears to the apostles (24:36–43)</h4>

<p>They were still talking about all this when he himself stood among them and said to them, “Peace be with you!”. In a state of alarm and fright, they thought they were seeing a ghost. But he said, “Why are you so agitated, and why are these doubts stirring in your hearts? See by my hands and my feet that it is I myself. Touch me and see for yourselves; a ghost has no flesh and bones as you can see I have”. And as he said this he showed them his hands and his feet. Their joy was so great that they still could not believe it, as they were dumbfounded; so he said to them, “Have you anything here to eat?”. And they offered him a piece of grilled fish, which he took and ate before their eyes. </p>

<h4>Last instructions to the apostles (24:36–43)</h4>
