<h3 id="ia">A: Prophecies Before the Syro-Ephraimite War (1:1–5:30)</h3>

<h4>Title (1:1)</h4>

<p>The vision of Isaiah son of Amoz concerning Judah and Jerusalem, which he received in the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah kings of Judah.</p>

<h4>Against an ungrateful people (1:2–9)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Listen, you heavens; earth, attend, for Yahweh is speaking,</span><br />
		<span>“I have reared children and brought them up,</span><br />
		<span>but they have rebelled against me.</span><br />
		<span>The ox knows its owner and the donkey its master’s crib; </span><br />
		<span>Israel does not know, my people do not understand”.</span><br />
		<span>Disaster, sinful nation, people weighed down with guilt, </span><br />
		<span>race of wrong-doers, perverted children! </span><br />
		<span>They have abandoned Yahweh, despised the Holy One of Israel, </span><br />
		<span>they have turned away from him.</span><br />
		<span>Where shall I strike you next, if you persist in treason?</span><br />
		<span>The whole head is sick, the whole heart is diseased,</span><br />
		<span>from the sole of the foot to the head there is nothing healthy:</span><br />
		<span>only wounds, bruises and open sores </span><br />
		<span>not dressed, not bandaged, not soothed with ointment,</span><br />
		<span>your country a desolation, your towns burnt down, </span><br />
		<span>your soil, foreigners lay it waste before your eyes, </span><br />
		<span>a desolation like devastation by foreigners. </span><br />
		<span>The daughter of Zion is left like a shanty in a vineyard, </span><br />
		<span>like a shed in a cucumber field, like a city besieged.</span><br />
		<span>Had Yahweh Sabaoth not left us a few survivors, </span><br />
		<span>we should be like Sodom, we should be the same as Gomorrah.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Against hypocrisy (1:10–20)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Hear what Yahweh says, you rulers of Sodom;</span><br />
		<span>listen to what our God teaches, you people of Gomorrah.</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>“What are your endless sacrifices to me?”, says Yahweh. </span><br />
		<span>“I am sick of burnt offerings of rams </span><br />
		<span>and the fat of calves. </span><br />
		<span>I take no pleasure in the blood </span><br />
		<span>of bulls and lambs and goats.</span><br />
		<span>When you come and present yourselves before me,</span><br />
		<span>who has asked you to trample through my courts?</span><br />
		<span>Bring no more futile cereal offerings, </span><br />
		<span>the smoke from them fills me with disgust. </span><br />
		<span>New Moons, Sabbaths, assemblies — I cannot endure solemnity </span><br />
		<span>combined with guilt.</span><br />
		<span>Your New Moons and your meetings I utterly detest; </span><br />
		<span>to me they are a burden I am tired of bearing.</span><br />
		<span>When you stretch out your hands I turn my eyes away. </span><br />
		<span>You may multiply your prayers, I shall not be listening. </span><br />
		<span>Your hands are covered in blood,</span><br />
		<span>wash, make yourselves clean. </span><br />
		<span>Take your wrong-doing out of my sight. </span><br />
		<span>Cease doing evil. Learn to do good, </span><br />
		<span>search for justice, discipline the violent, </span><br />
		<span>be just to the orphan, plead for the widow.</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>“Come, let us talk this over”, says Yahweh. </span><br />
		<span>“Though your sins are like scarlet, </span><br />
		<span>they shall be white as snow; </span><br />
		<span>though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool.</span><br />
		<span>If you are willing to obey, you shall eat the good things of the earth.</span><br />
		<span>But if you refuse and rebel, the sword shall eat you instead —</span><br />
		<span>for Yahweh’s mouth has spoken”.</span>

<h4>Lament for Jerusalem (1:21–28)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>The faithful city,</span><br />
		<span>what a harlot she has become!</span><br />
		<span>Zion, once full of fair judgement,</span><br />
		<span>where saving justice used to dwell,</span><br />
		<span>but now assassins!</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Your silver has turned into dross, </span><br />
		<span>your wine is watered.</span><br />
		<span>Your princes are rebels,</span><br />
		<span>accomplices of brigands.</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>All of them greedy for presents</span><br />
		<span>and eager for bribes,</span><br />
		<span>they show no justice to the orphan,</span><br />
		<span>and the widow’s cause never reaches them.</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Hence, the Lord Yahweh Sabaoth, </span><br />
		<span>the Mighty One of Israel, says this, </span><br />
		<span>“Disaster, I shall get the better of my enemies, </span><br />
		<span>I shall avenge myself on my foes.</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>“I shall turn my hand against you,</span><br />
		<span>I shall purge your dross as though with potash, </span><br />
		<span>I shall remove all your alloy.</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>“And I shall restore your judges as at first, </span><br />
		<span>your counsellors as in bygone days, </span><br />
		<span>after which you will be called City of Saving Justice, </span><br />
		<span>Faithful City”.</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Zion will be redeemed by fair judgement, </span><br />
		<span>and those who return, by saving justice.</span><br />
		<span>Rebels and sinners alike will be destroyed, </span><br />
		<span>and those who abandon Yahweh will perish.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Against sacred trees (1:29–31)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>How ashamed you will be of the terebinths </span><br />
		<span>which gave you such delight; </span><br />
		<span>and how you will blush for the gardens which you chose!</span><br />
		<span>For you will be like a terebinth with faded leaves, </span><br />
		<span>like a garden without water;</span><br />
		<span>the strong will become like tinder, his work like the spark; </span><br />
		<span>both will go up in flames together, </span><br />
		<span>with no one to put them out.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Everlasting peace (2:1–5)</h4>

<p>The vision of Isaiah son of Amoz, concerning Judah and Jerusalem.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>It will happen in the final days </span><br />
		<span>that the mountain of Yahweh’s house </span><br />
		<span>will rise higher than the mountains</span><br />
		<span>and tower above the heights. </span><br />
		<span>Then all the nations will stream to it, </span><br />
		<span>many peoples will come to it and say, </span><br />
		<span>“Come, let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh, </span><br />
		<span>to the house of the God of Jacob </span><br />
		<span>that he may teach us his ways </span><br />
		<span>so that we may walk in his paths”. </span><br />
		<span>For the Law will issue from Zion </span><br />
		<span>and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem.</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Then he will judge between the nations </span><br />
		<span>and arbitrate between many peoples. </span><br />
		<span>They will hammer their swords into ploughshares </span><br />
		<span>and their spears into sickles. </span><br />
		<span>Nation will not lift sword against nation, </span><br />
		<span>no longer will they learn how to make war.</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>House of Jacob, come, let us walk in Yahweh’s light.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>The brilliance of Yahweh’s majesty (2:6–17)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>You have rejected your people, the House of Jacob, </span><br />
		<span>for it has long been full of sorcerers </span><br />
		<span>like the Philistines, </span><br />
		<span>and is overrun with foreigners.</span><br />
		<span>The country is full of silver and gold and treasures unlimited, </span><br />
		<span>the country is full of horses, its chariots are unlimited;</span><br />
		<span>the country is full of idols. </span><br />
		<span>They bow down before the work of their hands, </span><br />
		<span>before what their own fingers have made.</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Human nature has been humbled, humankind brought low: </span><br />
		<span>do not raise them again!</span><br />
		<span>Go into the rock, hide in the dust, </span><br />

		<span>when he arises to make the earth quake.</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Human pride will lower its eyes, </span><br />
		<span>human arrogance will be humbled, </span><br />
		<span>and Yahweh alone will be exalted, on that day.</span><br />
		<span>That will be a day for Yahweh Sabaoth, </span><br />
		<span>for all who are majestic and haughty, </span><br />
		<span>for all who are proud, to be brought low,</span><br />
		<span>for all the cedars of Lebanon, high and proud, </span><br />
		<span>and for all the oaks of Bashan;</span><br />
		<span>for all the high mountains </span><br />
		<span>and for all the proud hills;</span><br />
		<span>for every lofty tower </span><br />
		<span>and for every towering wall;</span><br />
		<span>for all the ships of Tarshish </span><br />
		<span>and for everything held precious.</span>

	<p class="poem">
		<span>Human pride will be humbled, </span><br />

	<p class="poem">
		<span>When the idols all disappear,</span><br />

		<span>in terror of Yahweh, at the brilliance of his majesty, </span><br />
		<span>when he arises to make the earth quake.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That day, people will fling to moles and bats the silver idols and golden idols which have been made for them to worship,</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>and go into the crevices of the rocks </span><br />
		<span>and the clefts in the cliffs, </span><br />

<h4>Anarchy in Jerusalem (3:1–15)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Now the Lord Yahweh Sabaoth </span><br />
		<span>is about to deprive Jerusalem and Judah </span><br />
		<span>of resources and provisions —</span><br />
		<span>all reserves of food, all reserves of water —</span><br />
		<span>of hero, warrior, judge, prophet, </span><br />
		<span>diviner, elder, captain, dignitary, </span><br />
		<span>counsellor, architect, soothsayer.</span><br />
		<span>“I shall give them boys for princes, </span><br />
		<span>raw lads to rule over them”.</span><br />
		<span>People will be ill-treated by one another, </span><br />
		<span>each by his neighbour; </span><br />
		<span>the young will insult the aged, </span><br />
		<span>and the low, the respected.</span><br />
		<span>Yes, a man will catch hold of his brother </span><br />
		<span>in their father’s house, to say, </span><br />
		<span>“You have a cloak, so you be leader, </span><br />
		<span>and rule this heap of ruins”.</span><br />
		<span>And, that day, the other will protest, </span><br />
		<span>“I am no healer; </span><br />
		<span>in my house there is neither food nor clothing; </span><br />
		<span>do not make me leader of the people”.</span><br />
		<span>For Jerusalem has collapsed </span><br />
		<span>and Judah has fallen, </span><br />
		<span>because their words and deeds affront Yahweh </span><br />
		<span>and insult his glorious gaze.</span><br />
		<span>Their complacency bears witness against them, </span><br />
		<span>they parade their sin like Sodom; </span><br />
		<span>they do not conceal it, all the worse for them, </span><br />
		<span>for they have hatched their own downfall.</span><br />
		<span>Say, “Blessed the upright, </span><br />
		<span>for he will feed on the fruit of his deeds;</span><br />
		<span>woe to the wicked, it will go ill with him, </span><br />
		<span>for he will be treated as his actions deserve”.</span><br />
		<span>O my people, their oppressors pillage them </span><br />
		<span>and extortioners rule over them! </span><br />
		<span>O my people, your rulers mislead you </span><br />
		<span>and efface the paths you ought to follow!</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh has risen to accuse, </span><br />
		<span>is standing to pass judgement on the people.</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh is about to try </span><br />
		<span>the elders and the princes of his people, </span><br />
		<span>“You are the ones who have ravaged the vineyard, </span><br />
		<span>the spoils of the poor are in your houses.</span><br />
		<span>By what right do you crush my people </span><br />
		<span>and grind the faces of the poor?”, </span><br />
		<span>says the Lord Yahweh Sabaoth.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>The women of Jerusalem (3:16–24)</h4>

<p>Yahweh says:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Because Zion’s daughters are proud </span><br />
		<span>and walk with heads held high </span><br />
		<span>and enticing eyes — with mincing steps they go, </span><br />
		<span>jingling the bangles on their feet —</span><br />
		<span>the Lord will give Zion’s daughters scabby heads, </span><br />
		<span>Yahweh will lay their foreheads bare.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That day the Lord will take away the ornamental chains, medallions, crescents, pendants, bracelets, trinkets, diadems, ankle-chains, necklaces, scent bottles, amulets, finger-rings, nose-rings, party dresses, cloaks, scarves, purses, mirrors, linen clothes, turbans and mantillas.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Then, instead of perfume, a stink; </span><br />
		<span>instead of belt, a rope, </span><br />
		<span>instead of hair elaborately dressed, a shaven scalp, </span><br />
		<span>instead of gorgeous clothes, sacking round the waist, </span><br />
		<span>and brand marks instead of beauty.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Misery in Jerusalem (3:25–4:1)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Your men will fall by the sword, </span><br />
		<span>your warriors in battle,</span><br />
		<span>and her gates will moan and mourn; </span><br />
		<span>she will sit on the ground, deserted.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p >That day, seven women will catch hold of one man and say, “We will eat our own food, and wear our own clothing, but just let us bear your name. Take our disgrace away”.</p>

<h4>Yahweh’s seedling (4:2–6)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>That day, Yahweh’s seedling will turn to beauty and glory, </span><br />
		<span>what the earth brings forth will turn to the pride and ornament </span><br />
		<span>of Israel’s survivors.</span><br />
		<span>Those who are left in Zion and remain in Jerusalem </span><br />
		<span>will be called holy, </span><br />
		<span>all those in Jerusalem noted down to live.</span><br />
		<span>When the Lord has washed away </span><br />
		<span>the filth of Zion’s daughters </span><br />
		<span>and with the wind of judgement and the wind of burning cleansed </span><br />
		<span>Jerusalem of the blood shed in her,</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh will create, </span><br />
		<span>over every house on Mount Zion </span><br />
		<span>and over those who assemble there, </span><br />
		<span>a cloud by day, </span><br />
		<span>and by night smoke with the brightness of a flaring fire. </span><br />
		<span>For over all will be the Glory as canopy and tent </span><br />
		<span>to give shade by day from the heat, </span><br />
		<span>refuge and shelter from the storm and the rain.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>The song of the vineyard (5:1–7)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Let me sing my beloved</span><br />
		<span>the song of my friend for his vineyard.</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>My beloved had a vineyard </span><br />
		<span>on a fertile hillside.</span><br />
		<span>He dug it, cleared it of stones, </span><br />
		<span>and planted it with red grapes. </span><br />
		<span>In the middle he built a tower, </span><br />
		<span>he hewed a press there too. </span><br />
		<span>He expected it to yield fine grapes: </span><br />
		<span>wild grapes were all it yielded.</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>And now, citizens of Jerusalem and people of Judah, </span><br />
		<span>I ask you to judge between me and my vineyard.</span><br />
		<span>What more could I have done for my vineyard </span><br />
		<span>that I have not done? </span><br />
		<span>Why, when I expected it to yield fine grapes, </span><br />
		<span>has it yielded wild ones?</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Very well, I shall tell you what I am going to do to my vineyard: </span><br />
		<span>I shall take away its hedge, for it to be grazed on, </span><br />
		<span>and knock down its wall, for it to be trampled on.</span><br />
		<span>I shall let it go to waste, unpruned, undug, </span><br />
		<span>overgrown by brambles and thorn-bushes, </span><br />
		<span>and I shall command the clouds to rain no rain on it.</span><br />
		<span>Now, the vineyard of Yahweh Sabaoth is the House of Israel, </span><br />
		<span>and the people of Judah the plant he cherished. </span><br />
		<span>He expected fair judgement, but found injustice, </span><br />
		<span>uprightness, but found cries of distress.</span>

		<span>Yahweh Sabaoth has sworn this in my hearing, </span><br />
		<span>“Many houses will be brought to ruin, </span><br />
		<span>great and fine ones left untenanted;</span><br />
		<span>for ten acres of vineyard will yield only one barrel, </span><br />

<h3 id="ib">B: The Book of Immanuel (6:1–12:6)</h3>

<h4>The call of Isaiah (6:1–13)</h4>

<p>In the year of King Uzziah’s death I saw the Lord seated on a high and lofty throne; his train filled the sanctuary. Above him stood seraphs, each one with six wings: two to cover its face, two to cover its feet and two for flying; and they were shouting these words to each other:</p> 

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Holy, holy, holy is Yahweh Sabaoth.</span><br />
		<span>His glory fills the whole earth.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The door-posts shook at the sound of their shouting, and the Temple was full of smoke. Then I said:</p> 

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>“Woe is me! I am lost, </span><br />
		<span>for I am a man of unclean lips </span><br />
		<span>and I live among a people of unclean lips, </span><br />
		<span>and my eyes have seen the King, Yahweh Sabaoth”.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then one of the seraphs flew to me, holding in its hand a live coal which it had taken from the altar with a pair of tongs. With this it touched my mouth and said:</p> 

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>“Look, this has touched your lips,</span><br />
		<span>your guilt has been removed</span><br />
		<span>and your sin forgiven”.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I then heard the voice of the Lord saying:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>“Whom shall I send? Who will go for us?”.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote> 

<p>And I said, “Here am I, send me”. He said:</p> 

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>“Go, and say to this people, </span><br />
		<span>‘Listen and listen, but never understand! </span><br />
		<span>Look and look, but never perceive!’.</span><br />
		<span>Make this people’s heart coarse, </span><br />
		<span>make their ears dull, shut their eyes tight, </span><br />
		<span>or they will use their eyes to see, </span><br />
		<span>use their ears to hear, </span><br />
		<span>use their heart to understand, </span><br />
		<span>and change their ways and be healed”.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I then said, “Until when, Lord?”. </p>

<p>He replied, “Until towns are in ruins and deserted, houses untenanted and a great desolation reigns in the land, and Yahweh has driven the people away and the country is totally abandoned. And suppose one-tenth of them are left in it, that will be stripped again, like the terebinth, like the oak, cut back to the stock; their stock is a holy seed”.</p>

<h4>Isaiah intervenes (7:1–9)</h4>

<p>In the reign of Ahaz son of Jotham, son of Uzziah king of Judah, Razon king of Aram advanced on Jerusalem with Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel, to attack it; but he was unable to attack it. The House of David was informed: “Aram has halted in Ephraimite territory”. At this, his heart and his people’s hearts shook like forest trees shaking in the wind.</p>

<p>Yahweh then said to Isaiah, “Go out with your son Shear-Jashub, and meet Ahaz at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, on the road to the Fuller’s Field, and say to him, ‘Pay attention and keep calm. Do not be frightened or demoralised by these two smouldering sticks of firewood, by the fierce anger of Razon, Aram and the son of Remaliah, or because Aram, Ephraim and the son of Remaliah have been plotting against you and saying: Let us mount an attack on Judah, destroy it, force it onto our side and install the son of Tabeel there as king.</p>

<p>‘Lord Yahweh says this:</p> 

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>This will not happen, it will never occur,</span><br />
		<span>for the head of Aram is Damascus, </span><br />
		<span>and the head of Damascus is Razon; </span><br />
		<span>another sixty-five years, and</span><br />
		<span>Ephraim will cease to be a people.</span><br />
		<span>The head of Ephraim is Samaria,</span><br />
		<span>and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah.</span><br />
		<span>If you will not take your stand on me </span><br />
		<span>you will not stand firm’”.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Isaiah intervenes again (7:10–17)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Ahaz again and said:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Ask Yahweh your God for a sign, </span><br />
		<span>either in the depths of Sheol or in the heights above.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But Ahaz said, “I will not ask. I will not put Yahweh to the test”. He then said:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Listen now, House of David: </span><br />
		<span>are you not satisfied with trying human patience </span><br />
		<span>that you should try my God’s patience too?</span><br />
		<span>The Lord will give you a sign in any case: </span><br />
		<span>It is this: the young woman is with child </span><br />
		<span>and will give birth to a son </span><br />
		<span>whom she will call Immanuel.</span><br />
		<span>On curds and honey will he feed </span><br />
		<span>until he knows how to refuse the bad </span><br />
		<span>and choose the good.</span><br />
		<span>Before the child knows how to refuse the bad and choose the good, </span><br />
		<span>the lands whose two kings are frightening you will be deserted.</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh will bring times for you, </span><br />
		<span>your people and your ancestral House, </span><br />
		<span>such as have not been seen </span><br />
		<span>since Ephraim broke away from Judah (the king of Assyria).</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Prediction of an invasion (7:18–25)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>When that day comes, </span><br />
		<span>Yahweh will whistle up mosquitoes </span><br />
		<span>from the distant streams of Egypt </span><br />
		<span>and bees from the land of Assyria,</span><br />
		<span>and they will all come and settle </span><br />
		<span>on the streams in the gullies, in the holes in the rocks, </span><br />
		<span>on all the thorn-bushes and on all the water-points.</span><br />
		<span>That day the Lord will shave, </span><br />
		<span>with a razor hired from the other side of the River </span><br />
		<span>(with the king of Assyria), </span><br />
		<span>the head and the hair of the leg, </span><br />
		<span>and take off the beard, too.</span><br />
		<span>When that day comes, each man will raise </span><br />
		<span>one heifer and two sheep,</span><br />
		<span>and because of the abundant milk they give </span><br />
		<span>(on curds will he feed) </span><br />
		<span>all who are left in the country </span><br />
		<span>will feed on curds and honey.</span><br />
		<span>When that day comes, wherever there used to be a thousand vines </span><br />
		<span>worth a thousand pieces of silver,</span><br />
		<span>all will be brambles and thorn-bushes;</span><br />
		<span>to be ventured into only with arrows and bow, </span><br />
		<span>for the country will be nothing but brambles and thorn-bushes.</span><br />
		<span>No more will you venture </span><br />
		<span>on any hillside formerly under the hoe </span><br />
		<span>for fear of the brambles and thorn-bushes; </span><br />
		<span>it will be fit only for pasturing the cattle, </span><br />
		<span>a tramping-ground for sheep.</span>

<h4>The birth of a son to Isaiah (8:1–4)</h4>

<p>Yahweh said to me, “Take a large tablet and on it with an ordinary stylus write, ‘Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz’. And take reliable witnesses, the priest Uriah and Zechariah son of Jeberechiah”.</p>

<p>I then had intercourse with the prophetess, who then conceived and gave birth to a son. Yahweh said to me, “Call him Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz, for before the child knows how to say ‘mother’ or ‘father’, the wealth of Damascus and the booty of Samaria will be carried away while the king of Assyria looks on”.</p>

<h4>Shiloah and the Euphrates ( 8:5–10)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to me again and said, “Since this people has rejected the waters of Shiloah which flow smoothly, and has trembled before Razon and the son of Remaliah, now, against it, the Lord will bring the mighty, swelling waters of the River (the king of Assyria and all his glory); the River will flood up all its channels and overflow all its banks; it will flow into Judah, flooding everything and passing on; it will reach right up to the neck, and the spreading of its wings will cover the whole extent of your country, Immanuel!</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">

		<span>listen, all members of far-off nations! </span><br />

<h4>Isaiah’s mission (8:11–20)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>For this was how Yahweh spoke to me when his hand seized hold of me </span><br />
		<span>and he taught me not to follow the path of this people, saying,</span><br />
		<span>“Do not call conspiracy all that this people calls conspiracy; </span><br />
		<span>do not dread what they dread, have no fear of that.</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh Sabaoth is the one you will proclaim holy, </span><br />
		<span>him you will dread, him you will fear.</span><br />
		<span>He will be a sanctuary, a stumbling-stone, </span><br />
		<span>a rock to trip up the two Houses of Israel; </span><br />
		<span>a snare and a trap for the inhabitants of Jerusalem,</span><br />
		<span>over which many of them will stumble, fall and be broken, </span><br />
		<span>be ensnared and made captive.</span><br />
		<span>Bind up the testimony, seal the instruction </span><br />
		<span>in the heart of my disciples”.</span><br />
		<span>My trust is in Yahweh who hides his face from the House of Jacob; </span><br />
		<span>I put my hope in him.</span><br />
		<span>Look, I and the children whom Yahweh has given me </span><br />
		<span>shall become signs and portents in Israel on behalf of </span><br />

Isa 10:1 Woe to those who enact unjust decrees, who compose oppressive legislation

Isa 10:2 to deny justice to the weak and to cheat the humblest of my people of fair judgement, to make widows
their prey and to rob the orphan.

Isa 10:3 What will you do on the day of punishment, when disaster comes from far away? To whom will you run
for help and where will you leave your riches,

Isa 10:4 to avoid squatting among the captives or falling among the slain? After all this, his anger is not spent.
No, his hand is still raised!

Isa 10:5 Woe to Assyria, rod of my anger, the club in their hands is my fury!

Isa 10:6 I was sending him against a godless nation, commissioning him against the people who enraged me, to
pillage and plunder at will and trample on them like the mud in the streets.

Isa 10:7 But this was not his intention nor did his heart plan it so, for he dreamed of putting an end to them, of
liquidating nations without number!

Isa 10:8 For he thought, “Are not my officers all kings?

Isa 10:9 Is not Calno like Carchemish, Hamath like Arpad, Samaria like Damascus?

Isa 10:10 As my hand has found the kingdoms of the false gods, where there were more images than in
Jerusalem and Samaria,

Isa 10:1 1 as I have treated Samaria and her false gods shall I not treat Jerusalem and her statues too?”.

Isa 10:12 When the Lord has completed all his work on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, he will punish the fruit of
the king of Assyria’s boastful heart and the insolence of his haughty looks.

Isa 10:13 For he thinks: “By the strength of my own arm I have done this and by my own wisdom: how intelligent
I have been! I have abolished the frontiers between peoples, I have plundered their treasures, like a hero, I have
subjugated their inhabitants.

Isa 10:14 My hand has found, as though a bird’s nest, the riches of the peoples. Like someöne collecting
deserted eggs, I have collected the whole world while no one has fluttered a wing or opened a beak to squawk”.
Isa 10:15 Does the axe claim more credit than the man who wields it, or the saw more strength than the man
who handles it? As though a staff controlled those who raise it, or the club could raise what is not made of wood!
Isa 10:16 That is why Yahweh Sabaoth is going to inflict leanness on his stout men, and beneath his glory
kindle a fever burning like a fire.

Isa 10:17 The light of Israel will become a fire and its Holy One a flame burning and devouring his thorn-bushes
and brambles in a day.

Isa 10:18 He will consume his luxuriant forest and productive ground, he will ravage body and soul: it will be like
a consumptive wasting away;

Isa 10:19 and what remain of the trees of his forest will be so few that a child could write their number.

Isa 10:20 When that day comes, the remnant of Israel and the survivors of the House of Jacob will stop relying
on the man who strikes them and will truly rely on Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel.

Isa 10:21 A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.

Isa 10:22 Israel, though your people are like the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will return: a
destruction has been decreed which will make justice overflow,

Isa 10:23 for, throughout the country, the Lord Yahweh Sabaoth will enforce the destruction now decreed.

Isa 10:24 That is why the Lord Yahweh Sabaoth says this: My people who live in Zion, do not be afraid of
Assyria! He may strike you with the rod, he may raise the club against you (on the way from Egypt),

Isa 10:25 but in a very short time the retribution will come to an end, and my anger will destroy them.

Isa 10:26 Yahweh Sabaoth will brandish a whip at him as he struck Midian at Oreb’s Rock, will brandish his rod
at the Sea as he raised it on the way from Egypt.

Isa 10:27 When that day comes, his burden will fall from your shoulder, and his yoke from your neck, and the
yoke will be destroyed …

Isa 10:28 He has reached Aiath, he has moved on to Migron, he has left his baggage train at Michmash.

Isa 10:29 They have passed through the defile, they have bivouacked at Geba. Ramah quaked, Gibeah of Saul
has fled.

Isa 10:30 Cry your loudest, Bath-Gallim! Pay attention, Laish! Answer her, Anathoth!

Isa 10:31 Madmenah has run away, the inhabitants of Gebim have taken cover.

Isa 10:32 This very day, as he halts at Nob, he will shake his fist at the mountain of the daughter of Zion, the hill



of Jerusalem.

Isa 10:33 See how the Lord Yahweh Sabaoth violently lops off the foliage! The ones standing highest are cut
down, the proudest are laid low!

Isa 10:34 The forest thickets fall beneath the axe, and the Lebanon falls to the blows of a Mighty One.

Isa 1 1 : 1 A shoot will spring from the stock of Jesse, a new shoot will grow from his roots.

Isa 1 1 :2 On him will rest the spirit of Yahweh, the spirit of wisdom and insight, the spirit of counsel and power,
the spirit of knowledge and fear of Yahweh:

Isa 1 1 :3 his inspiration will lie in fearing Yahweh. His judgement will not be by appearances, his verdict not
given on hearsay.

Isa 1 1 :4 He will judge the weak with integrity and give fair sentence for the humblest in the land. He will strike
the country with the rod of his mouth and with the breath of his lips bring death to the wicked.

Isa 1 1 :5 Uprightness will be the belt around his waist, and constancy the belt about his hips.

Isa 1 1 :6 The wolf will live with the lamb, the panther lie down with the kid, calf, lion and fat-stock beast together,
with a little boy to lead them.

Isa 1 1 :7 The cow and the bear will graze, their young will lie down together. The lion will eat hay like the ox.

Isa 1 1 :8 The infant will play over the den of the adder; the baby will put his hand into the viper’s lair.

Isa 11:9 No hurt, no harm will be done on all my holy mountain, for the country will be full of knowledge of
Yahweh as the waters cover the sea.

Isa 11:10 That day, the root of Jesse, standing as a signal for the peoples, will be sought out by the nations and
its home will be glorious.

Isa 11:11 When that day comes, the Lord will raise his hand a second time to ransom the remnant of his people,
those still left, from Assyria, from Egypt, from Pathros, Cush and Elam, from Shinar, Hamath and the islands of
the Sea.

Isa 1 1:12 He will hoist a signal for the nations and assemble the outcasts of Israel; he will gather the scattered
people of Judah from the four corners of the earth.

Isa 11:13 Then Ephraim’s jealousy will cease and Judah’s enemies be suppressed; Ephraim will no longer be
jealous of Judah nor Judah any longer hostile to Ephraim,

Isa 11:14 but together they will swoop on the Philistines’ back, to the west, and together pillage the people of
the east. Edom and Moab will be subject to their sway and the Ammonites will obey them.

Isa 11:15 Then Yahweh will dry up the gulf of the Sea of Egypt, he will raise his hand against the River with the
heat of his breath. He will divide it into seven streams for them to cross dry-shod.

Isa 11:16 And there will be a highway for the remnant of his people for those still left, from Assyria, as there was
for Israel when he came out of Egypt.

Isa 12:1 And, that day, you will say: “I praise you, Yahweh, you have been angry with me but your anger is now
appeased and you have comforted me.

Isa 12:2 Look, he is the God of my salvation: I shall have faith and not be afraid, for Yahweh is my strength and
my song, he has been my salvation”.

Isa 12:3 Joyfully you will draw water from the springs of salvation

Isa 12:4 and, that day, you will say, “Praise Yahweh, invoke his name. Proclaim his deeds to the people, declare
his name sublime.

Isa 12:5 Sing of Yahweh, for his works are majestic, make them known throughout the world.

Isa 12:6 Cry and shout for joy, you who live in Zion, For the Holy One of Israel is among you in his greatness”.

		<span>Look, the Day of Yahweh is coming, </span><br />
		<span>merciless, with wrath and burning anger, </span><br />
		<span>to reduce the country to a desert </span><br />
		<span>and root out the sinners from it.</span><br />
		<span>For in the sky the stars and Orion </span><br />
		<span>will shed their light no longer, </span><br />
		<span>the sun will be dark when it rises, </span><br />
		<span>and the moon will no longer give its light.</span><br />
		<span>I am going to punish the world for its wickedness </span><br />
		<span>and the wicked for their guilt, </span><br />
		<span>and put an end to the pride of the arrogant </span><br />
		<span>and humble the haughtiness of despots.</span><br />
		<span>I shall make people scarcer than pure gold, </span><br />
		<span>human life scarcer than the gold of Ophir.</span><br />
		<span>This is why I am going to shake the heavens, </span><br />
		<span>why the earth will reel on its foundations, </span><br />
		<span>under the wrath of Yahweh Sabaoth, </span><br />
		<span>the day when his anger ignites.</span><br />
		<span>Then like a hunted gazelle, like sheep that nobody gathers in, </span><br />
		<span>everyone will head back to his people,</span><br />
		<span>everyone will flee to his native land.</span><br />
		<span>All those who are found will be stabbed, </span><br />
		<span>all those captured will fall by the sword,</span><br />
		<span>their babies dashed to pieces before their eyes, </span><br />
		<span>their houses plundered, their wives raped.</span><br />
		<span>Look, against them I am stirring up the Medes </span><br />
		<span>who care nothing for silver, </span><br />
		<span>who set no value by gold.</span><br />
		<span>Bows will annihilate the young men, </span><br />
		<span>they will have no pity for the fruit of the womb, </span><br />
		<span>or mercy in their eyes for children.</span><br />
		<span>And Babylon, that pearl of kingdoms, </span><br />
		<span>that splendid jewel of the Chaldaeans, </span><br />
		<span>will, like Sodom and Gomorrah, </span><br />
		<span>be overthrown by God.</span><br />
		<span>Never again will anyone live there or reside there </span><br />
		<span>for all generations to come. </span><br />
		<span>Never again will the Arab pitch his tent there, </span><br />

		<span>and owls fill their houses, </span><br />
		<span>there ostriches will settle their home, </span><br />
		<span>there goats will dance.</span><br />
		<span>Hyenas will howl in its towers, </span><br />

<h4>The end of the exile (14:1–2)</h4>

<p>Yahweh will have pity on Jacob, he will choose Israel once more and resettle them on their native soil. Foreigners will join them, attaching themselves to the House of Jacob. Peoples will take them and escort them home, and the House of Israel will take them as slaves, men and women on Yahweh’s soil. They will enslave those who enslaved them and will master their oppressors.</p>

<h4>The conversion of Egypt (19:16–25)</h4>

The land of Judah will become Egypt’s shame; whenever she is reminded of it, she will be terrified, because of the plan which Yahweh Sabaoth has laid against her. That day in Egypt there will be five towns speaking the language of Canaan and pledging themselves to Yahweh Sabaoth; one of them will be called City of the Sun. That day there will be an altar dedicated to Yahweh in the centre of Egypt and, close to the frontier, a pillar dedicated to Yahweh, and this will be a sign and a witness to Yahweh Sabaoth in Egypt. When they cry to Yahweh for help because of oppressors, he will send them a Saviour and leader to deliver them. Yahweh will reveal himself to Egypt, and the Egyptians will acknowledge Yahweh that day and will offer sacrifices and cereal offerings, and will make vows to Yahweh and perform them. And if Yahweh strikes Egypt, having struck he will heal, and they will turn to Yahweh who will hear their prayers and heal them. That day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. Assyria will have access to Egypt and Egypt have access to Assyria. Egypt will serve with Assyria.</p>

<p>That day Israel will make a third with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing at the centre of the world, and Yahweh Sabaoth will bless them in the words, “Blessed be my people Egypt, Assyria my creation, and Israel my heritage”.</p>

<h4>Relating to the capture of Ashdod (20:1–6)</h4>

<p>The year the general-in-chief, sent by Sargon king of Assyria, came to Ashdod and stormed and captured it at that time Yahweh spoke through Isaiah son of Amoz and said, “Go, undo the sackcloth round your waist and take the sandals off your feet”. And he did so, and walked about, naked and barefoot. Yahweh then said, “As my servant Isaiah has been walking about naked and barefoot for the last three years as a sign and portent for Egypt and Cush, so the king of Assyria will lead the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Cush, young and old, naked and barefoot, their buttocks bared, to the shame of Egypt. Then they will be afraid and ashamed of Cush their hope and Egypt their pride, and the inhabitants of this coast will say on that day, ‘Look what has happened to our hope, to those to whom we fled for help, to escape from the king of Assyria. How are we going to escape?’”.</p>

<h4>The fall of Babylon (21:1–17)</h4>

<p>Proclamation about the coastal desert:</p> 

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>As whirlwinds sweeping over the Negeb,</span><br />
		<span>he comes from the desert, from a fearsome country.</span><br />
		<span>A harsh vision has been shown me,</span><br />
		<span>“The traitor betrays and the despoiler despoils.</span><br />
		<span>Advance, Elam, lay siege, Media!”.</span><br />
		<span>I have cut short all groaning.</span><br />
		<span>This is why my loins are racked with pain,</span><br />
		<span>why I am seized with pangs like the pangs of a woman in labour;</span><br />
		<span>I am too distressed to hear, too afraid to look.</span><br />
		<span>My heart is bewildered, dread overwhelms me,</span><br />
		<span>the twilight I longed for has become my horror.</span><br />
		<span>They lay the table, spread the cloth,</span><br />
		<span>they eat, they drink.</span><br />
		<span>Up, princes, grease the shield!</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>For this is what the Lord has told me,</span><br />
		<span>“Go, post a look-out, let him report what he sees.</span><br />
		<span>He will see cavalry, horsemen two by two,</span><br />
		<span>men mounted on donkeys, men mounted on camels;</span><br />
		<span>let him watch alertly, be very alert indeed!”.</span><br />
		<span>Then the look-out shouted,</span><br />
		<span>“On the watchtower, Lord,</span><br />
		<span>I stay all day</span><br />
		<span>and at my post</span><br />
		<span>I stand all night.</span><br />
		<span>Now the cavalry is coming, horsemen two by two”.</span><br />
		<span>He shouted again and said,</span><br />
		<span>“Babylon has fallen, has fallen,</span><br />
		<span>and all the images of her gods he has shattered to the ground!”.</span><br />
		<span>You whom I have threshed, grain of my threshing-floor,</span><br />
		<span>what I have heard from Yahweh Sabaoth, God of Israel,</span><br />
		<span>I am telling you now.</span>

<h4>On Edom (21:11–12)</h4>

<p>Proclamation about Dumah:</p> 

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>From Seir, someöne shouts to me,</span><br />
		<span>“Watchman, what time of night?</span><br />
		<span>Watchman, what time of night?”.</span>

	<p class="poem">
		<span>The watchman answers,</span><br />

		<span>Come back! Come here!”.</span>

<h4>Against the Arabs (21:13–15)</h4>

<p>Proclamation about the wastelands:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span> In the thickets, on the wastelands, you spend the night,</span><br />
		<span>you caravans of Dedanites.</span><br />
		<span>Bring water for the thirsty!</span><br />
		<span>The inhabitants of Tema went</span><br />
		<span>with bread to greet the fugitive.</span><br />
		<span>For these have fled before the sword,</span><br />
		<span>the naked sword and the bent bow,</span><br />
		<span>the press of battle.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For this is what the Lord has told me,</p> 

<p>“In one year’s time as a hired worker reckons it, all the glory of Kedar will be finished and, of the valiant archers, the Kedarites, hardly any will be left, for Yahweh, God of Israel, has spoken”.</p>

<h4>Against rejoicing in Jerusalem (22:1–14)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Now what is the matter with you</span><br />
		<span>for you all to be up on the housetops,</span><br />
		<span>full of excitement, boisterous town, joyful city?</span><br />
		<span>Your slain have not fallen to the sword</span><br />
		<span>nor died in battle.</span><br />
		<span>Your leaders have all fled together,</span><br />
		<span>captured without a bow between them,</span><br />
		<span>all who could be found have been captured at a blow,</span><br />
		<span>far though they had fled.</span><br />
		<span>That is why I said, “Turn your eyes away from me,</span><br />

		<span>over the ruin of the daughter of my people”.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>For this is a day of rout, panic and confusion,</span><br />
		<span>the work of the Lord Yahweh Sabaoth</span><br />

		<span>cries for help ring out to the mountains.</span><br />
		<span>Elam has picked up his quiver,</span><br />

	<p class="poem">
		<span>That day you turned your gaze</span><br />

		<span>You surveyed the houses in Jerusalem</span><br />
		<span>and pulled houses down to strengthen the wall.</span><br />
		<span>Between the two walls you made a reservoir</span><br />
		<span>for the waters of the old pool.</span><br />

	<p class="poem">

		<span>eating of meat, drinking of wine,</span><br />
		<span>“Let us eat and drink,</span><br />

<h4>Against Shebna (22:15–25)</h4>

<p>The Lord Yahweh Sabaoth says this:</p> 

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">

		<span>“What do you own here, who gave you the right</span><br />

		<span>He is hewing himself a tomb,</span><br />
		<span>is digging a resting-place for himself in the rock.</span><br />
		<span>But Yahweh will throw you away, strong as you are,</span><br />
		<span>will grasp you in his grip,</span><br />
		<span>will screw you up into a ball,</span><br />
		<span>a ball thrown into a vast space.</span><br />
		<span>There you will die, with your splendid chariots,</span><br />
		<span>disgrace to your master’s palace!</span><br />
		<span>I shall hound you from your office,</span><br />
		<span>I shall snatch you from your post</span><br />
		<span>and, when that day comes,</span><br />
		<span>I shall summon my servant</span><br />
		<span>Eliakim son of Hilkiah.</span><br />
		<span>I shall dress him in your tunic,</span><br />
		<span>I shall put your sash round his waist,</span><br />
		<span>I shall invest him with your authority;</span><br />

<p>“On him will depend all the glory of his family, the descendants and offspring, all the vessels of small capacity too, from cups to pitchers. That day, declares Yahweh Sabaoth, the nail driven into a firm place will give way, will be torn out and fall. And the whole load hanging on it will be lost. For Yahweh has spoken”.</p>

<h4>Against Tyre (23:1–18)</h4>

<p>Proclamation about Tyre:</p>

	<p class="poem">

	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When that day comes, Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, the length of one king’s life. But when the seventy years are over, Tyre will become like the whore in the song:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>“Take your harp, walk the town,</span><br />
		<span>whore whom men have forgotten!</span><br />
		<span>Play sweetly, song after song,</span><br />
		<span>to make them remember you”.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the end of the seventy years Yahweh will visit Tyre. She will receive her pay again and play the whore with all the kingdoms of the world on the surface of the earth. But her profits and wages will be dedicated to Yahweh. They will not be stored or hoarded, but her profits will go to those who live in Yahweh’s presence, for them to have as much food as they want and splendid clothes.</p>
<hr />
Isa 24:1 See how Yahweh lays the earth waste, makes it a desert, buckles its surface, scatters its inhabitants,
Isa 24:2 priest and people alike, master and slave, mistress and maid, seller and buyer, lender and borrower,
creditor and debtor.

Isa 24:3 Ravaged, ravaged the earth will be, despoiled, despoiled, for Yahweh has uttered this word.

Isa 24:4 The earth is mourning, pining away, the pick of earth’s people are withering away.

Isa 24:5 The earth is defiled by the feet of its inhabitants, for they have transgressed the laws, violated the
decree, broken the everlasting covenant.

Isa 24:6 That is why the curse has consumed the earth and its inhabitants pay the penalty, that is why the
inhabitants of the earth have been burnt up and few people are left.

Isa 24:7 The new wine is mourning, the vine is withering away, the once merry-hearted are sighing.

Isa 24:8 The cheerful sound of tambourines is silent, the sound of revelling is over, the cheerful sound of the
harp is silent.

Isa 24:9 No more will they sing over their wine, liquor will taste bitter to the drinker.

Isa 24:10 The city of nothingness is in ruins, every house is shut, no one can enter.

Isa 24:1 1 People shout in the streets to try to get wine; all joy has vanished, happiness has been banished from
the country.

Isa 24:12 Nothing but rubble in the city, the gate has collapsed in ruins.

Isa 24:13 For at the heart of earth’s life, among the peoples, it is as at the beating of the olive trees, as at the
gleaning of the grapes when the grape harvest is over.

Isa 24:14 They raise their voices, shouting for joy, in Yahweh’s honour they shout from the west.

Isa 24:15 “Yes, in the east, give glory to Yahweh, in the islands of the sea, to the name of Yahweh, God of
Israel!”.

Isa 24:16 We have heard psalms from the remotest parts of earth, “Glory to the Upright One!”. But I thought,
“What an ordeal, what an ordeal! What misery for me!”. The traitors have betrayed, the traitors have acted most
treacherously.

Isa 24:17 Fear, the pit and the snare for you, inhabitants of the city!

Isa 24:18 And whoëver flees from the cry of fear will fall into the pit, and whoëver climbs out of the pit will be
caught in the snare. Yes, the sluice-gates above are open, the foundations of the earth are quaking.

Isa 24:19 A cracking, the earth cracks open, a jolting, the earth gives a jolt, a lurching, the earth lurches
backwards and forwards.

Isa 24:20 The earth will reel to and fro like a drunkard, it will be shaken like a shanty; so heavy will be its sin on
it, it will fall, never to rise again.

Isa 24:21 When that day comes, Yahweh will punish the armies of the sky above and on earth the kings of the
earth;

Isa 24:22 they will be herded together, herded together like prisoners in a dungeon and shut up in gaol, and,
after long years, punished.

Isa 24:23 The moon will be confused and the sun ashamed, for Yahweh Sabaoth is king on Mount Zion and in
Jerusalem, and the Glory will radiate on their elders.



Isa 25:1 Yahweh, you are my God, I shall praise you to the heights, I shall praise your name; for you have
accomplished marvels, plans long-conceived, faithfully, firmly.

Isa 25:2 For you have made the town a heap of stones, the fortified city a ruin. The foreigners’ citadel is a city
no longer, it will never be rebuilt.

Isa 25:3 Hence mighty peoples will honour you, the city of pitiless nations hold you in awe;

Isa 25:4 For you have been a refuge for the weak, a refuge for the needy in distress, a shelter from the storm,
shade from the heat; for the breath of the pitiless is like a winter storm.

Isa 25:5 Like heat in a dry land you calm the foreigners’ tumult; as heat under the shadow of a cloud, so the
song of the pitiless dies away.

Isa 25:6 On this mountain, for all peoples, Yahweh Sabaoth is preparing a banquet of rich food, a banquet of
fine wines, of succulent food, of well-strained wines.

Isa 25:7 On this mountain, he has destroyed the veil which used to veil all peoples, the pall enveloping all
nations;

Isa 25:8 he has destroyed death for ever. Lord Yahweh has wiped away the tears from every cheek; he has
taken his people’s shame away everywhere on earth, for Yahweh has spoken.

Isa 25:9 And on that day, it will be said, “Look, this is our God, in him we put our hope that he should save us,
this is Yahweh, we put our hope in him. Let us exult and rejoice since he has saved us”.

Isa 25:10 For Yahweh’s hand will rest on this mountain, and Moab will be trodden under his feet as straw is
trodden into the dung-heap.

Isa 25:1 1 He may stretch his hands wide on the mountain like a swimmer stretching out his hands to swim. But
he will humble his pride despite what his hands may attempt.

Isa 25:12 And the impregnable fortress of your walls, he has overthrown, laid low, flung to the ground, in the
dust.

Isa 26:1 That day, this song will be sung in Judah: “We have a fortress city, the walls and ramparts provide
safety.

Isa 26:2 Open the gates! Let the upright nation come in, the nation that keeps faith!

Isa 26:3 This is the plan decreed: you will guarantee peace, the peace entrusted to you.

Isa 26:4 Trust in Yahweh for ever, for Yahweh is a rock for ever.

Isa 26:5 He has brought low the dwellers on the heights, the lofty citadel; he lays it low, brings it to the ground,
flings it down in the dust.

Isa 26:6 It will be trodden under foot, by the feet of the needy, the steps of the weak”.

Isa 26:7 The path of the Upright One is honesty; you smooth the honest way of the upright.

Isa 26:8 Following the path of your judgements, Yahweh, we set our hopes in you, your name, your memory are
all our soul desires.

Isa 26:9 At night my soul longs for you and my spirit within me seeks you out; for when your judgements appear
on earth the inhabitants of the world learn what saving justice is.

Isa 26:10 If pity is shown to the wicked without his learning what saving justice is, he will act wrongly in the land
of right conduct and not see the majesty of Yahweh.

Isa 26:1 1 Yahweh, your hand is raised but they do not see! The antagonists of your people will look and grow
pale; with your fiery wrath you will devour your enemies.

Isa 26:12 Yahweh, you will grant us peace, having completed all our undertakings for us.

Isa 26:13 Yahweh our God, other lords than you have ruled us but, loyal to you alone, we invoke your name.

Isa 26:14 The dead will not come back to life, the shadows will not rise again, for you have punished them,
annihilated them, wiping out their very memory.

Isa 26:15 You have made the nation larger, Yahweh, made the nation larger and won yourself glory, you have
rolled back the frontiers of the country.

Isa 26:16 Yahweh, in distress they had recourse to you, they expended themselves in prayer, since your
punishment was on them.

Isa 26:17 As a pregnant woman near her time of delivery writhes and cries out in her pangs, so have we been,
Yahweh, in your eyes:

Isa 26:18 we have been pregnant, we have writhed, but we have given birth only to wind: we have not given
salvation to the earth, no inhabitants for the world have been brought to birth.

Isa 26:19 Your dead will come back to life, your corpses will rise again. Wake up and sing, you dwellers in the
dust, for your dew will be a radiant dew, but the earth will give birth to the shades.

Isa 26:20 Go, my people, go to your private room, shut yourselves in. Hide yourselves a little while until the
retribution has passed.

Isa 26:21 For see, Yahweh emerges from his dwelling to punish the inhabitants of earth for their guilt; and the
earth will reveal the blood shed on it and no longer hide its slain.

Isa 27:1 That day Yahweh will punish, with his unyielding sword, massive and strong, Leviathan the fleeing



serpent, Leviathan the coiling serpent; he will kill that dragon that lives in the sea.

Isa 27:2 That day, sing of the splendid vineyard!

Isa 27:3 I, Yahweh, am its guardian, from time to time I water it; so that no harm befall it, I guard it night and
day.

Isa 27:4 -I do not have a wall. Who can reduce me to brambles and thorn-bushes? -I shall make war and
trample on it and at the same time burn it.

Isa 27:5 Or should they beg for my protection, let them make their peace with me, peace let them make with
me.

Isa 27:6 In days to come, Jacob will take root, Israel will bud and blossom and the surface of the world be one
vast harvest.

Isa 27:7 Has he struck him as he was struck by those who struck him? Has he murdered him as he was
murdered by those who murdered him?

Isa 27:8 By expelling, by excluding him, you have executed a sentence, he has blown him away with a breath
as rough as the east wind.

Isa 27:9 For that is how Jacob’s guilt will be forgiven, such will be the result of renouncing his sin, when all the
altar-stones have been smashed to pieces like lumps of chalk, when the sacred poles and incense-altars stand
no longer.

Isa 27:10 For the fortified city is abandoned now, deserted, forsaken as a desert where calves browse, where
they lie down, destroying its branches.

Isa 27:1 1 When boughs go dry, they get burnt, women come and use them for firewood. Now, this is a people
that does not understand, and so its Maker will not take pity on it, he who formed it will not show it any mercy.

Isa 27:12 When that day comes, Yahweh will start his threshing from the course of the River to the Torrent of
Egypt, and you will be gathered one by one, Israelites!

Isa 27:13 When that day comes, the great ram’s-horn will be sounded, and those lost in Assyria will come, and
those banished to Egypt, and they will worship Yahweh on the holy mountain, in Jerusalem.

Isa 28:1 Woe to the haughty crown of Ephraim’s drunkards, to the fading flower of its proud splendour sited at
the head of the lush valley, to those prostrated by wine!

Isa 28:2 See, a strong and mighty man in the Lord’s service, like a storm of hail, a destroying tempest, like
immense flood-waters overflowing, with his hand he throws them to the ground.

Isa 28:3 They will be trampled underfoot, the haughty crown of Ephraim’s drunkards,

Isa 28:4 and the faded flower of its proud splendour sited at the head of the lush valley. Like a fig ripe before
summer comes: whoëver spots it forthwith picks and swallows it.

Isa 28:5 That day Yahweh Sabaoth will be a crown of splendour and a proud diadem for the remnant of his
people,

Isa 28:6 a spirit of fair judgement for him who sits in judgement, and the strength of those who repel the assault
on the gate.

Isa 28:7 These too have been confused by wine, have gone astray owing to liquor. Priest and prophet have
become confused by liquor, are sodden with wine, have strayed owing to liquor, have become confused in their
visions, have strayed in their decisions.

Isa 28:8 Yes, every table is covered in filthy vomit, not one is clean!

Isa 28:9 “Whom does he think he is lecturing? Whom does he think his message is for? Babies just weaned?
Babies just taken from the breast?

Isa 28:10 With his ‘Sav lasav, sav lasav, kav lakav, kav lakav, zeer sham, zeer sham!’.

Isa 28:1 1 Now, with stammering lips and in a foreign language, he will talk to this nation.

Isa 28:12 He used to say to them, “Here you can rest! Here you can let the weary rest! Here all is quiet”. But they
refused to listen.

Isa 28:13 Now Yahweh is going to say this to them, “Sav lasav, sav lasav, kav lakav, kav lakav, zeer sham, zeer
sham”. So that when they walk they will fall over backwards and so be broken, trapped and taken captive.

Isa 28:14 Hence listen to Yahweh’s word, you insolent men, rulers of this people in Jerusalem.

Isa 28:15 Because you have said, “We have made a treaty with Death and have struck a pact with Sheol. When
the scourging flood comes over, it will not touch us, for we have made lies our refuge and hidden under
falsehood”.

Isa 28:16 So the Lord Yahweh says this, “Now I shall lay a stone in Zion, a granite stone, a precious corner-
stone, a firm foundation-stone: no one who relies on this will stumble.

Isa 28:17 And I will make fair judgement the measure, and uprightness the plumb-line”. But hail will sweep away
the refuge of lies and floods wash away the hiding-place;

Isa 28:18 your treaty with Death will be broken and your pact with Sheol will not hold. When the scourging flood
comes over, you will be trodden down by it;

Isa 28:19 every time it comes over, it will seize on you, for it will come over, morning after morning, day by day



and night by night. Nothing but fear will make you understand what you hear.

Isa 28:20 For the bed is too short to stretch in, the blanket too narrow for covering.

Isa 28:21 Yes, as on Mount Perazim, Yahweh will rise, as in the Valley of Gibeon, he will storm to do his work,

his mysterious work, to do his deed, his extraordinary deed.

Isa 28:22 Stop scoffing, then, or your bonds will be tightened further, for I have heard it: it has been irrevocably
decided as regards the whole country by the Lord Yahweh Sabaoth.

Isa 28:23 Listen closely to my words, be attentive, understand what I am saying.

Isa 28:24 Does the ploughman plough all day to sow, breaking up and harrowing his ground?

Isa 28:25 Once he has levelled its surface, does he not scatter fennel, sow cummin? Then he puts in wheat,

millet, barley and, round the edges, spelt,

Isa 28:26 for his God has taught him this rule and instructed him.

Isa 28:27 Fennel must not be crushed with a sledge, nor cart-wheels driven over cummin; fennel must be
beaten with a stick, and cummin with a flail.

Isa 28:28 When you are threshing wheat, you do not waste time crushing it; you get the horse and cart-wheel
moving, but you do not grind it fine.

Isa 28:29 All this is a gift from Yahweh Sabaoth, marvellous advice leading to great achievements.

Isa 29:1 Woe, Ariel, Ariel, city where David encamped. Let year after year pass, let the feasts make their full
round,

Isa 29:2 then I shall inflict trouble on Ariel, and there will be sighing and sobbing, and I shall make it truly Ariel.
Isa 29:3 I shall encamp all round you, I shall lay siege to you and mount siege-works against you.

Isa 29:4 You will be laid low, will speak from the underworld, your words will rise like a murmur from the dust.
Your voice from the earth will be like a ghost’s, it will whisper as though coming from the dust.

Isa 29:5 The horde of your enemies will be like fine dust, the horde of the warriors like flying chaff. And
suddenly, in an instant,

Isa 29:6 you will be visited by Yahweh Sabaoth with thunder, earthquake, mighty din, hurricane, tempest, flame
of devouring fire.

Isa 29:7 It will be like a dream, like a vision at night: the horde of all the nations at war with Ariel, all those
fighting, besieging and troubling it.

Isa 29:8 It will be like the dream of a hungry man: he eats, then wakes up with an empty belly; or like the dream
of a thirsty man: he drinks, then wakes up exhausted with a parched throat. So will it be with the horde of all the
nations making war on Mount Zion.

Isa 29:9 Be stupefied and stunned, go blind, unseeing, drunk but not on wine, staggering but not through liquor.
Isa 29:10 For Yahweh has infused you with a spirit of lethargy, he has closed your eyes (the prophets), he has
veiled your heads (the seers).

Isa 29:1 1 For to you every vision has become like the words of a sealed book. You give it to someöne able to
read and say, “Read that”. He replies, “I cannot, because it is sealed”.

Isa 29:12 You then give the book to someöne who cannot read, and say, “Read that”. He replies, “I cannot read”.
Isa 29:13 The Lord then said: Because this people approaches me only in words, honours me only with lip-
service while their hearts are far from me, and reverence for me, as far as they are concerned, is nothing but
human commandment, a lesson memorised,

Isa 29:14 very well, I shall have to go on astounding this people with prodigies and wonders: for the wisdom of
its wise men is doomed, the understanding of any who understand will vanish.

Isa 29:15 Woe to those who burrow down to conceal their plans from Yahweh, who scheme in the dark and say,
“Who can see us? Who knows who we are?”.

Isa 29:16 How perverse you are! Is the potter no better than the clay? Something that was made, can it say of
its maker, “He did not make me'? Or a pot say of the potter, “He does not know his job'?

Isa 29:17 Is it not true that in a very short time the Lebanon will become productive ground, so productive you
might take it for a forest?

Isa 29:18 That day the deaf will hear the words of the book and, delivered from shadow and darkness, the eyes
of the blind will see.

Isa 29:19 The lowly will find ever more joy in Yahweh and the poorest of people will delight in the Holy One of
Israel;

Isa 29:20 for the tyrant will be no more, the scoffer has vanished and all those on the look-out for evil have been
destroyed:

Isa 29:21 those who incriminate others by their words, those who lay traps for the arbitrator at the gate and
groundlessly deprive the upright of fair judgement.

Isa 29:22 That is why Yahweh, God of the House of Jacob, Abraham’s redeemer, says this, “No longer shall
Jacob be disappointed, no more shall his face grow pale,

Isa 29:23 for when he sees his children, my creatures, home again with him, he will acknowledge my name as



holy, he will acknowledge the Holy One of Jacob to be holy and will hold the God of Israel in awe.

Isa 29:24 Erring spirits will learn to understand and murmurers accept instruction”.

Isa 30:1 Woe to the rebellious children — declares Yahweh — who make plans which do not come from me and
make alliances not inspired by me, and so add sin to sin!

Isa 30:2 They are leaving for Egypt, without consulting me, to take refuge in Pharaoh’s protection, to shelter in
Egypt’s shadow.

Isa 30:3 Pharaoh’s protection will be your shame, the shelter of Egypt’s shadow your confounding.

Isa 30:4 For his princes have gone to Zoan and his messengers have reached Hanes.

Isa 30:5 Everyone has been disappointed by a people who cannot help, who bring neither aid nor profit, only
disappointment and confusion.

Isa 30:6 Proclamation about the beasts of the Negeb: Into the land of distress and of anguish, of lioness and
roaring lion, of viper and flying dragon, they bear their riches on donkeys’ backs, their treasures on camels’
humps, to a nation that cannot help:

Isa 30:7 Egypt, whose help is vain and futile; and so I call her ‘Rahab -the-collapsed’.

Isa 30:8 Now go, inscribe this on a tablet, write it on a scroll, so that it may serve for time to come for ever and
for ever.

Isa 30:9 This is a rebellious people, they are lying children, children who will not listen to Yahweh’s Law.

Isa 30:10 To the seers they say, “See nothing!”. To the prophets, “Do not prophesy the truth to us; tell us flattering
things; have illusory visions;

Isa 30:1 1 turn aside from the way, leave the path, rid us of the Holy One of Israel”.

Isa 30:12 So the Holy One of Israel says this, “Since you have rejected this word and put your trust in fraud and
disloyalty and rely on these,

Isa 30:13 for you this guilt will prove to be a breach opening up, a bulge at the top of a wall which suddenly and
all at once comes crashing down.

Isa 30:14 He will shatter it like an earthenware pot, ruthlessly knocking it to pieces, so that of the fragments not
one shard can be found with which to take up fire from the hearth or scoop water from the storage-well”.

Isa 30:15 For Lord Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel, says this, “Your salvation lay in conversion and tranquillity,
your strength in serenity and trust and you would have none of it.

Isa 30:16 ‘No’, you said, ‘we shall flee on horses’. And so flee you will! And again, ‘We shall ride on swift
ones’. And so your pursuers will be swift!

Isa 30:17 A thousand will quake at the threat of one and when five threaten you will flee, until what is left of you
will be like a flagstaff on a mountain top, like a signal on a hill”.

Isa 30:18 But Yahweh is waiting to be gracious to you, the Exalted One, to take pity on you, for Yahweh is a
God of fair judgement; blessed are all who hope in him.

Isa 30:19 Yes, people of Zion living in Jerusalem, you will weep no more. He will be gracious to you when your
cry for help rings out; as soon as he hears it, he will answer you.

Isa 30:20 When the Lord has given you the bread of suffering and the water of distress, he who is your teacher
will hide no longer, and you will see your teacher with your own eyes.

Isa 30:21 Your ears will hear these words behind you, “This is the way, keep to it”, whether you turn to right or
left.

Isa 30:22 You will hold unclean the silverplating of your idols and the goldplating of your images. You will throw
them away like the polluted things they are, shouting after them, “Good riddance!”.

Isa 30:23 He will send rain for the seed you sow in the ground, and the bread that the ground provides will be
rich and nourishing. That day, your cattle will graze in wide pastures.

Isa 30:24 Oxen and donkeys that work the land will eat for fodder wild sorrel, spread by the shovel-load and
fork-load.

Isa 30:25 On every lofty mountain, on every high hill there will be streams and water-courses, on the day of the
great slaughter when the strongholds fall.

Isa 30:26 Then moonlight will be bright as sunlight and sunlight itself be seven times brighter — like the light of
seven days in one — on the day Yahweh dresses his people’s wound and heals the scars of the blows they have
received.

Isa 30:27 See, the name of Yahweh comes from afar, blazing his anger, heavy his threat. His lips are brimming
over with fury, his tongue is like a devouring fire.

Isa 30:28 His breath is like a river in spate coming up to the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of
destruction, to harness the peoples in a bridle, that will lead them astray.

Isa 30:29 Your song will be like that on a festal night, and there will be joy in your hearts as when to the sound
of the flute people make a pilgrimage to the mountain of Yahweh, the Rock of Israel.

Isa 30:30 Yahweh will make his majestic voice ring out, he will show the weight of his arm in the heat of his
anger, with a devouring fire, with thunderbolt, downpour and hailstones.



Isa 30:31 Yes, at Yahweh’s voice Assyria will be terrified, he will strike him with his rod;

Isa 30:32 each time he goes by, will fall the punishing rod that Yahweh will lay on him, to the sound of
tambourines and harps, in the battles which he will wage against him with uplifted hand.

Isa 30:33 Yes, Topheth has been ready for a long time now, that too is ready for the king, deep and wide his
pyre, fire and wood in plenty. Yahweh’s breath, like a stream of brimstone, will set fire to it.

Isa 31:1 Woe to those going down to Egypt for help, who put their trust in horses, who rely on the quantity of
chariots, and on great strength of cavalrymen, but do not look to the Holy One of Israel or consult Yahweh.

Isa 31 :2 Yet he too is wise and can bring disaster and he will not go back on his word; he will rise against the
breed of evil-doers and against those who protect wrong-doers.

Isa 31:3 The Egyptian is human, not divine, his horses are flesh, not spirit; Yahweh will stretch out his hand: the
protector will stumble, the protected will fall and all will perish together.

Isa 31 :4 Yes, this is what Yahweh has said to me: As a lion or lion cub growls over its prey, when scores of
shepherds are summoned to drive it off, without being frightened by their shouting or cowed by the noise they
make, just so will Yahweh Sabaoth descend to fight for Mount Zion and for its hill.

Isa 31:5 Like hovering birds, so will Yahweh Sabaoth protect Jerusalem; by protecting it, he will save it, by
supporting it, he will deliver it.

Isa 31 :6 Come back to the one whom the Israelites have so deeply betrayed!

Isa 31 :7 For, that day, each of you will throw away the false gods of silver and the false gods of gold which your
own sinful hands have made.

Isa 31 :8 Assyria will fall by the sword, not that of a man, will be devoured by the sword, of no human being, he
will flee before the sword and his young warriors will be enslaved.

Isa 31:9 In his terror he will abandon his rock, and his panic-stricken officers desert the standard — declares
Yahweh, whose fire is in Zion, whose furnace, in Jerusalem.

Isa 32:1 There will be a king who reigns uprightly and princes who rule with fair judgement;

Isa 32:2 each will be like a shelter from the wind, a refuge from the storm, like streams on arid ground, like the
shade of a solid rock in a desolate land.

Isa 32:3 The eyes of seers will no longer be closed, the ears of hearers will be alert,

Isa 32:4 the heart of the hasty will learn to think things over, and the tongue of stammerers will speak promptly
and clearly.

Isa 32:5 The fool will no longer be called generous, nor the rascal be styled bountiful.

Isa 32:6 For the fool speaks folly and his heart is set on villainy; he is godless in his actions and his words
ascribe error to Yahweh; he starves the hungry of their food and refuses drink to the thirsty.

Isa 32:7 Everything to do with the rascal is evil, he devises infamous plans to ruin the poor with lying words
even when the needy has right on his side;

Isa 32:8 but the noble person plans only noble things, noble his every move.

Isa 32:9 Stand up, you haughty women, listen to my words; you over-confident daughters, pay attention to what
I say.

Isa 32:10 Within one year and a few days you will tremble, you over-confident women; grape-harvesting will be
finished, gathering will never happen again.

Isa 32:1 1 Shudder, you haughty women, tremble, you over-confident women; strip, undress, put sackcloth
round your waists.

Isa 32:12 Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine,

Isa 32:13 for my people’s soil where the bramble-bush will be growing and for all the happy houses, for the
rejoicing city.

Isa 32:14 For the citadel will be abandoned and the thronged city deserted, Ophel and the Keep will be denuded
for ever, the playground of wild donkeys and the pasture of flocks,

Isa 32:15 until the spirit is poured out on us from above, and the desert becomes an orchard, and an orchard
that seems like a forest.

Isa 32:16 Fair judgement will fix its home in the desert, and uprightness live in this orchard,

Isa 32:17 and the product of uprightness will be peace, the effect of uprightness being quiet and security for
ever.

Isa 32:18 My people will live in a peaceful home, in peaceful houses, tranquil dwellings.

Isa 32:19 And should the forest be totally destroyed and the city gravely humiliated,

Isa 32:20 You will be happy to sow wherever there is water and to let the ox and donkey roam free.

Isa 33:1 Woe to you, destroying though not yourself destroyed, betraying though not yourself betrayed; when
you have finished destroying, you will be destroyed, when you have stopped betraying, you will be betrayed.

Isa 33:2 Yahweh, show us your mercy, we hope in you. Be our arm every morning and our salvation in time of
distress.

Isa 33:3 At the sound of tumult the peoples flee, when you stand up the nations scatter.



Isa 33:4 Your spoil is gathered in as a grasshopper gathers in, like a swarm of locusts people descend on it.

Isa 33:5 Yahweh is exalted, for he is enthroned above, he has filled Zion with fair judgement and saving justice.
Isa 33:6 You can count on this all your days: wisdom and knowledge are the riches that save, the fear of
Yahweh is his treasure.

Isa 33:7 Look, Ariel is lamenting in the streets, the ambassadors of peace are weeping bitterly.

Isa 33:8 The highways are deserted, no travellers any more on the roads. Agreements are broken, witnesses
held in contempt, there is respect for no one.

Isa 33:9 The land pines away in mourning, the Lebanon is withering with shame, Sharon has become like the
wasteland, Bashan and Carmel are shuddering.

Isa 33:10 “Now I shall stand up”, says Yahweh, “now I shall rise, now draw myself up.

Isa 33:1 1 You conceive chaff, you give birth to straw: like fire, my breath will devour you.

Isa 33:12 The peoples will be burnt up as though by quicklime, like cut thorns they will be burnt on the fire.

Isa 33:13 You who are far away, listen to what I have done, and you who are near, realise my strength”.

Isa 33:14 The sinners in Zion are panic-stricken and fear seizes on the godless, “Which of us can survive the
devouring fire, which of us survive everlasting burning?”.

Isa 33:15 The one who acts uprightly and speaks honestly, who scorns to get rich by extortion, who rejects
bribes out of hand, who refuses to listen to plans involving bloodshed and shuts his eyes rather than
countenance crime:

Isa 33:16 such a man will live on the heights, the craggy rocks will be his refuge, he will be fed, he will not want
for water.

Isa 33:17 Your eyes will gaze on the king in his beauty, they will look on a country stretching far and wide.

Isa 33:18 Your heart will meditate on past terrors, “Where is the man who did the counting? Where is the man
who did the weighing? Where is the man who counted off the towers?”.

Isa 33:19 No more will you see that insolent people, that people of unintelligible speech, of barbarous and
meaningless tongue.

Isa 33:20 Gaze at Zion, city of our feasts; your eyes will see Jerusalem as a home that is secure, a tent not to
be moved, none of its tent-pegs ever to be pulled out, none of its guy-ropes ever to be broken.

Isa 33:21 There it is that Yahweh shows us his power, like a place of rivers and very wide canals on which will
row no galley, over which will pass no majestic ship.

Isa 33:22 (For Yahweh is our judge, Yahweh our lawgiver, Yahweh is our king and our Saviour.)

Isa 33:23 Your tackle has given way, it cannot support the mast, it cannot hoist the pennon. And so there is
much booty to be shared out; the lame fall to plundering,

Isa 33:24 and no one living there will say, “I am sickly”; the people living there will find their guilt forgiven.

Isa 34:1 Come near and listen, you nations, pay attention, you peoples. Let the earth and its contents listen, the
world and its entire population.

Isa 34:2 For Yahweh is angry with all the nations, enraged with all their hordes. He has vowed them to
destruction, handed them over to slaughter.

Isa 34:3 Their dead will be thrown away, the stench will rise from their corpses, the mountains will run with their
blood,

Isa 34:4 the entire array of heaven will fall apart. The heavens will be rolled up like a scroll and all their array will
fade away, as fade the leaves falling from the vine, as fade those falling from the fig tree.

Isa 34:5 For my sword has drunk deep in the heavens: see how it now falls on Edom, on the people vowed to
destruction, to punish them.

Isa 34:6 Yahweh’s sword is gorged with blood, it is greasy with fat, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the
fat of the kidneys of rams. For Yahweh has a sacrifice in Bozrah, a great slaughter in the land of Edom.

Isa 34:7 The wild oxen will fall with them, the bullocks with the bulls; their land will be drenched with blood and
their dust will be greasy with fat.

Isa 34:8 For this will be Yahweh’s day of vengeance, the year of retribution in Zion’s lawsuit.

Isa 34:9 Its streams will turn into pitch, its dust into brimstone, its country will turn into blazing pitch.

Isa 34:10 Never quenched night or day, its smoke rising for ever, it will lie waste age after age, no one will travel
through it for ever and ever.

Isa 34:1 1 It will be the haunt of pelican and hedgehog, the owl and the raven will live there; over it Yahweh will
stretch the measuring line of chaos and the plumb-line of emptiness.

Isa 34:12 There will be no more nobles to proclaim the royal authority; there will be an end of all its princes.

Isa 34: 1 3 Brambles will grow in its bastions, nettles and thorn-bushes in its fortresses, it will be the lair of
jackals, an enclosure for ostriches.

Isa 34:14 Wild cats will meet hyenas there, satyr will call to satyr, there Lilith too will lurk and find somewhere to
rest.

Isa 34:15 The snake will nest and lay eggs there, will hatch and gather its young into the shade; and there the



vultures will assemble, each one with its mate.

Isa 34:16 Search in Yahweh’s book, and read, not one of these will be missing, not one of them lacking a mate;
for thus his mouth has ordained it, and his spirit has brought them together.

Isa 34:17 He has thrown the lot for each, his hand has measured out their share; they will possess it for ever,
and live there age after age.

Isa 35:1 Let the desert and the dry lands be glad, let the wasteland rejoice and bloom; like the asphodel,

Isa 35:2 let it burst into flower, let it rejoice and sing for joy. The glory of Lebanon is bestowed on it, the
splendour of Carmel and Sharon; then they will see the glory of Yahweh, the splendour of our God.

Isa 35:3 Strengthen all weary hands, steady all trembling knees

Isa 35:4 and say to the faint-hearted, “Be strong! Do not be afraid. Here is your God, vengeance is coming,
divine retribution; he is coming to save you”.

Isa 35:5 Then the eyes of the blind will be opened, the ears of the deaf unsealed,

Isa 35:6 then the lame will leap like a deer and the tongue of the dumb sing for joy; for water will gush in the
desert and streams in the wastelands,

Isa 35:7 the parched ground will become a marsh and the thirsty land springs of water; the lairs where the
jackals used to live will become plots of reed and papyrus.

Isa 35:8 And through it will run a road for them and a highway which will be called the Sacred Way; the unclean
will not be allowed to use it; He will be the one to use this road, the fool will not stray along it.

Isa 35:9 No lion will be there, no ferocious beast set foot on it, nothing of the sort be found; it will be used by the
redeemed.

Isa 35:10 For those whom Yahweh has ransomed will return, they will come to Zion shouting for joy, their heads
crowned with joy unending; rejoicing and gladness will escort them and sorrow and sighing will take flight.

Isa 36:1 In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria advanced on all the fortified towns
of Judah and captured them.

Isa 36:2 From Lachish the king of Assyria sent the cupbearer-in-chief with a large force to King Hezekiah in
Jerusalem. The cupbearer-in-chief took up position near the conduit of the upper pool on the road to the Fuller’s
Field.

Isa 36:3 The master of the palace, Eliakim son of Hilkiah, Shebna the secretary and the herald Joah son of
Asaph went out to him.

Isa 36:4 The cupbearer-in-chief said to them, “Say to Hezekiah, ‘The great king, the king of Assyria, says this:
What makes you so confident?

Isa 36:5 Do you think empty words are as good as strategy and military strength? Who are you relying on, to
dare to rebel against me?

Isa 36:6 There you are, relying on that broken reed, Egypt, which pricks and pierces the hand of the person who
leans on it. That is what Pharaoh king of Egypt is like to all who rely on him.

Isa 36:7 You may say to me: We rely on Yahweh our God. But haven’t his high places and altars been
suppressed by Hezekiah, who told Judah and Jerusalem: This is the altar before which you must worship?

Isa 36:8 Very well, then, make a wager with my lord the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses if
you can find horsemen to ride them.

Isa 36:9 How could you repulse a single one of the least of my master’s soldiers? And yet you have relied on
Egypt for chariots and horsemen.

Isa 36:10 And lastly, have I marched on this country to lay it waste without warrant from Yahweh? Yahweh
himself said to me: March on this country and lay it waste’.

Isa 36:1 1 Eliakim, Shebna and Joah said to the cupbearer-in-chief, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic,
for we understand it; do not speak to us in the Judaean language within earshot of the people on the ramparts”.
Isa 36:12 But the cupbearer-in-chief said, “Do you think my lord sent me here to say these things to your master
or to you? On the contrary, it was to the people sitting on the ramparts who, like you, are doomed to eat their
own dung and drink their own urine”.

Isa 36: 1 3 The cupbearer-in-chief then drew himself up and shouted loudly in the Judaean language, “Listen to
the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.

Isa 36:14 The king says this, ‘Do not let Hezekiah delude you! He will be powerless to save you.

Isa 36:15 Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to rely on Yahweh by saying: Yahweh is sure to save us; this city
will not fall into the king of Assyria’s clutches.

Isa 36:16 Do not listen to Hezekiah, for the king of Assyria says this: Make peace with me,

Isa 36:17 surrender to me, and every one of you will be free to eat the fruit of his own vine and of his own fig
tree and to drink the water of his own storage-well until I come and take you away to a country like your own, a
land of corn and good wine, a land of bread and vineyards.

Isa 36:18 Do not let Hezekiah delude you by saying: Yahweh will save us. Has any god of any nation been able
to save his country from the king of Assyria’s clutches?



Isa 36:19 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Where are the
national gods of Samaria? Did they save Samaria from my clutches?

Isa 36:20 Of all the national gods, which ones have saved their countries from my clutches, that Yahweh should
be able to save Jerusalem from my clutches?’”.

Isa 36:21 They, however, kept quiet and said nothing in reply, since the king had given the order, “You are not to
answer him”.

Isa 36:22 The master of the palace, Eliakim son of Hilkiah, Shebna the secretary and the herald Joah son of
Asaph, with their clothes torn, went to Hezekiah and reported what the cupbearer-in-chief had said.

Isa 37:1 On hearing this, King Hezekiah tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and went to the Temple of Yahweh.

Isa 37:2 He sent Eliakim master of the palace, Shebna the secretary and the elders of the priests, wearing
sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.

Isa 37:3 They said to him, “This is what Hezekiah says, ‘Today is a day of suffering, of punishment, of disgrace.
Children come to birth and there is no strength to bring them forth.

Isa 37:4 May Yahweh your God hear the words of the cupbearer-in-chief whom his master, the king of Assyria,
has sent to insult the living God, and may Yahweh your God punish the words he has heard! Offer your prayer
for the remnant still left’”.

Isa 37:5 When King Hezekiah’s ministers came to Isaiah,

Isa 37:6 he said to them, “Say to your master, ‘Yahweh says this: Do not be afraid of the words which you have
heard or the blasphemies which the king of Assyria’s minions have uttered against me.

Isa 37:7 Look, I am going to put a spirit in him and, on the strength of a rumour, he will go back to his own
country, and in that country I shall make him fall by the sword’”.

Isa 37:8 The cupbearer turned about and rejoined the king of Assyria, who was then attacking Libnah, the
cupbearer having learnt that the king had already left Lachish

Isa 37:9 on hearing that Tirhakah king of Cush was on his way to attack him. Sennacherib again sent
messengers to Hezekiah, saying,

Isa 37:10 “Tell Hezekiah king of Judah this, ‘Do not let your God on whom you are relying deceive you with the
promise: Jerusalem will not fall into the king of Assyria’s clutches.

Isa 37:11 You have learnt by now what the kings of Assyria have done to all the other countries, putting them
under the curse of destruction. Are you likely to be saved?

Isa 37:12 Did the gods of the nations whom my ancestors devastated save them-Gozan, Haran, Rezeph and
the Edenites who were in Tel Basar?

Isa 37:13 Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of Lair, of Sepharvaim, of Hena, of Ivvah?’”.
Isa 37:14 Hezekiah took the letter from the messengers’ hands and read it; he then went up to the Temple of
Yahweh and spread it out before Yahweh.

Isa 37:15 Hezekiah said this prayer in the presence of Yahweh,

Isa 37:16 “Yahweh Sabaoth, God of Israel, enthroned on the winged creatures, you alone are God of all the
kingdoms of the world, you made heaven and earth.

Isa 37:17 Give ear, Yahweh, and listen; open your eyes, Yahweh, and see! Hear the words of Sennacherib, who
has sent to insult the living God.

Isa 37:18 It is true, Yahweh, that the kings of Assyria have destroyed all the nations (and their countries);

Isa 37:19 they have thrown their gods on the fire, for these were not gods but human artefacts — wood and
stone — and hence they have destroyed them.

Isa 37:20 But now, Yahweh our God, save us from his clutches, I beg you, and let all the kingdoms of the world
know that you alone are God, Yahweh”.

Isa 37:21 Isaiah son of Amoz then sent the following message to Hezekiah, “Yahweh, God of Israel, says this,

‘In answer to the prayer which you have addressed to me about Sennacherib king of Assyria.

Isa 37:22 Here is the pronouncement which Yahweh has made about him: She despises you, she scorns you,
the virgin daughter of Zion; she tosses her head at you, the daughter of Jerusalem!

Isa 37:23 Whom have you insulted, whom did you blaspheme? Against whom raised your voice and lifted your
haughty eyes? Against the Holy One of Israel.

Isa 37:24 Through your minions you have insulted the Lord, thinking: With my many chariots I have climbed the
mountain-tops, the utmost peaks of Lebanon. I have felled its mighty cedars, its finest cypresses, have reached
its furthest peak, its forest garden.

Isa 37:25 Yes, I have dug and drunk of foreign waters; under the soles of my feet I have dried up all Egypt’s
rivers.

Isa 37:26 Do you hear? Long ago I prepared this, from days of old I actually planned it, now I carry it out. You
were to lay walled cities in heaps of ruins;

Isa 37:27 that was why their inhabitants, feeble of hand, were dismayed and discomfited, were weak as grass,
were frail as plants, were like grass of housetop and meadow under the east wind.



Isa 37:28 But whether you stand up or sit down, whether you go out or come in, I know it (and how you rave
against me).

Isa 37:29 Because you have raved against me and your arrogance has reached my ears, I shall put a hook
through your nostrils and a muzzle on your lips, and make you return by the road by which you came.

Isa 37:30 And this will be the sign for you: This year will be eaten the self-sown grain, next year what sprouts in
the fallow; but in the third year sow and reap, plant vineyards and eat their fruit.

Isa 37:31 The surviving remnant of the House of Judah will bring forth new roots below and fruits above;

Isa 37:32 for a remnant will issue from Jerusalem, and survivors from Mount Zion. Yahweh Sabaoth’s jealous
love will accomplish this’. 1

Isa 37:33 “This, then, is what Yahweh says about the king of Assyria: He will not enter this city, will shoot no
arrow at it, confront it with no shield, throw up no earthwork against it.

Isa 37:34 By the road by which he came, by that he will return; he will not enter this city, declares Yahweh.

Isa 37:35 I shall protect this city and save it for my sake and my servant David’s sake”.

Isa 37:36 That same night the angel of Yahweh went out and struck down a hundred and eighty-five thousand
men in the Assyrian camp. In the early morning when it was time to get up, there they lay, so many corpses.

Isa 37:37 Sennacherib struck camp and left; he returned home and stayed in Nineveh.

Isa 37:38 One day when he was worshipping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and
Sharezer struck him down with the sword and escaped into the territory of Ararat. His son Esarhaddon
succeeded him.

Isa 38:1 About then, Hezekiah fell ill and was at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz came and
said to him, “Yahweh says this, ‘Put your affairs in order, for you are going to die, you will not live’”.

Isa 38:2 Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and addressed this prayer to Yahweh,

Isa 38:3 “Ah, Yahweh, remember, I beg you, that I have behaved faithfully and with sincerity of heart in your
presence and done what you regard as right”. And Hezekiah shed many tears.

Isa 38:4 Then the word of Yahweh came to Isaiah,

Isa 38:5 “Go and say to Hezekiah, ‘Yahweh, the God of your ancestor David, says this: I have heard your prayer
and seen your tears. I shall cure you: in three days’ time you will go up to the Temple of Yahweh. I shall add
fifteen years to your life.

Isa 38:6 I shall save you and this city from the king of Assyria’s clutches and defend this city for my sake and my
servant David’s sake’. ’

Isa 38:7 “Here”, Isaiah replied, “is the sign from Yahweh that he will do what he has said.

Isa 38:8 Look, I shall make the shadow cast by the declining sun on the steps — the steps to Ahaz’s roof-room-
go back ten steps”. And the sun went back the ten steps by which it had declined.

Isa 38:9 Canticle of Hezekiah king of Judah after his illness and recovery.

Isa 38:10 I thought: In the noon of my life I am to depart. At the gates of Sheol I shall be held for the rest of my

days.

Isa 38:1 1 I thought: I shall never see Yahweh again in the land of the living, I shall never see again a single one
of those who live on earth.

Isa 38:12 My home has been pulled up, and thrown away like a shepherd’s tent; like a weaver, I have rolled up

my life, he has cut me from the loom. From dawn to dark, you have been making an end of me;

Isa 38:13 till daybreak, I cried for help; like a lion, he has crushed all my bones, from dawn to dark, you have
been making an end of me.

Isa 38:14 I twitter like a swallow, I moan like a dove, my eyes have grown dim from looking up. Lord, I am
overwhelmed, come to my help.

Isa 38:15 How can I speak and what can I say to him? He is the one to act. I must eke out the rest of my years
in bitterness of soul.

Isa 38:16 The Lord is over them; they live, and everything in them lives by his spirit. You will cure me. Restore
me to life.

Isa 38:17 At once, my bitterness turns to well-being. For you have preserved my soul from the pit of
nothingness, you have thrust all my sins behind you.

Isa 38:18 For Sheol cannot praise you, nor Death celebrate you; those who go down to the pit can hope no
longer in your constancy.

Isa 38:19 The living, the living are the ones who praise you, as I do today. Fathers tell their sons about your
constancy.

Isa 38:20 Yahweh, come to my help and we will make our harps resound all the days of our life in the Temple of
Yahweh.

Isa 38:21 “Bring a fig poultice”, Isaiah said, “apply it to the ulcer and he will recover”.

Isa 38:22 Hezekiah said, “What is the sign to tell me that I shall be going up to the Temple of Yahweh?”.

Isa 39:1 At that time, the king of Babylon, Merodach-Baladan son of Baladan, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah,



for he had heard of his illness and his recovery.

Isa 39:2 Hezekiah was delighted at this and showed the ambassadors his entire treasury, the silver, gold,
spices, precious oil, his armoury too, and everything to be seen in his storehouses. There was nothing in his
palace or in his whole domain that Hezekiah did not show them.

Isa 39:3 The prophet Isaiah then came to King Hezekiah and asked him, “What have these men said, and where
have they come to you from?”. Hezekiah answered, “They have come from a distant country, from Babylon”.

Isa 39:4 Isaiah said, “What have they seen in your palace?”. “They have seen everything in my palace”, Hezekiah
answered. “There is nothing in my storehouses that I have not shown them”.

Isa 39:5 Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Listen to the word of Yahweh Sabaoth,

Isa 39:6 ‘The days are coming when everything in your palace, everything that your ancestors have amassed
until now, will be carried off to Babylon. Not a thing will be left’, Yahweh says.

Isa 39:7 ‘Sons sprung from you, sons begotten by you, will be abducted to be eunuchs in the palace of the king
of Babylon’”.

Isa 39:8 Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “This word of Yahweh that you announce is reässuring”, for he was thinking,
“There is going to be peace and security during my lifetime”.

Isa 40:1 “Console my people, console them”, says your God.

Isa 40:2 “Speak to the heart of Jerusalem and cry to her that her period of service is ended, that her guilt has
been atoned for, that, from the hand of Yahweh, she has received double punishment for all her sins”.

Isa 40:3 A voice cries, “Prepare in the desert a way for Yahweh. Make a straight highway for our God across the
wastelands.

Isa 40:4 Let every valley be filled in, every mountain and hill be levelled, every cliff become a plateau, every
escarpment a plain;

Isa 40:5 then the glory of Yahweh will be revealed and all humanity will see it together, for the mouth of Yahweh
has spoken”.

Isa 40:6 A voice said, “Cry aloud!”. and I said, “What shall I cry?”. -'All humanity is grass and all its beauty like the
wild flower’s.

Isa 40:7 The grass withers, the flower fades when the breath of Yahweh blows on them. (The grass is surely the
people.)

Isa 40:8 The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God remains for ever”.

Isa 40:9 Go up on a high mountain, messenger of Zion. Shout as loud as you can, messenger of Jerusalem!
Shout fearlessly, say to the towns of Judah, “Here is your God”.

Isa 40:10 Here is Lord Yahweh coming with power, his arm maintains his authority, his reward is with him and
his prize precedes him.

Isa 40:1 1 He is like a shepherd feeding his flock, gathering lambs in his arms, holding them against his breast
and leading to their rest the mother ewes.

Isa 40:12 Who was it measured the water of the sea in the hollow of his hand and calculated the heavens to the
nearest inch, gauged the dust of the earth to the nearest bushel, weighed the mountains in scales, the hills in a
balance?

Isa 40:13 Who directed the spirit of Yahweh, what counsellor could have instructed him?

Isa 40:14 Whom has he consulted to enlighten him, to instruct him in the path of judgement, to teach him
knowledge and show him how to understand?

Isa 40:15 See, the nations are like a drop in a bucket, they count as a grain of dust on the scales. See, coasts
and islands weigh no more than fine powder.

Isa 40:16 The Lebanon is not enough for the burning fires nor its animals enough for the burnt offering.

Isa 40:17 All the nations are as nothing before him, for him they count as nothingness and emptiness.

Isa 40:18 To whom can you compare God? What image can you contrive of him?

Isa 40:19 The craftsman casts an idol, a goldsmith overlays it with gold and casts silver chains for it.

Isa 40:20 Someöne too poor to afford a sacrifice chooses a piece of wood that will not rot; he then seeks out a
skilled craftsman to set up an idol that will not totter.

Isa 40:21 Did you not know, had you not heard? Was it not told you from the beginning? Have you not
understood how the earth was set on its foundations?

Isa 40:22 He who sits enthroned above the circle of the earth, the inhabitants of which are like grasshoppers,
stretches out the heavens like a cloth, spreads them out like a tent to live in.

Isa 40:23 He reduces princes to nothing, the rulers of the world to mere emptiness.

Isa 40:24 Scarcely are they planted, scarcely sown, scarcely has their stem taken root in the soil, than he blows
on them and they wither and the storm carries them away like chaff.

Isa 40:25 “To whom can you compare me, or who is my equal?”. says the Holy One.

Isa 40:26 Lift your eyes and look: he who created these things leads out their army in order, summoning each of
them by name. So mighty is his power, so great his strength, that not one fails to answer.



Isa 40:27 How can you say, Jacob, how can you repeat, Israel, “My way is hidden from Yahweh, my rights are
ignored by my God'?

Isa 40:28 Did you not know? Had you not heard? Yahweh is the everlasting God, he created the remotest parts
of the earth. He does not grow tired or weary, his understanding is beyond fathoming.

Isa 40:29 He gives strength to the weary, he strengthens the powerless.

Isa 40:30 Youths grow tired and weary, the young stumble and fall,

Isa 40:31 but those who hope in Yahweh will regain their strength, they will sprout wings like eagles, though
they run they will not grow weary, though they walk they will never tire.

Isa 41:1 Coasts and islands, fall silent before me, and let the peoples renew their strength, let them come
forward and speak; let us assemble for judgement.

Isa 41 :2 “Who has raised from the east him whom saving justice summons in its train, him to whom Yahweh
delivers up the nations and subjects kings, him who reduces them to dust with his sword, and to driven stubble
with his bow,

Isa 41 :3 him who pursues them and advances unhindered, his feet scarcely touching the road?

Isa 41 :4 Who has acted thus, who has done this? He who calls each generation from the beginning: I, Yahweh,
who am the first and till the last I shall still be there”.

Isa 41 :5 The coasts and islands have seen and taken fright, the remotest parts of earth are trembling: they are
approaching, they are here!

Isa 41 :6 People help one another, they say to each other, “Take heart!”.

Isa 41 :7 The woodworker encourages the smelter, the polisher encourages the hammerer, saying of the
soldering, “It is sound”; and he fastens it with nails to keep it steady.

Isa 41 :8 But you, Israel, my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, descendant of Abraham my friend,

Isa 41:9 whom I have taken to myself, from the remotest parts of the earth and summoned from countries far
away, to whom I have said, “You are my servant, I have chosen you, I have not rejected you”,

Isa 41:10 do not be afraid, for I am with you; do not be alarmed, for I am your God. I give you strength, truly I
help you, truly I hold you firm with my saving right hand.

Isa 41:11 Look, all those who rage against you will be put to shame and humiliated; those who picked quarrels
with you will be reduced to nothing and will perish.

Isa 41:12 You will look for them but will not find them, those who used to fight you; they will be destroyed and
brought to nothing, those who made war on you.

Isa 41:13 For I, Yahweh, your God, I grasp you by your right hand; I tell you, “Do not be afraid, I shall help you”.
Isa 41:14 Do not be afraid, Jacob, you worm! You little handful of Israel! I shall help you, declares Yahweh; your
redeemer is the Holy One of Israel.

Isa 41:15 Look, I am making you into a threshing-sledge, new, with double teeth; you will thresh and beat the
mountains to dust and reduce the hills to straw.

Isa 41:16 You will winnow them and the wind will carry them off, the gale will scatter them; whereäs you will
rejoice in Yahweh, will glory in the Holy One of Israel.

Isa 41:17 The oppressed and needy search for water, and there is none, their tongue is parched with thirst. I,
Yahweh, shall answer them, I, the God of Israel, shall not abandon them.

Isa 41:18 I shall open up rivers on barren heights and water-holes down in the ravines; I shall turn the desert
into a lake and dry ground into springs of water.

Isa 41:19 I shall plant the desert with cedar trees, acacias, myrtles and olives; in the wastelands I shall put
cypress trees, plane trees and box trees side by side;

Isa 41 :20 so that people may see and know, so that they may all observe and understand that the hand of
Yahweh has done this, that the Holy One of Israel has created it.

Isa 41 :21 “Present your case”, says Yahweh, “Produce your arguments”, says Jacob’s king.

Isa 41 :22 “Let them produce and reveal to us what is going to happen. What happened in the past? Reveal it so
that we can consider it and know what the outcome will be. Or tell us about the future,

Isa 41 :23 reveal what is to happen next, and then we shall know that you are gods. At least, do something, be it
good or bad, so that we may feel alarm and fear.

Isa 41:24 Look, you are less than nothingness, and what you do is less than nothing; to choose you is an
outrage”.

Isa 41:25 I have raised him from the north and he has come, from the east he has been summoned by name.

He tramples on rulers like mud, like a potter treading clay.

Isa 41 :26 Who revealed this from the beginning for us to know, and in the past for us to say, “That is right'? No
one in fact revealed it, no one proclaimed it, no one has heard you speak.

Isa 41 .21 First-fruits of Zion, look, here they come! I send a messenger to Jerusalem,

Isa 41 :28 and I look — no one, not a single counsellor among them who, if I asked, could give an answer.

Isa 41 :29 Taken altogether they are nothingness, what they do is nothing, their statues, wind and emptiness.



Isa 42:1 Here is my servant whom I uphold, my chosen one in whom my soul delights. I have sent my spirit
upon him, he will bring fair judgement to the nations.

Isa 42:2 He does not cry out or raise his voice, his voice is not heard in the street;

Isa 42:3 he does not break the crushed reed or snuff the faltering wick. Faithfully he presents fair judgement;

Isa 42:4 he will not grow faint, he will not be crushed until he has established fair judgement on earth, and the
coasts and islands are waiting for his instruction.

Isa 42:5 Thus says God, Yahweh, who created the heavens and spread them out, who hammered into shape
the earth and what comes from it, who gave breath to the people on it, and spirit to those who walk on it:

Isa 42:6 I, Yahweh, have called you in saving justice, I have grasped you by the hand and shaped you; I have
made you a covenant of the people and light to the nations,

Isa 42:7 to open the eyes of the blind, to free captives from prison, and those who live in darkness from the
dungeon.

Isa 42:8 I am Yahweh, that is my name! I shall not yield my glory to another, nor my honour to idols.

Isa 42:9 See how the former predictions have come true. Fresh things I now reveal; before they appear I tell you

of them.

Isa 42:10 Sing a new song to Yahweh! Let his praise be sung from remotest parts of the earth by those who sail
the sea and by everything in it, by the coasts and islands and those who inhabit them.

Isa 42:1 1 Let the desert and its cities raise their voices, the encampments where Kedar lives. Let the inhabitants
of the Rock cry aloud for joy and shout from the mountain tops.

Isa 42:12 Let them give glory to Yahweh and, in the coasts and islands, let them voice his praise.

Isa 42:13 Yahweh advances like a hero, like a warrior he rouses his fire. He shouts, he raises the war cry, he
shows his might against his foes.

Isa 42:14 “From long ago I have been silent, I have kept quiet, held myself in check, groaning like a woman in
labour, panting and gasping for air.

Isa 42:15 I shall ravage mountain and hill, shall wither all their vegetation; I shall turn the torrents into firm
ground and dry up the marshes.

Isa 42:16 I shall lead the blind by a road they do not know, by paths they do not know I shall conduct them. I
shall turn the darkness into light before them and the quagmires into solid ground. This I shall do — without fail”.
Isa 42:17 Those who trust in idols will recoil, they will blush for shame, who say to metal images, “You are our
gods”.

Isa 42:18 Listen, you deaf! Look and see, you blind!

Isa 42:19 Who so blind as my servant, so deaf as the messenger I send? (Who so blind as the friend I have
taken to myself, so deaf as Yahweh’s servant?)

Isa 42:20 You have seen many things but not observed them; your ears are open but you do not hear.

Isa 42:21 Yahweh wished, because of his saving justice, to make the Law great and glorious.

Isa 42:22 Yet here is a people pillaged and plundered, all of them shut up in caves, imprisoned in dungeons.
They have been pillaged, with no one to rescue them, plundered, with no one to say, “Give it back!”.

Isa 42:23 Which of you will listen to this, who pay attention and listen in future?

Isa 42:24 Who surrendered Jacob to the plunderer and Israel to the pillagers? Was it not Yahweh, against
whom we had sinned, in whose ways they would not walk and whose Law they would not obey?

Isa 42:25 On him he poured out his blazing anger and the fury of war; it enveloped him in flames and yet he did
not understand; it burned him up, but he did not learn a lesson.

Isa 43:1 And now, thus says Yahweh, he who created you, Jacob, who formed you, Israel: Do not be afraid, for I
have redeemed you; I have called you by your name, you are mine.

Isa 43:2 Should you pass through the waters, I shall be with you; or through rivers, they will not swallow you up.
Should you walk through fire, you will not suffer, and the flame will not burn you.

Isa 43:3 For I am Yahweh, your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Saviour. I have given Egypt for your ransom,
Cush and Seba in exchange for you.

Isa 43:4 Since I regard you as precious, since you are honoured and I love you, I therefore give people in
exchange for you, and nations in return for your life.

Isa 43:5 Do not be afraid, for I am with you. I shall bring your offspring from the east, and gather you from the
west.

Isa 43:6 To the north I shall say, “Give them up!”. and to the south, “Do not hold them back!”. Bring back my sons
from far away, and my daughters from the remotest part of the earth,

Isa 43:7 everyone who bears my name, whom I have created for my glory, whom I have formed, whom I have
made.

Isa 43:8 Bring forward the people that is blind, yet has eyes, that is deaf and yet has ears.

Isa 43:9 Let all the nations assemble, let the peoples gather here! Which of them has proclaimed this and
revealed things to us in the past? Let them bring their witnesses to justify themselves, let others hear and say, “It



is true”.

Isa 43:10 You yourselves are my witnesses, declares Yahweh, and the servant whom I have chosen, so that
you may know and believe me and understand that it is I. No god was formed before me, nor will be after me.

Isa 43:1 1 I, I am Yahweh, and there is no other Saviour but me.

Isa 43:12 I have revealed, have saved, and have proclaimed, not some foreigner among you. You are my
witnesses, declares Yahweh, I am God,

Isa 43:13 yes, from eternity I am. No one can deliver from my hand; when I act, who can thwart me?

Isa 43:14 Thus says Yahweh, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: For your sake I have sent to Babylon, I
shall knock down all the prison bars, and the Chaldaeans’ shouts of joy will change to lamentations.

Isa 43:15 I am Yahweh, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your king.

Isa 43:16 Thus says Yahweh, who made a way through the sea, a path in the raging waters,

Isa 43:17 who led out chariot and horse together with an army of picked troops: they lay down never to rise
again, they were snuffed out, put out like a wick.

Isa 43:18 No need to remember past events, no need to think about what was done before.

Isa 43:19 Look, I am doing something new, now it emerges; can you not see it? Yes, I am making a road in the
desert and rivers in wastelands.

Isa 43:20 The wild animals will honour me, the jackals and the ostriches, for bestowing water in the desert and
rivers on the wastelands for my people, my chosen one, to drink.

Isa 43:21 The people I have shaped for myself will broadcast my praises.

Isa 43:22 But, Jacob, you have not invoked me; no, Israel, you have grown weary of me.

Isa 43:23 You have not brought me lambs as your burnt offerings and have not honoured me with your
sacrifices. I have not subjected you to cereal offering, I have not wearied you by demanding incense.

Isa 43:24 You have not bought expensive reed for me or sated me with the fat of your sacrifices. Instead by
your sins you have trected me like a slave, you have wearied me with your crimes,

Isa 43:25 I, I it is who blot out your acts of revolt for my own sake and shall not call your sins to mind.

Isa 43:26 Remind me, and we will judge this together; state your own case and justify yourself.

Isa 43:27 Your first ancestor sinned, your interpreters revolted against me.

Isa 43:28 That is why I deposed the chief men of my sanctuary, why I put Jacob under the curse of destruction
and subjected Israel to insult.

Isa 44:1 And now listen, Jacob my servant, Israel whom I have chosen.

Isa 44:2 Thus says Yahweh who made you, who formed you in the womb; he will help you. Do not be afraid,
Jacob my servant, Jeshurun whom I have chosen.

Isa 44:3 For I shall pour out water on the thirsty soil and streams on the dry ground. I shall pour out my spirit on
your descendants, my blessing on your offspring,

Isa 44:4 and they will spring up among the grass, like willows on the banks of a stream.

Isa 44:5 One person will say, “I belong to Yahweh”, another will call himself by Jacob’s name. On his hand
another will write ‘Yahweh’s’ and be surnamed ‘Israel’.

Isa 44:6 Thus says Yahweh, Israel’s king, Yahweh Sabaoth, his redeemer: I am the first and I am the last; there
is no God except me.

Isa 44:7 Who is like me? Let him call out, let him affirm it and convince me it is so; let him say what has been
happening since I instituted an eternal people, and predict to them what will happen next!

Isa 44:8 Have no fear, do not be afraid: have I not told you and revealed it long ago? You are my witnesses. Is
there any God except me? There is no Rock; I know of none.

Isa 44:9 The makers of idols are all nothingness; the works they delight in serve no purpose. And these are the
witness against them: they see nothing, they know nothing; and so they will be put to shame.

Isa 44:10 Who ever fashioned a god or cast an image without hope of gain?

Isa 44:1 1 Watch how all its devotees will be put to shame, and the men who made it too, who are only human.
Let them all assemble, let them stand forward and feel both fear and shame!

Isa 44:12 The blacksmith makes an axe over the charcoal, beats it into shape with a hammer, works on it with
his strong arm. Then he feels hungry and his strength deserts him; having drunk no water, he is exhausted.

Isa 44:13 The wood carver takes his measurements, outlines the image with chalk, executes it with the chisel,
following the outline with a compass. He makes it look like a human being, with human standards of beauty, so
that it can reside in a house.

Isa 44:14 He has cut down cedars, has selected an oak and a terebinth which he has grown for himself among
the trees in the forest and has planted a pine tree which the rain has nourished.

Isa 44:15 Once it is suitable to burn, he takes some of it to warm himself; having kindled it, he bakes bread. But
he also makes a god and worships it; he makes an idol from it and bows down before it.

Isa 44:16 Half of it he burns on the fire, over this half he roasts meat, eats it and is replete; at the same time he
warms himself and says, “Ah, how warm I am, watching the flames!”.



Isa 44:17 With the remainder he makes a god, his idol, bows down before it, worships it and prays to it. “Save
me”, he says, “for you are my god”.

Isa 44:18 They know nothing, they understand nothing, since their eyes are incapable of seeing and their hearts
of reflecting.

Isa 44:19 Not one of them looks into his heart, not one of them has the knowledge and wit to think, “I burned half
of it on the fire and cooked food over the embers. Am I right to make something disgusting out of what is left?

Am I right to bow down before a block of wood?”.

Isa 44:20 He hankers after ashes, his deluded heart has led him astray; he will not save himself, he will not
think, “What I have in my hand is nothing but a lie!”.

Isa 44:21 Remember these things, Jacob, and Israel, since you are my servant. I formed you, you are my
servant; Israel, I shall not forget you.

Isa 44:22 I have dispelled your acts of revolt like a cloud and your sins like a mist. Come back to me, for I have
redeemed you.

Isa 44:23 Heavens, shout for joy, for Yahweh has acted! Underworld, shout aloud! Shout for joy, you mountains,
forests and all your trees! For Yahweh has redeemed Jacob and displayed his glory in Israel.

Isa 44:24 Thus says Yahweh, your redeemer, he who formed you in the womb: I, Yahweh, have made all
things, I alone spread out the heavens. When I hammered the earth into shape, who was with me?

Isa 44:25 I, who foil the omens of soothsayers and make fools of diviners, who confound sages turning their
knowledge into folly,

Isa 44:26 who confirm the word of my servant and make the plans of my envoys succeed; who say to
Jerusalem, “You will be inhabited”, and to the towns of Judah, “You will be rebuilt and I shall restore the ruins of
Jerusalem”;

Isa 44:27 who say to the ocean, “Dry up! I shall make your rivers run dry”;

Isa 44:28 who say to Cyrus, “My shepherd”. He will perform my entire will by saying to Jerusalem, “You will be
rebuilt”, and to the Temple, “You will be refounded”.

Isa 45:1 Thus says Yahweh to his anointed one, to Cyrus whom, he says, I have grasped by his right hand, to
make the nations bow before him and to disarm kings, to open gateways before him so that their gates be closed
no more:

Isa 45:2 I myself shall go before you, I shall level the heights, I shall shatter the bronze gateways, I shall smash
the iron bars.

Isa 45:3 I shall give you secret treasures and hidden hoards of wealth, so that you will know that I am Yahweh,
who call you by your name, the God of Israel.

Isa 45:4 It is for the sake of my servant Jacob and of Israel my chosen one, that I have called you by your name,
have given you a title though you do not know me.

Isa 45:5 I am Yahweh, and there is no other, there is no other God except me. Though you do not know me, I
have armed you

Isa 45:6 so that it may be known from east to west that there is no one except me. I am Yahweh, and there is no
other,

Isa 45:7 I form the light and I create the darkness, I make well-being, and I create disaster, I, Yahweh, do all
these things.

Isa 45:8 Rain down, you heavens, from above, and let the clouds pour down saving justice, let the earth open
up and blossom with salvation, and let justice sprout with it; I, Yahweh, have created it!

Isa 45:9 Woe to anyone who argues with his Maker, one earthenware pot among many! Does the clay say to its
potter, “What are you doing? Your work has no hands!”.

Isa 45:10 Woe to anyone who asks a father, “Why are you begetting?”. and a woman, “Why are you giving birth?”.
Isa 45:1 1 Thus says Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel and his Maker: I am asked for signs regarding my sons, I
am given orders about the work I do.

Isa 45:12 It was I who made the earth and I created human beings on it, mine were the hands that spread out
the heavens and I have given the orders to all their array.

Isa 45:13 I myself have raised him in saving justice and I shall make all paths level for him. He will rebuild my
city and bring my exiles home without ransom or indemnity, says Yahweh Sabaoth.

Isa 45:14 Thus says Yahweh: The produce of Egypt, the commerce of Cush and the men of Seba, tall of
stature, will come over to you and belong to you. They will follow you, walking in chains, they will bow before
you, they will pray to you, “With you alone is God, and there is no other! The gods do not exist”.

Isa 45:15 Truly, you are a God who conceals himself, God of Israel, Saviour!

Isa 45:16 They are shamed and humbled, every one of them, humiliated they go, the makers of idols.

Isa 45:17 Israel will be saved by Yahweh, saved everlastingly. You will never be ashamed or humiliated for ever
and ever.

Isa 45:18 For thus says Yahweh, the Creator of the heavens — he is God, who shaped the earth and made it,



who set it firm; he did not create it to be chaos, he formed it to be lived in: I am Yahweh, and there is no other.

Isa 45:19 I have not spoken in secret, in some dark corner of the underworld. I did not say, “Offspring of Jacob,
search for me in chaos!”. I am Yahweh: I proclaim saving justice, I say what is true.

Isa 45:20 Assemble, come, all of you gather round, survivors of the nations. They have no knowledge, those
who parade their wooden idols and pray to a god that cannot save.

Isa 45:21 Speak up, present your case, let them put their heads together! Who foretold this in the past, who
revealed it long ago? Was it not I, Yahweh? There is no other god except me, no saving God, no Saviour except
me!

Isa 45:22 Turn to me and you will be saved, all you ends of the earth, for I am God, and there is no other.

Isa 45:23 By my own self I swear it; what comes from my mouth is saving justice, it is an irrevocable word: All
shall bend the knee to me, by me every tongue shall swear,

Isa 45:24 saying, “In Yahweh alone are saving justice and strength”, until all those who used to rage at him come
to him in shame.

Isa 45:25 In Yahweh the whole race of Israel finds justice and glory.

Isa 46:1 Bel is crouching, Nebo cowering, their idols are being put on animals, on beasts of burden, the loads
you have been carrying are a burden to a weary beast.

Isa 46:2 They are cowering and crouching together, no one can save this burden, they themselves have gone
into captivity.

Isa 46:3 Listen to me, House of Jacob, all who remain of the House of Israel, whom I have carried since the
womb, whom I have supported since you were conceived.

Isa 46:4 Until your old age I shall be the same, until your hair is grey I shall carry you. As I have done, so I shall
support you, I myself shall carry and shall save you.

Isa 46:5 With whom can you compare me, equate me, to whom can you liken me, making equals of us?

Isa 46:6 They lavish gold from their purses and weigh out silver on the scales. They engage a goldsmith to
make a god, then bow low and actually adore!

Isa 46:7 They lift it on their shoulders and carry it, and put it down where it is meant to stand, so that it never
moves from the spot. You may cry out to it in distress, it never replies, it never saves anyone in trouble.

Isa 46:8 Remember this and stand firm; rebels, look into your hearts.

Isa 46:9 Remember the things that happened long ago, for I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there
is none like me.

Isa 46:10 From the beginning I revealed the future, in advance, what has not yet occurred. I say: My purpose
will come about, I shall do whatever I please;

Isa 46:1 1 I call a bird of prey from the east, my man predestined, from a distant land. What I have said, I shall
do, what I have planned, I shall perform.

Isa 46:12 Listen to me, you hard-hearted people far removed from saving justice:

Isa 46:13 I am bringing my justice nearer, it is not far away, my salvation will not delay. I shall place my
salvation in Zion and my glory in Israel.

Isa 47:1 Step down! Sit in the dust, virgin daughter of Babylon. Sit on the ground, no throne, daughter of the
Chaldaeans, for never again will you be called tender and delicate.

Isa 47:2 Take the grinding mill, crush up the meal. Remove your veil, tie up your skirt, bare your legs, cross the
rivers.

Isa 47:3 Let your nakedness be displayed and your shame exposed. I am going to take vengeance and no one
will stand in my way.

Isa 47:4 Our redeemer, Yahweh Sabaoth is his name, the Holy One of Israel, says:

Isa 47:5 Sit in silence, bury yourself in darkness, daughter of the Chaldaeans, for never again will you be called
the mistress of kingdoms.

Isa 47:6 Being angry with my people, I rejected my heritage, surrendering them into your clutches. You showed
them no mercy, you made your yoke very heavy on the aged.

Isa 47:7 You thought, “I shall be a queen for ever”. You did not reflect on these matters or think about the future.
Isa 47:8 Now listen to this, voluptuous woman, lolling at ease and thinking to yourself, “I am the only one who
matters. I shall never be widowed, never know bereavement”.

Isa 47:9 Yet both these things will befall you, suddenly, in one day. Bereavement and widowhood will suddenly
befall you in spite of all your witchcraft and the potency of your spells.

Isa 47:10 Confident in your wickedness, you thought, “No one can see me”. Your wishes and your knowledge
were what deluded you, as you thought to yourself, “I am the only one who matters”.

Isa 47:1 1 Hence, disaster will befall you which you will not know how to charm away, calamity overtake you
which you will not be able to avert, ruination will suddenly befall you, such as you have never known.

Isa 47:12 Keep to your spells then, and all your sorceries, at which you have worked so hard since you were
young. Perhaps you will succeed, perhaps you will strike terror!



Isa 47:13 You have had many tiring consultations: let the astrologers come forward now and save you, the star-
gazers who announce month by month what will happen to you next.

Isa 47:14 Look, they are like wisps of straw, the fire will burn them up. They will not save their lives from the
power of the flame. No embers these, for keeping warm, no fire to sit beside!

Isa 47:15 Such will your wizards prove to be for you, for whom you have worked so hard since you were young;
each wandering his own way, none of them can save you.

Isa 48:1 Listen to this, House of Jacob, you who are called by the name of Israel and issued from the waters of
Judah, who swear by the name of Yahweh and invoke the God of Israel, though not in good faith or uprightness;
Isa 48:2 for they call themselves after the holy city and rely on the God of Israel, Yahweh Sabaoth is his name.
Isa 48:3 Things now past I revealed long ago, they issued from my mouth, I proclaimed them; suddenly I acted
and they happened.

Isa 48:4 For I knew you to be obstinate, your neck an iron sinew and your forehead bronze.

Isa 48:5 As I told you about it long before, before it happened I revealed it to you, so that you could not say, “My
statue did it, my idol, my metal image, ordained this”.

Isa 48:6 You have heard and seen all this, why won’t you admit it? Now I am going to reveal new things to you,
secrets that you do not know;

Isa 48:7 they have just been created, not long ago, and until today you have heard nothing about them, so that
you cannot say, “Yes, I knew about this”.

Isa 48:8 No, you have not heard, you have not known, for a long time your ear has not been attentive, for I knew
how treacherous you were; you have been called a rebel since the womb.

Isa 48:9 For the sake of my name I shall defer my anger, for the sake of my honour I shall be patient with you,
rather than destroy you.

Isa 48:10 Look, I have purchased you, but not for silver, I have chosen you out of the cauldron of affliction.

Isa 48:1 1 For my sake and my sake only shall I act, for why should my name be profaned? I will not yield my
glory to another.

Isa 48:12 Listen to me, Jacob, Israel whom I have called: I, and none else, am the first, I am also the last.

Isa 48:13 My hand laid the foundations of earth and my right hand spread out the heavens. I summon them and
they all present themselves together.

Isa 48:14 Assemble, all of you, and listen; which of them has revealed this? Yahweh loves him; he will do his
pleasure on Babylon and the race of the Chaldaeans;

Isa 48:15 I, I have spoken, yes, I have summoned him, I have brought him, and he will succeed.

Isa 48:16 Come near and listen to this: from the first, I never spoke obscurely; when it happened, I was there,
and now Lord Yahweh has sent me with his spirit.

Isa 48:17 Thus says Yahweh, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I am Yahweh your God and teach you for
your own good, I lead you in the way you ought to go.

Isa 48:18 If only you had listened to my commandments! Your prosperity would have been like a river and your
saving justice like the waves of the sea.

Isa 48:19 Your descendants would have been numbered like the sand, your offspring as many as its grains.
Their name would never be cancelled or blotted out from my presence.

Isa 48:20 Come out from Babylon! Flee from the Chaldaeans! Declare this with cries of joy, proclaim it, carry it
to the remotest parts of earth, say, “Yahweh has redeemed his servant Jacob”.

Isa 48:21 Those he led through the arid country never went thirsty; he made water flow for them from the rock,
he split the rock and out streamed the water.

Isa 48:22 There is no peace, says Yahweh, for the wicked.

Isa 49:1 Coasts and islands, listen to me, pay attention, distant peoples. Yahweh called me when I was in the
womb, before my birth he had pronounced my name.

Isa 49:2 He made my mouth like a sharp sword, he hid me in the shadow of his hand. He made me into a
sharpened arrow and concealed me in his quiver.

Isa 49:3 He said to me, “Israel, you are my servant, through whom I shall manifest my glory”.

Isa 49:4 But I said, “My toil has been futile, I have exhausted myself for nothing, to no purpose”. Yet all the while
my cause was with Yahweh and my reward with my God.

Isa 49:5 And now Yahweh has spoken, who formed me in the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob back to
him and to re-unite Israel to him;-l shall be honoured in Yahweh’s eyes, and my God has been my strength. -
Isa 49:6 He said, “It is not enough for you to be my servant, to restore the tribes of Jacob and bring back the
survivors of Israel; I shall make you a light to the nations so that my salvation may reach the remotest parts of
earth”.

Isa 49:7 Thus says Yahweh, the redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, to the one who is despised, detested by the
nation, to the slave of despots: Kings will stand up when they see, princes will see and bow low, because of
Yahweh who is faithful, the Holy One of Israel who has chosen you.



Isa 49:8 Thus says Yahweh: At the time of my favour I have answered you, on the day of salvation I have
helped you. I have formed you and have appointed you to be the covenant for a people, to restore the land, to
return ravaged properties,

Isa 49:9 to say to prisoners, “Come out”, to those who are in darkness, “Show yourselves”. Along the roadway
they will graze, and any bare height will be their pasture.

Isa 49:10 They will never hunger or thirst, scorching wind and sun will never plague them; for he who pities
them will lead them, will guide them to springs of water.

Isa 49:1 1 I shall turn all my mountains into a road and my highways will be raised aloft.

Isa 49:12 Look! Here they come from far away, look, these from the north and the west, those from the land of
Sinim.

Isa 49:13 Shout for joy, you heavens; earth, exult! Mountains, break into joyful cries! For Yahweh has consoled
his people, is taking pity on his afflicted ones.

Isa 49:14 Zion was saying, “Yahweh has abandoned me, the Lord has forgotten me”.

Isa 49:15 Can a woman forget her baby at the breast, feel no pity for the child she has borne? Even if these
were to forget, I shall not forget you.

Isa 49:16 Look, I have engraved you on the palms of my hands, your ramparts are ever before me.

Isa 49:17 Your rebuilders are hurrying, your destroyers and despoilers will soon go away.

Isa 49:18 Raise your eyes and look around you: all are assembling, coming to you. By my life, declares
Yahweh, you will put them all on like jewels, like a bride, you will fasten them on.

Isa 49:19 For your desolate places and your ruins and your devastated country from now on will be too cramped
for your inhabitants, and your devourers will be far away.

Isa 49:20 Once more they will say in your hearing, the children of whom you were bereft, “The place is too
cramped for me, make room for me to live”.

Isa 49:21 Then you will think to yourself, “Who has borne me these? I was bereft and barren, exiled, turned out
of my home; who has reared these? I was left all alone, so where have these come from?”.

Isa 49:22 Thus says Lord Yahweh: Look, I am beckoning to the nations and hoisting a signal to the peoples:
they will bring your sons in their arms and your daughters will be carried on their shoulders.

Isa 49:23 Kings will be your foster-fathers and their princesses, your foster-mothers. They will fall prostrate
before you, faces to the ground, and lick the dust at your feet. And you will know that I am Yahweh; those who
hope in me will not be disappointed.

Isa 49:24 Can the body be snatched from the warrior, can the tyrant’s captive be set free?

Isa 49:25 But thus says Yahweh: The warrior’s captive will indeed be snatched away and the tyrant’s booty will
indeed be set free; I myself shall fight those who fight you and I myself shall save your children.

Isa 49:26 I shall make your oppressors eat their own flesh, they will be as drunk on their own blood as on new
wine. And all humanity will know that I am Yahweh, your Saviour, your redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.

Isa 50:1 Thus says Yahweh: Where is your mother’s writ of divorce by which I repudiated her? Or to which of
my creditors have I sold you? Look, you have been sold for your own misdeeds, your mother was repudiated for
your acts of rebellion.

Isa 50:2 Why was there no one there when I came? Why did no one answer when I called? Is my hand too short
to redeem? Have I not strength to save? Look, with a threat I can dry the sea, and turn rivers to desert; the fish
in them go rotten for want of water and die of thirst.

Isa 50:3 I dress the heavens in black, I cover them in sackcloth.

Isa 50:4 Lord Yahweh has given me a disciple’s tongue, for me to know how to give a word of comfort to the
weary. Morning by morning he makes my ear alert to listen like a disciple.

Isa 50:5 Lord Yahweh has opened my ear and I have not resisted, I have not turned away.

Isa 50:6 I have offered my back to those who struck me, my cheeks to those who plucked my beard; I have not
turned my face away from insult and spitting.

Isa 50:7 Lord Yahweh comes to my help, this is why insult has not touched me, this is why I have set my face
like flint and know that I shall not be put to shame.

Isa 50:8 He who grants me saving justice is near! Who will bring a case against me? Let us appear in court
together! Who has a case against me? Let him approach me!

Isa 50:9 Look, Lord Yahweh is coming to my help! Who dares condemn me? Look at them, all falling apart like
moth-eaten clothes!

Isa 50:10 Which of you fears Yahweh and listens to his servant’s voice? Which of you walks in darkness and
sees no light? Let him trust in the name of Yahweh and lean on his God!

Isa 50:1 1 Look, all you who light a fire and arm yourselves with firebrands, walk by the light of your fire and the
firebrands you have kindled! This is what you will get from me: you will lie down in torment!

Isa 51:1 Listen to me, you who pursue saving justice, you who seek Yahweh. Consider the rock from which you
were hewn, the quarry from which you were dug.



Isa 51 :2 Consider Abraham your father and Sarah who gave you birth. When I called him he was the only one
but I blessed him and made him numerous.

Isa 51 :3 Yes, Yahweh has pity on Zion, has pity on all her ruins; he will turn her desert into an Eden and her
wastelands into the garden of Yahweh. Joy and gladness will be found in her, thanksgiving and the sound of
music.

Isa 51 :4 Pay attention to me, my people, listen to me, my nation, for a law will come from me, and I shall make
my saving justice the light of peoples.

Isa 51 :5 My justice is suddenly approaching, my salvation appears, my arm is about to judge the peoples. The
coasts and islands will put their hope in me and put their trust in my arm.

Isa 51 :6 Raise your eyes to the heavens, look down at the earth; for the heavens will vanish like smoke, the
earth wear out like clothing and its inhabitants die like vermin, but my salvation will last for ever and my saving
justice remain inviolable.

Isa 51 :7 Listen to me, you who know what saving justice means, a people who take my laws to heart: do not
fear people’s taunts, do not be alarmed by their insults,

Isa 51 :8 for the moth will eat them like clothing, the grub will devour them like wool, but my saving justice will
last for ever and my salvation for all generations.

Isa 51 :9 Awake, awake! Clothe yourself in strength, arm of Yahweh. Awake, as in the olden days, generations
long ago! Was it not you who split Rahab in half, who pierced the Dragon through?

Isa 51:10 Was it not you who dried up the sea, the waters of the great Abyss; who made the sea-bed into a road
for the redeemed to go across?

Isa 51:11 This is why those whom Yahweh has ransomed will return, they will enter Zion shouting for joy, their
heads crowned with a joy unending; joy and gladness will escort them and sorrow and sighing will take flight.

Isa 51:12 I, I am your consoler. Why then should you be afraid of mortal human beings, of a child of man, whose
fate is that of the grass?

Isa 51 : 1 3 You forget about Yahweh your Creator who spread out the heavens and laid the earth’s foundations;
you have never stopped trembling all day long before the fury of the oppressor when he was bent on destruction.
Where is the oppressor’s fury now?

Isa 51:14 The despairing captive is soon to be set free; he will not die in the dungeon, nor will his food run out.
Isa 51 :1 5 I am Yahweh your God who stirs up the sea, making its waves roar — Yahweh Sabaoth is my name.
Isa 51 :16 I put my words into your mouth, I hid you in the shadow of my hand, to spread out the heavens and
lay the earth’s foundations and say to Zion, “You are my people”.

Isa 51:17 Awake, awake! To your feet, Jerusalem! You who from Yahweh’s hand have drunk the cup of his
wrath. The chalice, the stupefying cup, you have drained to the dregs.

Isa 51:18 There is no one to guide her of all the children she has borne, no one to grasp her hand of all the
children she has reared.

Isa 51:19 Double disaster has befallen you — who is there to sympathise? Pillage and ruin, famine and sword —
who is there to console you?

Isa 51 :20 Your children are lying helpless at the end of every street like an antelope trapped in a net; they are
filled to the brim with Yahweh’s wrath, with the rebuke of your God.

Isa 51 :21 So listen to this, afflicted one, drunk, though not with wine.

Isa 51 :22 Thus says your Lord Yahweh, your God, defender of your people: Look, I am taking the stupefying
cup from your hand, the chalice, the cup of my wrath, you will not have to drink again.

Isa 51 :23 I shall hand it to your tormentors who used to say to you, “On the ground! So that we can walk over
you!”. And you would flatten your back like the ground, like a street for them to walk on.

Isa 52:1 Awake, awake! Clothe yourself in strength, Zion. Put on your finest clothes, Jerusalem, Holy City; for
the uncircumcised and the unclean will enter you no more.

Isa 52:2 Shake off your dust; get up, captive Jerusalem! The chains have fallen from your neck, captive
daughter of Jerusalem!

Isa 52:3 For Yahweh says this, “You were sold for nothing; you will be redeemed without money”.

Isa 52:4 For the Lord Yahweh says this, “Long ago my people went to Egypt and settled there as aliens; finally
Assyria oppressed them for no reason.

Isa 52:5 So now what is to be done”, declares Yahweh, “since my people have been carried off for nothing, their
masters howl in triumph”, declares Yahweh, “and my name is held in contempt all day, every day?

Isa 52:6 Because of this my people will know my name, because of this they will know when the day comes,
that it is I saying, Here I am!”.

Isa 52:7 How beautiful on the mountains, are the feet of the messenger announcing peace, of the messenger of
good news, who proclaims salvation and says to Zion, “Your God is king!”.

Isa 52:8 The voices of your watchmen! Now they raise their voices, shouting for joy together, for with their own
eyes they have seen Yahweh returning to Zion.



Isa 52:9 Break into shouts together, shouts of joy, you ruins of Jerusalem; for Yahweh has consoled his people,
he has redeemed Jerusalem.

Isa 52:10 Yahweh has bared his holy arm for all the nations to see, and all the ends of the earth have seen the
salvation of our God.

Isa 52:1 1 Go away, go away, leave that place, do not touch anything unclean. Get out of her, purify yourselves,
you who carry Yahweh’s vessels!

Isa 52:12 For you are not to hurry away, you are not to leave like fugitives. No, Yahweh marches at your head
and the God of Israel is your rearguard.

Isa 52:13 Look, my servant will prosper, will grow great, will rise to great heights.

Isa 52:14 As many people were aghast at him — he was so inhumanly disfigured that he no longer looked like a
man-

Isa 52:15 so many nations will be astonished and kings will stay tight-lipped before him, seeing what had never
been told them, learning what they had not heard before.

Isa 53:1 Who has given credence to what we have heard? And who has seen in it a revelation of Yahweh’s
arm?

Isa 53:2 Like a sapling he grew up before him, like a root in arid ground. He had no form or charm to attract us,
no beauty to win our hearts;

Isa 53:3 he was despised, the lowest of men, a man of sorrows, familiar with suffering, one from whom, as it
were, we averted our gaze, despised, for whom we had no regard.

Isa 53:4 Yet ours were the sufferings he was bearing, ours the sorrows he was carrying, while we thought of him
as someöne being punished and struck with affliction by God;

Isa 53:5 whereäs he was being wounded for our rebellions, crushed because of our guilt; the punishment
reconciling us fell on him, and we have been healed by his bruises.

Isa 53:6 We had all gone astray like sheep, each taking his own way, and Yahweh brought the acts of rebellion
of all of us to bear on him.

Isa 53:7 Ill-treated and afflicted, he never opened his mouth, like a lamb led to the slaughter-house, like a sheep
dumb before its shearers he never opened his mouth.

Isa 53:8 Forcibly, after sentence, he was taken. Which of his contemporaries was concerned at his having been
cut off from the land of the living, at his having been struck dead for his people’s rebellion?

Isa 53:9 He was given a grave with the wicked, and his tomb is with the rich, although he had done no violence,
had spoken no deceit.

Isa 53:10 It was Yahweh’s good pleasure to crush him with pain; if he gives his life as a sin offering, he will see
his offspring and prolong his life, and through him Yahweh’s good pleasure will be done.

Isa 53:1 1 After the ordeal he has endured, he will see the light and be content. By his knowledge, the upright
one, my servant will justify many by taking their guilt on himself.

Isa 53:12 Hence I shall give him a portion with the many, and he will share the booty with the mighty, for having
exposed himself to death and for being counted as one of the rebellious, whereäs he was bearing the sin of
many and interceding for the rebellious.

Isa 54:1 Shout for joy, barren one who has borne no children! Break into cries and shouts of joy, you who were
never in labour! For the children of the forsaken one are more in number than the children of the wedded wife,
says Yahweh.

Isa 54:2 Widen the space of your tent, extend the curtains of your home, do not hold back! Lengthen your ropes,
make your tent-pegs firm,

Isa 54:3 for you will burst out to right and to left, your race will dispossess the nations and repopulate deserted
towns.

Isa 54:4 Do not fear, you will not be put to shame again, do not worry, you will not be disgraced again; for you
will forget the shame of your youth and no longer remember the dishonour of your widowhood.

Isa 54:5 For your Creator is your husband, Yahweh Sabaoth is his name, the Holy One of Israel is your
redeemer, he is called God of the whole world.

Isa 54:6 Yes, Yahweh has called you back like a forsaken, grief-stricken wife, like the repudiated wife of his
youth, says your God.

Isa 54:7 I did forsake you for a brief moment, but in great compassion I shall take you back.

Isa 54:8 In a flood of anger, for a moment I hid my face from you. But in everlasting love I have taken pity on
you, says Yahweh, your redeemer.

Isa 54:9 For me it will be as in the days of Noah when I swore that Noah’s waters should never flood the world
again. So now I swear never to be angry with you and never to rebuke you again.

Isa 54:10 For the mountains may go away and the hills may totter, but my faithful love will never leave you, my
covenant of peace will never totter, says Yahweh who takes pity on you.

Isa 54:1 1 Unhappy creature, storm-tossed, unpitied, look, I shall lay your stones on agates and your foundations



on sapphires.

Isa 54:12 I shall make your battlements rubies, your gateways firestone and your entire wall precious stones.

Isa 54:13 All your children will be taught by Yahweh and great will be your children’s prosperity.

Isa 54:14 In saving justice you will be made firm, free from oppression: you will have nothing to fear; free from
terror: it will not approach you.

Isa 54:15 Should anyone attack you, that will not be my doing, and whoëver does attack you, for your sake will
fall.

Isa 54:16 I created the smith who blows on the charcoal-fire to produce a weapon for his use; I also created the
destroyer to ruin it.

Isa 54:17 No weapon forged against you will succeed. Any voice raised against you in court you will refute.

Such is the lot of the servants of Yahweh, the saving justice I assure them, declares Yahweh.

Isa 55:1 Oh, come to the water all you who are thirsty; though you have no money, come! Buy and eat; come,
buy wine and milk without money, free!

Isa 55:2 Why spend money on what cannot nourish and your wages on what fails to satisfy? Listen carefully to
me, and you will have good things to eat and rich food to enjoy.

Isa 55:3 Pay attention, come to me; listen, and you will live. I shall make an everlasting covenant with you in
fulfilment of the favours promised to David.

Isa 55:4 Look, I have made him a witness to peoples, a leader and lawgiver to peoples.

Isa 55:5 Look, you will summon a nation unknown to you, a nation unknown to you will hurry to you for the sake
of Yahweh your God, because the Holy One of Israel has glorified you.

Isa 55:6 Seek out Yahweh while he is still to be found, call to him while he is still near.

Isa 55:7 Let the wicked abandon his way and the evil one his thoughts. Let him turn back to Yahweh who will
take pity on him, to our God, for he is rich in forgiveness;

Isa 55:8 for my thoughts are not your thoughts and your ways are not my ways, declares Yahweh.

Isa 55:9 For the heavens are as high above earth as my ways are above your ways, my thoughts above your
thoughts.

Isa 55:10 For, as the rain and the snow come down from the sky and do not return before having watered the
earth, fertilising it and making it germinate to provide seed for the sower and food to eat,

Isa 55:1 1 so it is with the word that goes from my mouth: it will not return to me unfulfilled or before having
carried out my good pleasure and having achieved what it was sent to do.

Isa 55:12 Yes, you will go out with joy and be led away in safety. Mountains and hills will break into joyful cries
before you and all the trees of the countryside clap their hands.

Isa 55:13 Cypress will grow instead of thorns, myrtle instead of nettles. And this will be fame for Yahweh, an
eternal monument never to be effaced.

Isa 56:1 Thus says Yahweh: Make fair judgement your concern, act with justice, for soon my salvation will come
and my saving justice be manifest.

Isa 56:2 Blessed is anyone who does this, anyone who clings to it, observing the Sabbath, not profaning it, and
abstaining from every evil deed.

Isa 56:3 No foreigner adhering to Yahweh should say, “Yahweh will utterly exclude me from his people”. No
eunuch should say, “Look, I am a dried-up tree”.

Isa 56:4 For Yahweh says this: To the eunuchs who observe my Sabbaths and choose to do my good pleasure
and cling to my covenant,

Isa 56:5 I shall give them in my house and within my walls a monument and a name better than sons and
daughters; I shall give them an everlasting name that will never be effaced.

Isa 56:6 As for foreigners who adhere to Yahweh to serve him, to love Yahweh’s name and become his
servants, all who observe the Sabbath, not profaning it, and cling to my covenant:

Isa 56:7 these I shall lead to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer. Their burnt
offerings and sacrifices will be accepted on my altar, for my house will be called a house of prayer for all
peoples.

Isa 56:8 Lord Yahweh who gathers the exiles of Israel declares: There are others I shall gather besides those
already gathered.

Isa 56:9 Come and gorge, all you wild beasts, all you beasts of the forest!

Isa 56:10 Its watchmen are all blind, they know nothing. Dumb watchdogs all, unable to bark, they dream, lie
down, and love to sleep.

Isa 56:1 1 Greedy dogs, never satisfied, such are the shepherds, who understand nothing; they all go their own
way, each to the last man after his own interest.

Isa 56:12 “Come, let me fetch wine; we will get drunk on strong drink, tomorrow will be just as wonderful as
today and even more so!”.

Isa 57:1 The upright person perishes and no one cares. The faithful is taken off and no one takes it to heart.



Yes, because of the evil times the upright is taken off;

Isa 57:2 he will enter peace, and those who follow the right way will find rest on their beds.

Isa 57:3 But you, you children of a witch, come here, adulterous race prostituting yourselves!

Isa 57:4 At whom are you jeering, at whom are you making faces and sticking out your tongue? Are you not the
spawn of rebellion, a lying race?

Isa 57:5 Lusting among the terebinths, and under every spreading tree, sacrificing children in the ravines, below
the clefts in the rocks.

Isa 57:6 The smooth stones of the ravines will be your portion, yes, these will be your lot. To these you have
poured libations, have brought your cereal offering. Can all this appease me?

Isa 57:7 On a mountain high and lofty you have put your bed. Thither, too, you have climbed to offer sacrifice.
Isa 57:8 Behind door and doorpost you have set your reminder. Yes, far from me, you exposed yourself,
climbed on to your bed, and made the most of it. You struck a profitable bargain with those whose bed you love,
whoring with them often, with your eyes on the sacred symbol.

Isa 57:9 You went to Molech with oil, you were prodigal with your perfumes; you sent your envoys far afield,
down to Sheol itself.

Isa 57:10 Though tired by so much travelling, you never said, “It is no use”. Finding your strength revive, you
never gave up.

Isa 57:1 1 Who was it you dreaded, and feared, that you should betray me, no longer remember me and not
spare a thought for me? Was I not silent for a long time? So you cannot have been afraid of me.

Isa 57:12 Now I shall expose this uprightness of yours, and little good it did you.

Isa 57:13 When you cry for help, let those thronging round you save you! The wind will carry them all away, one
puff will take them off. But whoëver trusts in me will inherit the country, he will own my holy mountain.

Isa 57:14 Then it will be said: Level up, level up, clear the way, remove the obstacle from my people’s way,

Isa 57:15 for thus says the High and Exalted One who lives eternally and whose name is holy, “I live in the holy
heights but I am with the contrite and humble, to revive the spirit of the humble, to revive the heart of the contrite.
Isa 57:16 “For I do not want to be forever accusing nor always to be angry, or the spirit would fail under my
onslaught, the souls that I myself have made.

Isa 57:17 “Angered by his wicked cupidity, I hid and struck him in anger, but he rebelliously went the way of his
choice.

Isa 57:18 “I saw how he behaved, but I shall heal him, I shall lead him, fill him with consolation, him and those
who mourn for him,

Isa 57:19 bringing praise to their lips. Peace, peace to far and near, Yahweh says, and I shall heal him”.

Isa 57:20 The wicked, however, are like the restless sea that cannot be still, whose waters throw up mud and
dirt.

Isa 57:21 “No peace”, says Yahweh, “for the wicked”.

Isa 58:1 Shout for all you are worth, do not hold back, raise your voice like a trumpet. To my people proclaim
their rebellious acts, to the House of Jacob, their sins.

Isa 58:2 They seek for me day after day, they long to know my ways, like a nation that has acted uprightly and
not forsaken the law of its God. They ask me for laws that are upright, they long to be near God:

Isa 58:3 “Why have we fasted, if you do not see, why mortify ourselves if you never notice?”. Look, you seek your
own pleasure on your fastdays and you exploit all your workmen;

Isa 58:4 look, the only purpose of your fasting is to quarrel and squabble and strike viciously with your fist.
Fasting like yours today will never make your voice heard on high.

Isa 58:5 Is that the sort of fast that pleases me, a day when a person inflicts pain on himself? Hanging your
head like a reed, spreading out sackcloth and ashes? Is that what you call fasting, a day acceptable to Yahweh?
Isa 58:6 Is not this the sort of fast that pleases me: to break unjust fetters, to undo the thongs of the yoke, to let
the oppressed go free, and to break all yokes?

Isa 58:7 Is it not sharing your food with the hungry, and sheltering the homeless poor; if you see someöne
lacking clothes, to clothe him, and not to turn away from your own kin?

Isa 58:8 Then your light will blaze out like the dawn and your wound be quickly healed over. Saving justice will
go ahead of you and Yahweh’s glory come behind you.

Isa 58:9 Then you will cry for help and Yahweh will answer; you will call and he will say, “I am here”. If you do
away with the yoke, the clenched fist and malicious words,

Isa 58:10 if you deprive yourself for the hungry and satisfy the needs of the afflicted, your light will rise in the
darkness, and your darkest hour will be like noon.

Isa 58:1 1 Yahweh will always guide you, will satisfy your needs in the scorched land; he will give strength to
your bones and you will be like a watered garden, like a flowing spring whose waters never run dry.

Isa 58:12 Your ancient ruins will be rebuilt; you will build on age — old foundations. You will be called ‘Breach-
mender’, ‘Restorer of streets to be lived in’.



Isa 58:13 If you refrain from breaking the Sabbath, from taking your own pleasure on my holy day, if you call the
Sabbath “Delightful”, and the day sacred to Yahweh “Honourable”, if you honour it by abstaining from travel, from
seeking your own pleasure and from too much talk,

Isa 58:14 then you will find true happiness in Yahweh, and I shall lead you in triumph over the heights of the
land. I shall feed you on the heritage of your father Jacob, for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken.

Isa 59:1 No, the arm of Yahweh is not too short to save, nor his ear too dull to hear,

Isa 59:2 but your guilty deeds have made a gulf between you and your God. Your sins have made him hide his
face from you so as not to hear you,

Isa 59:3 since your hands are stained with blood and your fingers with guilt; your lips utter lies, your tongues
murmur wickedness.

Isa 59:4 No one makes upright accusations or pleads sincerely. All rely on empty words, utter falsehood,
conceive trouble and give birth to evil.

Isa 59:5 They are hatching adders’ eggs and weaving a spider’s web; eat one of their eggs and you die, crush
one and a viper emerges.

Isa 59:6 Their webs are useless for clothing, their deeds are useless for wearing; their deeds are deeds of guilt,
violence fills their hands.

Isa 59:7 Their feet run to do evil; they are quick to shed innocent blood. Their thoughts are thoughts of guilt,
wherever they go there is havoc and ruin.

Isa 59:8 They do not know the way of peace, there is no fair judgement in their course, they have made their
own crooked paths, and no one treading them knows any peace.

Isa 59:9 Thus fair judgement is remote from us nor can uprightness overtake us. We looked for light and all is
darkness, for brightness and we walk in gloom.

Isa 59:10 Like the blind we feel our way along walls, we grope our way like people without eyes. We stumble as
though noon were twilight, among the robust we are like the dead.

Isa 59:1 1 We growl, all of us, like bears, like doves we make no sound but moaning, waiting for the fair
judgement that never comes, for salvation, but that is far away.

Isa 59:12 How often we have rebelled against you and our sins bear witness against us. Our rebellious acts are
indeed with us, we are well aware of our guilt:

Isa 59:13 rebellion and denial of Yahweh, turning our back on our God, talking violence and revolt, murmuring
lies in our heart.

Isa 59:14 Fair judgement is driven away and saving justice stands aloof, for good faith has stumbled in the
street and sincerity cannot enter.

Isa 59:15 Good faith has vanished; anyone abstaining from evil is victimised. Yahweh saw this and was
displeased that there was no fair judgement.

Isa 59:16 He saw there was no one and wondered there was no one to intervene. So he made his own arm his
mainstay, his own saving justice his support.

Isa 59:17 He put on saving justice like a breastplate, on his head the helmet of salvation. He put on the clothes
of vengeance like a tunic and wrapped himself in jealousy like a cloak.

Isa 59:18 To each he repays his due, retribution to his enemies, reprisals on his foes, to the coasts and islands
he will repay their due.

Isa 59:19 From the west, Yahweh’s name will be feared, and from the east, his glory, for he will come like a
pent-up stream impelled by the breath of Yahweh.

Isa 59:20 Then for Zion will come a redeemer, for those who stop rebelling in Jacob, declares Yahweh.

Isa 59:21 “For my part, this is my covenant with them, says Yahweh. My spirit with which I endowed you, and
my words that I have put in your mouth, will not leave your mouth, or the mouths of your children, or the mouths
of your children’s children, says Yahweh, henceforth and for ever”.

Isa 60:1 Arise, shine out, for your light has come, and the glory of Yahweh has risen on you.

Isa 60:2 Look! though night still covers the earth and darkness the peoples, on you Yahweh is rising and over
you his glory can be seen.

Isa 60:3 The nations will come to your light and kings to your dawning brightness.

Isa 60:4 Lift up your eyes and look around: all are assembling and coming towards you, your sons coming from
far away and your daughters being carried on the hip.

Isa 60:5 At this sight you will grow radiant, your heart will throb and dilate, since the riches of the sea will flow to
you, the wealth of the nations come to you;

Isa 60:6 camels in throngs will fill your streets, the young camels of Midian and Ephah; everyone in Saba will
come, bringing gold and incense and proclaiming Yahweh’s praises.

Isa 60:7 All the flocks of Kedar will gather inside you, the rams of Nebaioth will be at your service as acceptable
victims on my altar, and I shall glorify my glorious house.

Isa 60:8 Who are these flying like a cloud, like doves to their dovecote?



Isa 60:9 Why, the coasts and islands put their hope in me and the vessels of Tarshish take the lead in bringing
your children from far away, and their silver and gold with them, for the sake of the name of Yahweh your God,
of the Holy One of Israel who has made you glorious.

Isa 60:10 Foreigners will rebuild your walls and their kings will serve you. For though I struck you in anger, in
mercy I have pitied you.

Isa 60:1 1 Your gates will always be open, never closed, either day or night, for the riches of the nations to be
brought you and their kings to be let in.

Isa 60:12 For the nation and kingdom that will not serve you will perish, and the nations will be utterly destroyed.
Isa 60:13 The glory of the Lebanon will come to you, cypress, plane-tree, box-tree, one and all, to adorn the site
of my sanctuary, for me to honour the place where I stand.

Isa 60:14 Your oppressors’ children will humbly approach you, at your feet all who despised you will fall
addressing you as ‘City of Yahweh’, ‘Zion of the Holy One of Israel’.

Isa 60:15 Instead of your being forsaken and hated, avoided by everyone, I will make you an object of eternal
pride, a source of joy from age to age.

Isa 60:16 You will suck the milk of nations, you will suck the wealth of kings, and you will know that I, Yahweh,
am your Saviour, that your redeemer is the Mighty One of Jacob.

Isa 60:17 For bronze I shall bring gold and for iron I shall bring silver, and for wood, bronze, and for stone, iron; I
shall make Peace your administration and Saving Justice your government.

Isa 60:18 Violence will no longer be heard of in your country, nor devastation and ruin within your frontiers. You
will call your walls ‘Salvation’ and your gates ‘Praise’.

Isa 60:19 No more will the sun give you daylight, nor moonlight shine on you, but Yahweh will be your
everlasting light, your God will be your splendour.

Isa 60:20 Your sun will set no more nor will your moon wane, for Yahweh will be your everlasting light and your
days of mourning will be over.

Isa 60:21 Your people, all of them upright, will possess the country for ever, the shoot I myself have planted, my
handiwork, for my own glory.

Isa 60:22 The smallest will grow into a thousand, the weakest one into a mighty nation. When the time is ripe, I,
Yahweh, shall quickly bring it about.

Isa 61:1 The spirit of Lord Yahweh is on me for Yahweh has anointed me. He has sent me to bring the news to
the afflicted, to soothe the broken-hearted,

Isa 61 :2 to proclaim liberty to captives, release to those in prison, to proclaim a year of favour from Yahweh and
a day of vengeance for our God, to comfort all who mourn

Isa 61 :3 (to give to Zion’s mourners), to give them for ashes a garland, for mourning-dress, the oil of gladness,
for despondency, festal attire; and they will be called “terebinths of saving justice”, planted by Yahweh to glorify
him.

Isa 61:4 They will rebuild the ancient ruins, they will raise what has long lain waste, they will restore the ruined
cities, all that has lain waste for ages past.

Isa 61 :5 Strangers will come forward to feed your flocks, foreigners be your ploughmen and vinedressers;

Isa 61 :6 but you will be called ‘priests of Yahweh’ and be addressed as ‘ministers of our God’. You will feed on
the wealth of nations, you will supplant them in their glory.

Isa 61:7 To make up for your shame, you will receive double; instead of disgrace, shouts of joy will be their lot;
yes, they will have a double portion in their country and everlasting joy will be theirs.

Isa 61:8 For I am Yahweh: I love fair judgement, I hate robbery and wrong-doing, and I shall reward them
faithfully and make an everlasting covenant with them.

Isa 61 :9 Their race will be famous throughout the nations and their offspring throughout the peoples. All who
see them will admit that they are a race whom Yahweh has blessed.

Isa 61:10 I exult for joy in Yahweh, my soul rejoices in my God, for he has clothed me in garments of salvation,
he has wrapped me in a cloak of saving justice, like a bridegroom wearing his garland, like a bride adorned in
her jewels.

Isa 61:11 For as the earth sends up its shoots and a garden makes seeds sprout, so Lord Yahweh makes
saving justice and praise spring up in the sight of all nations.

Isa 62:1 About Zion I will not be silent, about Jerusalem I shall not rest until saving justice dawns for her like a
bright light and her salvation like a blazing torch.

Isa 62:2 The nations will then see your saving justice, and all kings your glory, and you will be called a new
name which Yahweh’s mouth will reveal.

Isa 62:3 You will be a crown of splendour in Yahweh’s hand, a princely diadem in the hand of your God.

Isa 62:4 No more will you be known as “Forsaken” or your country be known as “Desolation”; instead, you will be
called “My Delight is in her” and your country “The Wedded”; for Yahweh will take delight in you and your country
will have its wedding.



Isa 62:5 Like a young man marrying a virgin, your rebuilder will wed you, and as the bridegroom rejoices in his
bride, so will your God rejoice in you.

Isa 62:6 On your walls, Jerusalem, I have posted watchmen; they will never fall silent, day or night. No peace for
you, as you keep Yahweh’s attention!

Isa 62:7 And give him no peace either until he restores Jerusalem and makes her the pride of the world!

Isa 62:8 Yahweh has sworn by his right hand and by his mighty arm: Never again shall I give your grain to feed
your enemies. Never again will foreigners drink the wine for which you have toiled.

Isa 62:9 No, the reapers will eat it and praise Yahweh, the harvesters will drink it in my sacred courts!

Isa 62:10 Pass through, pass through the gates. Clear a way for my people! Level up, level up the highway,
remove the stones! Hoist a signal to the peoples!

Isa 62:1 1 This is what Yahweh has proclaimed to the remotest part of earth: Say to the daughter of Zion, “Look,
your salvation is coming; with him comes his reward, his achievement precedes him!”.

Isa 62:12 They will be called ‘The Holy People’, ‘Yahweh’s Redeemed’, while you will be called ‘Sought-after’,
‘City-not-forsaken’.

Isa 63:1 Who is this coming from Edom, from Bozrah in crimson garments, so magnificently dressed, marching
so full of strength? - It is I, whose word is saving justice, whose power is to save.

Isa 63:2 -Why are your garments red, your clothes like someöne treading the winepress?

Isa 63:3 -I have trodden the winepress alone; of my people, not one was with me. So I trod them down in my
anger, I trampled on them in my wrath. Their blood squirted over my garments and all my clothes are stained.

Isa 63:4 For I have decided on a day of vengeance, my year of retribution has come.

Isa 63:5 I looked: there was no one to help me; I was appalled but could find no supporter! Then my own arm
came to my rescue and my own fury supported me.

Isa 63:6 I crushed the peoples in my anger, I shattered them in my fury and sent their blood streaming to the
ground.

Isa 63:7 I shall recount Yahweh’s acts of faithful love, Yahweh’s praises, in return for all that Yahweh has done
for us, for his great kindness to the House of Israel, for all that he has done in his mercy, for the abundance of
his acts of faithful love.

Isa 63:8 For he said, “Truly they are my people, children who will not betray me”, and he became their Saviour.
Isa 63:9 In all their troubles, it was no messenger or angel but his presence that saved them. In his love and pity
he himself redeemed them, lifted them up and carried them throughout the days of old.

Isa 63:10 But they rebelled and vexed his holy Spirit. Then he became their enemy and himself waged war on
them.

Isa 63:1 1 But he called the past to mind, Moses his servant. Where is he who saved them from the sea, the
Shepherd of his flock? Where was he who put his holy Spirit among them,

Isa 63:12 whose glorious arm led the way by Moses’ right hand? Who divided the waters before them to win
himself everlasting renown,

Isa 63:13 who led them through the depths as easily as a horse through the desert? They stumbled as little
Isa 63:14 as cattle going down to the plain. Yahweh’s Spirit led them to rest. This was how you guided your
people to win yourself glorious renown.

Isa 63:15 Look down from heaven and see from your holy and glorious dwelling. Where is your zeal and your
might? Are your deepest feelings, your mercy to me, to be restrained?

Isa 63:16 After all, you are our Father. If Abraham will not own us, if Israel will not acknowledge us, you,

Yahweh, are our Father, “Our Redeemer” is your name from of old.

Isa 63:17 Why, Yahweh, do you let us wander from your ways and let our hearts grow too hard to fear you?
Return, for the sake of your servants, the tribes of your heritage.

Isa 63:18 Your holy people have owned it for so short a time, our enemies have trampled on your sanctuary.

Isa 63:19 We have long been like those you do not rule, people who do not bear your name. Oh, that you would
tear the heavens open and come down — in your presence the mountains would quake,

Isa 64:1 as fire sets brushwood alight, as fire makes water boil — to make your name known to your foes; the
nations would tremble at your presence,

Isa 64:2 at the unexpected miracles you would do. (Oh, that you would come down, in your presence the
mountains would quake!)

Isa 64:3 Never has anyone heard, no ear has heard, no eye has seen any god but you act like this for the sake
of those who trust him.

Isa 64:4 You come to meet those who are happy to act uprightly; keeping your ways reminds them of you. Yes,
you have been angry and we have been sinners; now we persist in your ways and we shall be saved.

Isa 64:5 We have all been like unclean things and our upright deeds like filthy rags. We wither, all of us, like
leaves, and all our misdeeds carry us off like the wind.

Isa 64:6 There is no one to invoke your name, to rouse himself to hold fast to you, for you have hidden your face



from us and given us up to the power of our misdeeds.

Isa 64:7 And yet, Yahweh, you are our Father; we the clay and you our potter, all of us are the work of your
hands.

Isa 64:8 Yahweh, do not let your anger go too far and do not remember guilt for ever. Look, please, we are all
your people;

Isa 64:9 your holy cities have become a desert, Zion has become a desert, Jerusalem a wasteland.

Isa 64:10 Our holy and glorious Temple, in which our ancestors used to praise you, has been burnt to the
ground; all our delight lies in ruins.

Isa 64:1 1 Yahweh, can you restrain yourself at all this? Will you stay silent and afflict us beyond endurance?

Isa 65:1 I have let myself be approached by those who did not consult me, I have let myself be found by those
who did not seek me. I said, “Here I am, here I am!”. to a nation that did not invoke my name.

Isa 65:2 Each day I stretched out my hands to a rebellious people who follow a way which is not good, as the
fancy takes them;

Isa 65:3 a people constantly provoking me to my face by sacrificing in gardens, burning incense on bricks,

Isa 65:4 living in tombs, spending the night in dark corners, eating the meat of pigs, putting unclean foods on
their plates.

Isa 65:5 “Keep your distance”, they say, “do not touch me, lest my sanctity come near you!”. Such words are like
stifling smoke to me, an ever-burning fire.

Isa 65:6 Look, it is inscribed before me: I shall not be silent until I have repaid them, repaid them in full,

Isa 65:7 punished your guilt and your ancestors’ guilt together, Yahweh declares. For having burnt incense on
the mountains and insulted me on the hills, I shall pay them back in full for what they have done.

Isa 65:8 Yahweh says this: As when a bunch of grapes is found still to have juice in it, people say, “Do not
destroy it, for it contains a blessing”, so I shall act for my servants’ sake, I shall not destroy them all.

Isa 65:9 I shall produce descendants from Jacob and heirs to my mountains from Judah, my chosen ones will
own them and my servants will live there.

Isa 65:10 Sharon will be a pasture for flocks, the Valley of Achor a feeding ground for cattle, for those of my
people who have sought me.

Isa 65:1 1 But as for those of you who abandon Yahweh, who forget my holy mountain, who lay the table for
Gad, who fill cups of mixed wine for Meni,

Isa 65:12 you I shall destine to the sword and all of you will stoop to be slaughtered, because I called and you
would not answer, I spoke and you would not listen; you have done what I consider evil, you chose to do what
displeases me.

Isa 65:13 Therefore Lord Yahweh says this: You will see my servants eating while you go hungry; you will see
my servants drinking while you go thirsty; you will see my servants rejoicing while you are put to shame;

Isa 65:14 you will hear my servants shouting for joy of heart, while you shriek for sorrow of heart and howl with a
broken spirit.

Isa 65:15 And you will leave your name behind as a curse for my chosen ones, “May Lord Yahweh strike you
dead!”. But to his servants he will give another name.

Isa 65:16 Whoëver blesses himself on earth will bless himself by the God of truth, and whoëver swears an oath
on earth will swear by the God of truth, for past troubles will be forgotten and hidden from my eyes.

Isa 65:17 For look, I am going to create new heavens and a new earth, and the past will not be remembered
and will come no more to mind.

Isa 65:18 Rather be joyful, be glad for ever at what I am creating, for look, I am creating Jerusalem to be “Joy”
and my people to be “Gladness'.

Isa 65:19 I shall be joyful in Jerusalem and I shall rejoice in my people. No more will the sound of weeping be
heard there, nor the sound of a shriek;

Isa 65:20 never again will there be an infant there who lives only a few days, nor an old man who does not run
his full course; for the youngest will die at a hundred, and at a hundred the sinner will be accursed.

Isa 65:21 They will build houses and live in them, they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.

Isa 65:22 They will not build for others to live in, or plant for others to eat; for the days of my people will be like
the days of a tree, and my chosen ones will themselves use what they have made.

Isa 65:23 They will not toil in vain, nor bear children destined to disaster, for they are the race of Yahweh’s
blessed ones and so are their offspring.

Isa 65:24 Thus, before they call I shall answer, before they stop speaking I shall have heard.

Isa 65:25 The wolf and the young lamb will feed together, the lion will eat hay like the ox, and dust be the
serpent’s food. No hurt, no harm will be done on all my holy mountain, Yahweh says.

Isa 66:1 Thus says Yahweh: With heaven my throne and earth my footstool, what house could you build me,
what place for me to rest,

Isa 66:2 when all these things were made by me and all belong to me? - declares Yahweh. But my eyes are



drawn to the person of humbled and contrite spirit, who trembles at my word.

Isa 66:3 Some slaughter a bull, some kill a human being, some sacrifice a lamb, some strangle a dog, some
present an offering of pig’s blood, some burn memorial incense, a revolting blessing; all these people have
chosen their own ways and take delight in their disgusting practices.

Isa 66:4 I too take delight in making fools of them, I shall bring what they most fear down on them because I
have called and no one would answer, I spoke and no one listened. They have done what I regard as evil, have
chosen what displeases me.

Isa 66:5 Listen to the word of Yahweh, you who tremble at his word. Your brothers, who hate and reject you
because of my name, have said, “Let Yahweh show his glory, let us witness your joy!”. But they will be put to
shame.

Isa 66:6 Listen! An uproar from the city! A voice from the Temple! The voice of Yahweh bringing retribution on
his enemies.

Isa 66:7 Before being in labour she has given birth. Before the birth pangs came, she has been delivered of a
child.

Isa 66:8 Who ever heard of such a thing, who ever saw anything like this? Can a country be born in one day?
Can a nation be brought forth all at once? For Zion, scarcely in labour, has brought forth her children!

Isa 66:9 Shall I open the womb and not bring to birth? says Yahweh. Shall I, who bring to birth, close the womb?
says your God.

Isa 66:10 Rejoice with Jerusalem, be glad for her, all you who love her! Rejoice, rejoice with her, all you who
mourned her!

Isa 66:1 1 So that you may be suckled and satisfied from her consoling breast, so that you may drink deep with
delight from her generous nipple.

Isa 66:12 For Yahweh says this: Look, I am going to send peace flowing over her like a river, and like a stream
in spate the glory of the nations. You will be suckled, carried on her hip and fondled in her lap.

Isa 66:13 As a mother comforts a child, so I shall comfort you; you will be comforted in Jerusalem.

Isa 66:14 At the sight your heart will rejoice, and your limbs regain vigour like the grass. To his servants Yahweh
will reveal his hand, but to his enemies his fury.

Isa 66:15 For see how Yahweh comes in fire, his chariots like the whirlwind, to assuage his anger with burning,
his rebukes with flaming fire.

Isa 66:16 For by fire will Yahweh execute fair judgement, and by his sword, on all people; and Yahweh’s victims
will be many.

Isa 66:17 As for those who sanctify themselves and purify themselves to enter the gardens, following the one in
the centre, who eat the flesh of pigs, revolting things and rats: their deeds and their thoughts will perish together,
declares Yahweh.

Isa 66:18 I am coming to gather every nation and every language. They will come to witness my glory.

Isa 66:19 I shall give them a sign and send some of their survivors to the nations: to Tarshish, Put, Lud,
Meshech, Tubal and Javan, to the distant coasts and islands that have never heard of me or seen my glory.

They will proclaim my glory to the nations,

Isa 66:20 and from all the nations they will bring all your brothers as an offering to Yahweh, on horses, in
chariots, in litters, on mules and on camels, to my holy mountain, Jerusalem, Yahweh says, like Israelites
bringing offerings in clean vessels to Yahweh’s house.

Isa 66:21 And some of them I shall make into priests and Levites, Yahweh says.

Isa 66:22 For as the new heavens and the new earth I am making will endure before me, declares Yahweh, so
will your race and your name endure.

Isa 66:23 From New Moon to New Moon, from Sabbath to Sabbath, all humanity will come and bow in my
presence, Yahweh says.

Isa 66:24 And on their way out they will see the corpses of those who rebelled against me; for their worm will
never die nor their fire be put out, and they will be held in horror by all humanity.
