<h4>Title (1:1)</h4>

<p>The vision of Isaiah son of Amoz concerning Judah and Jerusalem, which he received in the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah kings of Judah.</p>

<h4>Against an ungrateful people (1:2–9)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Listen, you heavens; earth, attend, for Yahweh is speaking,</span><br />
		<span>“I have reared children and brought them up,</span><br />
		<span>but they have rebelled against me.</span><br />
		<span>The ox knows its owner and the donkey its master’s crib; </span><br />
		<span>Israel does not know, my people do not understand”.</span><br />
		<span>Disaster, sinful nation, people weighed down with guilt, </span><br />
		<span>race of wrong-doers, perverted children! </span><br />
		<span>They have abandoned Yahweh, despised the Holy One of Israel, </span><br />
		<span>they have turned away from him.</span><br />
		<span>Where shall I strike you next, if you persist in treason?</span><br />
		<span>The whole head is sick, the whole heart is diseased,</span><br />
		<span>from the sole of the foot to the head there is nothing healthy:</span><br />
		<span>only wounds, bruises and open sores </span><br />
		<span>not dressed, not bandaged, not soothed with ointment,</span><br />
		<span>your country a desolation, your towns burnt down, </span><br />
		<span>your soil, foreigners lay it waste before your eyes, </span><br />
		<span>a desolation like devastation by foreigners. </span><br />
		<span>The daughter of Zion is left like a shanty in a vineyard, </span><br />
		<span>like a shed in a cucumber field, like a city besieged.</span><br />
		<span>Had Yahweh Sabaoth not left us a few survivors, </span><br />
		<span>we should be like Sodom, we should be the same as Gomorrah.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Against hypocrisy (1:10–20)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Hear what Yahweh says, you rulers of Sodom;</span><br />
		<span>listen to what our God teaches, you people of Gomorrah.</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>“What are your endless sacrifices to me?”, says Yahweh. </span><br />
		<span>“I am sick of burnt offerings of rams </span><br />
		<span>and the fat of calves. </span><br />
		<span>I take no pleasure in the blood </span><br />
		<span>of bulls and lambs and goats.</span><br />
		<span>When you come and present yourselves before me,</span><br />
		<span>who has asked you to trample through my courts?</span><br />
		<span>Bring no more futile cereal offerings, </span><br />
		<span>the smoke from them fills me with disgust. </span><br />
		<span>New Moons, Sabbaths, assemblies — I cannot endure solemnity </span><br />
		<span>combined with guilt.</span><br />
		<span>Your New Moons and your meetings I utterly detest; </span><br />
		<span>to me they are a burden I am tired of bearing.</span><br />
		<span>When you stretch out your hands I turn my eyes away. </span><br />
		<span>You may multiply your prayers, I shall not be listening. </span><br />
		<span>Your hands are covered in blood,</span><br />
		<span>wash, make yourselves clean. </span><br />
		<span>Take your wrong-doing out of my sight. </span><br />
		<span>Cease doing evil. Learn to do good, </span><br />
		<span>search for justice, discipline the violent, </span><br />
		<span>be just to the orphan, plead for the widow.</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>“Come, let us talk this over”, says Yahweh. </span><br />
		<span>“Though your sins are like scarlet, </span><br />
		<span>they shall be white as snow; </span><br />
		<span>though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool.</span><br />
		<span>If you are willing to obey, you shall eat the good things of the earth.</span><br />
		<span>But if you refuse and rebel, the sword shall eat you instead —</span><br />
		<span>for Yahweh’s mouth has spoken”.</span>

<h4>Lament for Jerusalem (1:21–28)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">

		<span>what a harlot she has become!</span><br />
		<span>Zion, once full of fair judgement,</span><br />
		<span>where saving justice used to dwell,</span><br />
		<span>but now assassins!</span>

	<p class="poem">
		<span>Your silver has turned into dross, </span><br />

	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>All of them greedy for presents</span><br />
		<span>and eager for bribes,</span><br />
		<span>they show no justice to the orphan,</span><br />
		<span>and the widow’s cause never reaches them.</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Hence, the Lord Yahweh Sabaoth, </span><br />
		<span>the Mighty One of Israel, says this, </span><br />
		<span>“Disaster, I shall get the better of my enemies, </span><br />
		<span>I shall avenge myself on my foes.</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>“I shall turn my hand against you,</span><br />

	<p class="poem">
		<span>“And I shall restore your judges as at first, </span><br />
		<span>your counsellors as in bygone days, </span><br />
		<span>after which you will be called City of Saving Justice, </span><br />
		<span>Faithful City”.</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Zion will be redeemed by fair judgement, </span><br />
		<span>and those who return, by saving justice.</span><br />
		<span>Rebels and sinners alike will be destroyed, </span><br />
		<span>and those who abandon Yahweh will perish.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Against sacred trees (1:29–31)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>How ashamed you will be of the terebinths </span><br />
		<span>which gave you such delight; </span><br />
		<span>and how you will blush for the gardens which you chose!</span><br />
		<span>For you will be like a terebinth with faded leaves, </span><br />
		<span>like a garden without water;</span><br />
		<span>the strong will become like tinder, his work like the spark; </span><br />
		<span>both will go up in flames together, </span><br />
		<span>with no one to put them out.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Everlasting peace (2:1–5)</h4>

<p>The vision of Isaiah son of Amoz, concerning Judah and Jerusalem.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>It will happen in the final days </span><br />
		<span>that the mountain of Yahweh’s house </span><br />
		<span>will rise higher than the mountains</span><br />
		<span>and tower above the heights. </span><br />
		<span>Then all the nations will stream to it, </span><br />
		<span>many peoples will come to it and say, </span><br />
		<span>“Come, let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh, </span><br />
		<span>to the house of the God of Jacob </span><br />
		<span>that he may teach us his ways </span><br />
		<span>so that we may walk in his paths”. </span><br />
		<span>For the Law will issue from Zion </span><br />
		<span>and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem.</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Then he will judge between the nations </span><br />
		<span>and arbitrate between many peoples. </span><br />
		<span>They will hammer their swords into ploughshares </span><br />
		<span>and their spears into sickles. </span><br />
		<span>Nation will not lift sword against nation, </span><br />
		<span>no longer will they learn how to make war.</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>House of Jacob, come, let us walk in Yahweh’s light.</span>

<h4>The brilliance of Yahweh’s majesty (2:6–17)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>You have rejected your people, the House of Jacob, </span><br />
		<span>for it has long been full of sorcerers </span><br />
		<span>like the Philistines, </span><br />
		<span>and is overrun with foreigners.</span><br />
		<span>The country is full of silver and gold and treasures unlimited, </span><br />
		<span>the country is full of horses, its chariots are unlimited;</span><br />
		<span>the country is full of idols. </span><br />
		<span>They bow down before the work of their hands, </span><br />
		<span>before what their own fingers have made.</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Human nature has been humbled, humankind brought low: </span><br />

	<p class="poem">
		<span>Human pride will lower its eyes, </span><br />
		<span>human arrogance will be humbled, </span><br />

		<span>That will be a day for Yahweh Sabaoth, </span><br />
		<span>for all who are majestic and haughty, </span><br />
		<span>for all who are proud, to be brought low,</span><br />
		<span>for all the cedars of Lebanon, high and proud, </span><br />

		<span>for every lofty tower </span><br />
		<span>and for every towering wall;</span><br />

<p>That day, people will fling to moles and bats the silver idols and golden idols which have been made for them to worship,</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">

		<span>and the clefts in the cliffs, </span><br />

<h4>Anarchy in Jerusalem (3:1–15)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Now the Lord Yahweh Sabaoth </span><br />
		<span>is about to deprive Jerusalem and Judah </span><br />
		<span>of resources and provisions —</span><br />
		<span>all reserves of food, all reserves of water —</span><br />
		<span>of hero, warrior, judge, prophet, </span><br />
		<span>diviner, elder, captain, dignitary, </span><br />
		<span>counsellor, architect, soothsayer.</span><br />
		<span>“I shall give them boys for princes, </span><br />
		<span>raw lads to rule over them”.</span><br />
		<span>People will be ill-treated by one another, </span><br />
		<span>each by his neighbour; </span><br />
		<span>the young will insult the aged, </span><br />
		<span>and the low, the respected.</span><br />
		<span>Yes, a man will catch hold of his brother </span><br />
		<span>in their father’s house, to say, </span><br />
		<span>“You have a cloak, so you be leader, </span><br />
		<span>and rule this heap of ruins”.</span><br />
		<span>And, that day, the other will protest, </span><br />
		<span>“I am no healer; </span><br />
		<span>in my house there is neither food nor clothing; </span><br />
		<span>do not make me leader of the people”.</span><br />
		<span>For Jerusalem has collapsed </span><br />
		<span>and Judah has fallen, </span><br />
		<span>because their words and deeds affront Yahweh </span><br />
		<span>and insult his glorious gaze.</span><br />
		<span>Their complacency bears witness against them, </span><br />
		<span>they parade their sin like Sodom; </span><br />
		<span>they do not conceal it, all the worse for them, </span><br />
		<span>for they have hatched their own downfall.</span><br />
		<span>Say, “Blessed the upright, </span><br />
		<span>for he will feed on the fruit of his deeds;</span><br />
		<span>woe to the wicked, it will go ill with him, </span><br />
		<span>for he will be treated as his actions deserve”.</span><br />
		<span>O my people, their oppressors pillage them </span><br />
		<span>and extortioners rule over them! </span><br />
		<span>O my people, your rulers mislead you </span><br />
		<span>and efface the paths you ought to follow!</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh has risen to accuse, </span><br />
		<span>is standing to pass judgement on the people.</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh is about to try </span><br />
		<span>the elders and the princes of his people, </span><br />
		<span>“You are the ones who have ravaged the vineyard, </span><br />
		<span>the spoils of the poor are in your houses.</span><br />
		<span>By what right do you crush my people </span><br />
		<span>and grind the faces of the poor?”, </span><br />
		<span>says the Lord Yahweh Sabaoth.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>The women of Jerusalem (3:16–24)</h4>

<p>Yahweh says:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Because Zion’s daughters are proud </span><br />
		<span>and walk with heads held high </span><br />
		<span>and enticing eyes — with mincing steps they go, </span><br />
		<span>jingling the bangles on their feet —</span><br />
		<span>the Lord will give Zion’s daughters scabby heads, </span><br />
		<span>Yahweh will lay their foreheads bare.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That day the Lord will take away the ornamental chains, medallions, crescents, pendants, bracelets, trinkets, diadems, ankle-chains, necklaces, scent bottles, amulets, finger-rings, nose-rings, party dresses, cloaks, scarves, purses, mirrors, linen clothes, turbans and mantillas.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Then, instead of perfume, a stink; </span><br />
		<span>instead of belt, a rope, </span><br />
		<span>instead of hair elaborately dressed, a shaven scalp, </span><br />
		<span>instead of gorgeous clothes, sacking around the waist, </span><br />
		<span>and brand marks instead of beauty.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Misery in Jerusalem (3:25–4:1)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Your men will fall by the sword, </span><br />
		<span>your warriors in battle,</span><br />
		<span>and her gates will moan and mourn; </span><br />
		<span>she will sit on the ground, deserted.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p >That day, seven women will catch hold of one man and say, “We will eat our own food, and wear our own clothing, but just let us bear your name. Take our disgrace away”.</p>

<h4>Yahweh’s seedling (4:2–6)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>That day, Yahweh’s seedling will turn to beauty and glory, </span><br />
		<span>what the earth brings forth will turn to the pride and ornament </span><br />
		<span>of Israel’s survivors.</span><br />
		<span>Those who are left in Zion and remain in Jerusalem </span><br />
		<span>will be called holy, </span><br />
		<span>all those in Jerusalem noted down to live.</span><br />
		<span>When the Lord has washed away </span><br />
		<span>the filth of Zion’s daughters </span><br />
		<span>and with the wind of judgement and the wind of burning cleansed </span><br />
		<span>Jerusalem of the blood shed in her,</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh will create, </span><br />
		<span>over every house on Mount Zion </span><br />
		<span>and over those who assemble there, </span><br />
		<span>a cloud by day, </span><br />
		<span>and by night smoke with the brightness of a flaring fire. </span><br />
		<span>For over all will be the Glory as canopy and tent </span><br />
		<span>to give shade by day from the heat, </span><br />
		<span>refuge and shelter from the storm and the rain.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>The song of the vineyard (5:1–7)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Let me sing my beloved</span><br />
		<span>the song of my friend for his vineyard.</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>My beloved had a vineyard </span><br />
		<span>on a fertile hillside.</span><br />
		<span>He dug it, cleared it of stones, </span><br />
		<span>and planted it with red grapes. </span><br />
		<span>In the middle he built a tower, </span><br />
		<span>he hewed a press there too. </span><br />
		<span>He expected it to yield fine grapes: </span><br />
		<span>wild grapes were all it yielded.</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>And now, citizens of Jerusalem and people of Judah, </span><br />
		<span>I ask you to judge between me and my vineyard.</span><br />
		<span>What more could I have done for my vineyard </span><br />
		<span>that I have not done? </span><br />
		<span>Why, when I expected it to yield fine grapes, </span><br />
		<span>has it yielded wild ones?</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Very well, I shall tell you what I am going to do to my vineyard: </span><br />
		<span>I shall take away its hedge, for it to be grazed on, </span><br />
		<span>and knock down its wall, for it to be trampled on.</span><br />
		<span>I shall let it go to waste, unpruned, undug, </span><br />
		<span>overgrown by brambles and thorn-bushes, </span><br />
		<span>and I shall command the clouds to rain no rain on it.</span><br />
		<span>Now, the vineyard of Yahweh Sabaoth is the House of Israel, </span><br />
		<span>and the people of Judah the plant he cherished. </span><br />
		<span>He expected fair judgement, but found injustice, </span><br />
		<span>uprightness, but found cries of distress.</span>

		<span>Yahweh Sabaoth has sworn this in my hearing, </span><br />
		<span>“Many houses will be brought to ruin, </span><br />
		<span>great and fine ones left untenanted;</span><br />
		<span>for ten acres of vineyard will yield only one barrel, </span><br />

<h3 id="ib">B: The Book of Immanuel (6:1–12:6)</h3>

<h4>The call of Isaiah (6:1–13)</h4>

<p>In the year of King Uzziah’s death I saw the Lord seated on a high and lofty throne; his train filled the sanctuary. Above him stood seraphs, each one with six wings: two to cover its face, two to cover its feet and two for flying; and they were shouting these words to each other:</p> 

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Holy, holy, holy is Yahweh Sabaoth.</span><br />
		<span>His glory fills the whole earth.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The door-posts shook at the sound of their shouting, and the Temple was full of smoke. Then I said:</p> 

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>“Woe is me! I am lost, </span><br />
		<span>for I am a man of unclean lips </span><br />
		<span>and I live among a people of unclean lips, </span><br />
		<span>and my eyes have seen the King, Yahweh Sabaoth”.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then one of the seraphs flew to me, holding in its hand a live coal which it had taken from the altar with a pair of tongs. With this it touched my mouth and said:</p> 

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>“Look, this has touched your lips,</span><br />
		<span>your guilt has been removed</span><br />
		<span>and your sin forgiven”.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I then heard the voice of the Lord saying:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>“Whom shall I send? Who will go for us?”.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote> 

<p>And I said, “Here am I, send me”. He said:</p> 

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>“Go, and say to this people, </span><br />
		<span>‘Listen and listen, but never understand! </span><br />
		<span>Look and look, but never perceive!’.</span><br />
		<span>Make this people’s heart coarse, </span><br />
		<span>make their ears dull, shut their eyes tight, </span><br />
		<span>or they will use their eyes to see, </span><br />
		<span>use their ears to hear, </span><br />
		<span>use their heart to understand, </span><br />
		<span>and change their ways and be healed”.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I then said, “Until when, Lord?”. </p>

<p>He replied, “Until towns are in ruins and deserted, houses untenanted and a great desolation reigns in the land, and Yahweh has driven the people away and the country is totally abandoned. And suppose one-tenth of them are left in it, that will be stripped again, like the terebinth, like the oak, cut back to the stock; their stock is a holy seed”.</p>

<h4>Isaiah intervenes (7:1–9)</h4>

<p>In the reign of Ahaz son of Jotham, son of Uzziah king of Judah, Razon king of Aram advanced on Jerusalem with Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel, to attack it; but he was unable to attack it. The House of David was informed: “Aram has halted in Ephraimite territory”. At this, his heart and his people’s hearts shook like forest trees shaking in the wind.</p>

<p>Yahweh then said to Isaiah, “Go out with your son Shear-Jashub, and meet Ahaz at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, on the road to the Fuller’s Field, and say to him, ‘Pay attention and keep calm. Do not be frightened or demoralised by these two smouldering sticks of firewood, by the fierce anger of Razon, Aram and the son of Remaliah, or because Aram, Ephraim and the son of Remaliah have been plotting against you and saying: Let us mount an attack on Judah, destroy it, force it onto our side and install the son of Tabeel there as king.</p>

<p>‘Lord Yahweh says this:</p> 

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>This will not happen, it will never occur,</span><br />
		<span>for the head of Aram is Damascus, </span><br />
		<span>and the head of Damascus is Razon; </span><br />
		<span>another sixty-five years, and</span><br />
		<span>Ephraim will cease to be a people.</span><br />
		<span>The head of Ephraim is Samaria,</span><br />
		<span>and the head of Samaria is the son of Remaliah.</span><br />
		<span>If you will not take your stand on me </span><br />
		<span>you will not stand firm’”.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Isaiah intervenes again (7:10–17)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Ahaz again and said:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Ask Yahweh your God for a sign, </span><br />
		<span>either in the depths of Sheol or in the heights above.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But Ahaz said, “I will not ask. I will not put Yahweh to the test”. He then said:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Listen now, House of David: </span><br />
		<span>are you not satisfied with trying human patience </span><br />
		<span>that you should try my God’s patience too?</span><br />
		<span>The Lord will give you a sign in any case: </span><br />
		<span>It is this: the young woman is with child </span><br />
		<span>and will give birth to a son </span><br />
		<span>whom she will call Immanuel.</span><br />
		<span>On curds and honey will he feed </span><br />
		<span>until he knows how to refuse the bad </span><br />
		<span>and choose the good.</span><br />
		<span>Before the child knows how to refuse the bad and choose the good, </span><br />
		<span>the lands whose two kings are frightening you will be deserted.</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh will bring times for you, </span><br />
		<span>your people and your ancestral House, </span><br />
		<span>such as have not been seen </span><br />
		<span>since Ephraim broke away from Judah (the king of Assyria).</span>
	</p>

<h4>Prediction of an invasion (7:18–25)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>When that day comes, </span><br />
		<span>Yahweh will whistle up mosquitoes </span><br />
		<span>from the distant streams of Egypt </span><br />
		<span>and bees from the land of Assyria,</span><br />
		<span>and they will all come and settle </span><br />
		<span>on the streams in the gullies, in the holes in the rocks, </span><br />
		<span>on all the thorn-bushes and on all the water-points.</span><br />
		<span>That day the Lord will shave, </span><br />
		<span>with a razor hired from the other side of the River </span><br />
		<span>(with the king of Assyria), </span><br />
		<span>the head and the hair of the leg, </span><br />
		<span>and take off the beard, too.</span><br />
		<span>When that day comes, each man will raise </span><br />
		<span>one heifer and two sheep,</span><br />
		<span>and because of the abundant milk they give </span><br />
		<span>(on curds will he feed) </span><br />
		<span>all who are left in the country </span><br />
		<span>will feed on curds and honey.</span><br />
		<span>When that day comes, wherever there used to be a thousand vines </span><br />
		<span>worth a thousand pieces of silver,</span><br />
		<span>all will be brambles and thorn-bushes;</span><br />
		<span>to be ventured into only with arrows and bow, </span><br />
		<span>for the country will be nothing but brambles and thorn-bushes.</span><br />
		<span>No more will you venture </span><br />
		<span>on any hillside formerly under the hoe </span><br />
		<span>for fear of the brambles and thorn-bushes; </span><br />
		<span>it will be fit only for pasturing the cattle, </span><br />
		<span>a tramping-ground for sheep.</span>

<h4>The birth of a son to Isaiah (8:1–4)</h4>

<p>Yahweh said to me, “Take a large tablet and on it with an ordinary stylus write, ‘Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz’. And take reliable witnesses, the priest Uriah and Zechariah son of Jeberechiah”.</p>

<p>I then had intercourse with the prophetess, who then conceived and gave birth to a son. Yahweh said to me, “Call him Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz, for before the child knows how to say ‘mother’ or ‘father’, the wealth of Damascus and the booty of Samaria will be carried away while the king of Assyria looks on”.</p>

<h4>Shiloah and the Euphrates ( 8:5–10)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to me again and said, “Since this people has rejected the waters of Shiloah which flow smoothly, and has trembled before Razon and the son of Remaliah, now, against it, the Lord will bring the mighty, swelling waters of the River (the king of Assyria and all his glory); the River will flood up all its channels and overflow all its banks; it will flow into Judah, flooding everything and passing on; it will reach right up to the neck, and the spreading of its wings will cover the whole extent of your country, Immanuel!</p>

<h4>Isaiah’s mission (8:11–20)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>For this was how Yahweh spoke to me when his hand seized hold of me </span><br />
		<span>and he taught me not to follow the path of this people, saying,</span><br />
		<span>“Do not call conspiracy all that this people calls conspiracy; </span><br />
		<span>do not dread what they dread, have no fear of that.</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh Sabaoth is the one you will proclaim holy, </span><br />
		<span>him you will dread, him you will fear.</span><br />
		<span>He will be a sanctuary, a stumbling-stone, </span><br />
		<span>a rock to trip up the two Houses of Israel; </span><br />
		<span>a snare and a trap for the inhabitants of Jerusalem,</span><br />
		<span>over which many of them will stumble, fall and be broken, </span><br />
		<span>be ensnared and made captive.</span><br />
		<span>Bind up the testimony, seal the instruction </span><br />
		<span>in the heart of my disciples”.</span><br />
		<span>My trust is in Yahweh who hides his face from the House of Jacob; </span><br />
		<span>I put my hope in him.</span><br />
		<span>Look, I and the children whom Yahweh has given me </span><br />
		<span>shall become signs and portents in Israel on behalf of </span><br />
		<span>Yahweh Sabaoth who dwells on Mount Zion.</span><br />
		<span>And should people say to you, </span><br />

		<span>I have issued orders </span><br />
		<span>to my sacred warriors, </span><br />
		<span>I have summoned my heroes to serve my anger, </span><br />
		<span>my proud champions.</span><br />
		<span>The noise of a great crowd in the mountains, </span><br />
		<span>like an immense people, </span><br />
		<span>the tumultuous sound of kingdoms, </span><br />
		<span>of nations mustering: </span><br />
		<span>it is Yahweh Sabaoth </span><br />
		<span>marshalling the troops for battle.</span><br />
		<span>They come from a distant country, from the far horizons, </span><br />
		<span>Yahweh and the instruments of his fury </span><br />
		<span>to lay the whole country waste.</span><br />
		<span>Howl! For the Day of Yahweh is near, </span><br />
		<span>coming like devastation from Shaddai.</span><br />
		<span>This is why all hands fall limp, </span><br />
		<span>why all the men are losing heart;</span><br />
		<span>they are panic-stricken, </span><br />
		<span>seized with pains and convulsions; </span><br />
		<span>they writhe like a woman in labour, </span><br />
		<span>they look at one another appalled, </span><br />
		<span>with feverish faces.</span><br />
		<span>Look, the Day of Yahweh is coming, </span><br />
		<span>merciless, with wrath and burning anger, </span><br />
		<span>to reduce the country to a desert </span><br />
		<span>and root out the sinners from it.</span><br />
		<span>For in the sky the stars and Orion </span><br />
		<span>will shed their light no longer, </span><br />
		<span>the sun will be dark when it rises, </span><br />
		<span>and the moon will no longer give its light.</span><br />
		<span>I am going to punish the world for its wickedness </span><br />
		<span>and the wicked for their guilt, </span><br />
		<span>and put an end to the pride of the arrogant </span><br />
		<span>and humble the haughtiness of despots.</span><br />
		<span>I shall make people scarcer than pure gold, </span><br />
		<span>human life scarcer than the gold of Ophir.</span><br />
		<span>This is why I am going to shake the heavens, </span><br />
		<span>why the earth will reel on its foundations, </span><br />
		<span>under the wrath of Yahweh Sabaoth, </span><br />
		<span>the day when his anger ignites.</span><br />
		<span>Then like a hunted gazelle, like sheep that nobody gathers in, </span><br />
		<span>everyone will head back to his people,</span><br />
		<span>everyone will flee to his native land.</span><br />
		<span>All those who are found will be stabbed, </span><br />
		<span>all those captured will fall by the sword,</span><br />
		<span>their babies dashed to pieces before their eyes, </span><br />
		<span>their houses plundered, their wives raped.</span><br />
		<span>Look, against them I am stirring up the Medes </span><br />
		<span>who care nothing for silver, </span><br />
		<span>who set no value by gold.</span><br />
		<span>Bows will annihilate the young men, </span><br />
		<span>they will have no pity for the fruit of the womb, </span><br />
		<span>or mercy in their eyes for children.</span><br />
		<span>And Babylon, that pearl of kingdoms, </span><br />
		<span>that splendid jewel of the Chaldaeans, </span><br />
		<span>will, like Sodom and Gomorrah, </span><br />
		<span>be overthrown by God.</span><br />
		<span>Never again will anyone live there or reside there </span><br />
		<span>for all generations to come. </span><br />
		<span>Never again will the Arab pitch his tent there, </span><br />
		<span>or the shepherds bring their flocks to rest.</span><br />
		<span>But beasts of the desert will make their haunt there </span><br />
		<span>and owls fill their houses, </span><br />
		<span>there ostriches will settle their home, </span><br />
		<span>there goats will dance.</span><br />
		<span>Hyenas will howl in its towers, </span><br />

<h4>The end of the exile (14:1–2)</h4>

<p>Yahweh will have pity on Jacob, he will choose Israel once more and resettle them on their native soil. Foreigners will join them, attaching themselves to the House of Jacob. Peoples will take them and escort them home, and the House of Israel will take them as slaves, men and women on Yahweh’s soil. They will enslave those who enslaved them and will master their oppressors.</p>

<h4>The death of the king of Babylon (14:3–23)</h4>

<p>That day, a man will look to his Creator and his eyes will turn to the Holy One of Israel. He will no longer look to altars, his own handiwork, or to what his own fingers have made: the sacred poles and incense-altars.</p>

<h4>Against Cush (18:1–7)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Disaster! Land of the whirring locust</span><br />
		<span>beyond the rivers of Cush,</span><br />
		<span>who send ambassadors by sea,</span><br />
		<span>in little reed-boats across the waters!</span><br />
		<span>Go, swift messengers</span><br />
		<span>to a nation tall and bronzed,</span><br />
		<span>to a people feared far and near,</span><br />
		<span>a mighty and masterful nation</span><br />
		<span>whose country is criss-crossed with rivers.</span><br />
		<span>All you who inhabit the world,</span><br />
		<span>you who people the earth,</span><br />
		<span>when the signal is hoisted on the mountains, you will see,</span><br />
		<span>when the ram’s-horn is sounded, you will hear.</span><br />
		<span>For this is what Yahweh has told me,</span><br />
		<span>“I shall sit here quietly looking down,</span><br />
		<span>like the burning heat in the daytime,</span><br />
		<span>like a dewy mist in the heat of harvest”.</span><br />
		<span>For, before the harvest, once the flowering is over</span><br />
		<span>and blossom turns into ripening grape,</span><br />
		<span>the branches will be cut off with pruning knives,</span><br />
		<span>and the shoots taken off, cut away.</span><br />
		<span>All has been abandoned</span><br />
		<span>to the mountain birds of prey</span><br />

		<span>the birds of prey will summer on them,</span><br />
		<span>and all the wild animals winter on them.</span>

<p>Then, an offering will be brought to Yahweh Sabaoth on behalf of a people tall and bronzed, on behalf of a people feared far and near, on behalf of a mighty and masterful nation whose country is criss-crossed with rivers: to the place where the name of Yahweh Sabaoth resides, Mount Zion.</p>

<h4>The conversion of Egypt (19:16–25)</h4>

<p>That day Egypt will be like women, trembling and terrified at the threatening hand of Yahweh Sabaoth, when he raises it against her. The land of Judah will become Egypt’s shame; whenever she is reminded of it, she will be terrified, because of the plan which Yahweh Sabaoth has laid against her. That day in Egypt there will be five towns speaking the language of Canaan and pledging themselves to Yahweh Sabaoth; one of them will be called City of the Sun. That day there will be an altar dedicated to Yahweh in the centre of Egypt and, close to the frontier, a pillar dedicated to Yahweh, and this will be a sign and a witness to Yahweh Sabaoth in Egypt. When they cry to Yahweh for help because of oppressors, he will send them a Saviour and leader to deliver them. Yahweh will reveal himself to Egypt, and the Egyptians will acknowledge Yahweh that day and will offer sacrifices and cereal offerings, and will make vows to Yahweh and perform them. And if Yahweh strikes Egypt, having struck he will heal, and they will turn to Yahweh who will hear their prayers and heal them. That day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. Assyria will have access to Egypt and Egypt have access to Assyria. Egypt will serve with Assyria.</p>

<p>That day Israel will make a third with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing at the centre of the world, and Yahweh Sabaoth will bless them in the words, “Blessed be my people Egypt, Assyria my creation, and Israel my heritage”.</p>

<h4>Relating to the capture of Ashdod (20:1–6)</h4>

<p>The year the general-in-chief, sent by Sargon king of Assyria, came to Ashdod and stormed and captured it at that time Yahweh spoke through Isaiah son of Amoz and said, “Go, undo the sackcloth around your waist and take the sandals off your feet”. And he did so, and walked about, naked and barefoot. Yahweh then said, “As my servant Isaiah has been walking about naked and barefoot for the last three years as a sign and portent for Egypt and Cush, so the king of Assyria will lead the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Cush, young and old, naked and barefoot, their buttocks bared, to the shame of Egypt. Then they will be afraid and ashamed of Cush their hope and Egypt their pride, and the inhabitants of this coast will say on that day, ‘Look what has happened to our hope, to those to whom we fled for help, to escape from the king of Assyria. How are we going to escape?’”.</p>

		<span>Advance, Elam, lay siege, Media!”.</span><br />
		<span>I have cut short all groaning.</span><br />
		<span>This is why my loins are racked with pain,</span><br />
		<span>why I am seized with pangs like the pangs of a woman in labour;</span><br />
		<span>I am too distressed to hear, too afraid to look.</span><br />
		<span>My heart is bewildered, dread overwhelms me,</span><br />
		<span>the twilight I longed for has become my horror.</span><br />
		<span>They lay the table, spread the cloth,</span><br />

	<p class="poem">

		<span>men mounted on donkeys, men mounted on camels;</span><br />

		<span>and all the images of her gods he has shattered to the ground!”.</span><br />
		<span>You whom I have threshed, grain of my threshing-floor,</span><br />

<p>When that day comes, Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, the length of one king’s life. But when the seventy years are over, Tyre will become like the whore in the song:</p>

	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the end of the seventy years Yahweh will visit Tyre. She will receive her pay again and play the whore with all the kingdoms of the world on the surface of the earth. But her profits and wages will be dedicated to Yahweh. They will not be stored or hoarded, but her profits will go to those who live in Yahweh’s presence, for them to have as much food as they want and splendid clothes.</p>

<h4>Sennacherib’s invasion (36:1–39:8)</h4>

<p>In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria advanced on all the fortified towns of Judah and captured them. From Lachish the king of Assyria sent the cupbearer-in-chief with a large force to King Hezekiah in Jerusalem. The cupbearer-in-chief took up position near the conduit of the upper pool on the road to the Fuller’s Field. The master of the palace, Eliakim son of Hilkiah, Shebna the secretary and the herald Joah son of Asaph went out to him. The cupbearer-in-chief said to them, “Say to Hezekiah, ‘The great king, the king of Assyria, says this: What makes you so confident? Do you think empty words are as good as strategy and military strength? Who are you relying on, to dare to rebel against me? There you are, relying on that broken reed, Egypt, which pricks and pierces the hand of the person who leans on it. That is what Pharaoh king of Egypt is like to all who rely on him. You may say to me: We rely on Yahweh our God. But haven’t his high places and altars been suppressed by Hezekiah, who told Judah and Jerusalem: This is the altar before which you must worship? Very well, then, make a wager with my lord the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses if you can find horsemen to ride them. How could you repulse a single one of the least of my master’s soldiers? And yet you have relied on Egypt for chariots and horsemen. And lastly, have I marched on this country to lay it waste without warrant from Yahweh? Yahweh himself said to me: March on this country and lay it waste’”.</p>

<p>Eliakim, Shebna and Joah said to the cupbearer-in-chief, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it; do not speak to us in the Judaean language within earshot of the people on the ramparts”.</p>

<p> But the cupbearer-in-chief said, “Do you think my lord sent me here to say these things to your master or to you? On the contrary, it was to the people sitting on the ramparts who, like you, are doomed to eat their own dung and drink their own urine”.</p>

<p>The cupbearer-in-chief then drew himself up and shouted loudly in the Judaean language, “Listen to the words of the great king, the king of Assyria. The king says this, ‘Do not let Hezekiah delude you! He will be powerless to save you. Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to rely on Yahweh by saying: Yahweh is sure to save us; this city will not fall into the king of Assyria’s clutches. Do not listen to Hezekiah, for the king of Assyria says this: Make peace with me, surrender to me, and every one of you will be free to eat the fruit of his own vine and of his own fig tree and to drink the water of his own storage-well until I come and take you away to a country like your own, a land of corn and good wine, a land of bread and vineyards. Do not let Hezekiah delude you by saying: Yahweh will save us. Has any god of any nation been able to save his country from the king of Assyria’s clutches? Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Where are the national gods of Samaria? Did they save Samaria from my clutches? Of all the national gods, which ones have saved their countries from my clutches, that Yahweh should be able to save Jerusalem from my clutches?’”.</p>

<p>They, however, kept quiet and said nothing in reply, since the king had given the order, “You are not to answer him”. The master of the palace, Eliakim son of Hilkiah, Shebna the secretary and the herald Joah son of Asaph, with their clothes torn, went to Hezekiah and reported what the cupbearer-in-chief had said.</p>

<h4>The prophet Isaiah is consulted (37:1–7)</h4>

<p>On hearing this, King Hezekiah tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and went to the Temple of Yahweh. He sent Eliakim master of the palace, Shebna the secretary and the elders of the priests, wearing sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz. They said to him, “This is what Hezekiah says, ‘Today is a day of suffering, of punishment, of disgrace. Children come to birth and there is no strength to bring them forth. May Yahweh your God hear the words of the cupbearer-in-chief whom his master, the king of Assyria, has sent to insult the living God, and may Yahweh your God punish the words he has heard! Offer your prayer for the remnant still left’”.</p>

<p>When King Hezekiah’s ministers came to Isaiah, he said to them, “Say to your master, ‘Yahweh says this: Do not be afraid of the words which you have heard or the blasphemies which the king of Assyria’s minions have uttered against me. Look, I am going to put a spirit in him and, on the strength of a rumour, he will go back to his own country, and in that country I shall make him fall by the sword’”.</p>

<h4>The cupbearer returns to his master (37:8–9a)</h4>

<p>The cupbearer turned about and rejoined the king of Assyria, who was then attacking Libnah, the cupbearer having learnt that the king had already left Lachish on hearing that Tirhakah king of Cush was on his way to attack him.</p> 

<h4>Second account of Sennacherib’s activities (37:9b–20)</h4>

<p>Sennacherib again sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, “Tell Hezekiah king of Judah this, ‘Do not let your God on whom you are relying deceive you with the promise: Jerusalem will not fall into the king of Assyria’s clutches. You have learnt by now what the kings of Assyria have done to all the other countries, putting them under the curse of destruction. Are you likely to be saved? Did the gods of the nations whom my ancestors devastated save them-Gozan, Haran, Rezeph and the Edenites who were in Tel Basar? Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of Lair, of Sepharvaim, of Hena, of Ivvah?’”.</p>

<p>Hezekiah took the letter from the messengers’ hands and read it; he then went up to the Temple of Yahweh and spread it out before Yahweh. Hezekiah said this prayer in the presence of Yahweh, “Yahweh Sabaoth, God of Israel, enthroned on the winged creatures, you alone are God of all the kingdoms of the world, you made heaven and earth. Give ear, Yahweh, and listen; open your eyes, Yahweh, and see! Hear the words of Sennacherib, who has sent to insult the living God. It is true, Yahweh, that the kings of Assyria have destroyed all the nations (and their countries); they have thrown their gods on the fire, for these were not gods but human artefacts — wood and stone — and hence they have destroyed them. But now, Yahweh our God, save us from his clutches, I beg you, and let all the kingdoms of the world know that you alone are God, Yahweh”.</p>

<h4>Isaiah intervenes (37:21–29)</h4>

<p>Isaiah son of Amoz then sent the following message to Hezekiah, “Yahweh, God of Israel, says this, ‘In answer to the prayer which you have addressed to me about Sennacherib king of Assyria. Here is the pronouncement which Yahweh has made about him:</p>

<h4>Sennacherib is punished (37:36–38)</h4>

<p>That same night the angel of Yahweh went out and struck down a hundred and eighty-five thousand men in the Assyrian camp. In the early morning when it was time to get up, there they lay, so many corpses.</p>

<p>Sennacherib struck camp and left; he returned home and stayed in Nineveh. One day when he was worshipping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him down with the sword and escaped into the territory of Ararat. His son Esarhaddon succeeded him.</p>

<h4>The illness and cure of Hezekiah (38:1–6, 21–22, 7–8)</h4>

<p>About then, Hezekiah fell ill and was at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz came and said to him, “Yahweh says this, ‘Put your affairs in order, for you are going to die, you will not live’”.</p>

<p>Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and addressed this prayer to Yahweh, “Ah, Yahweh, remember, I beg you, that I have behaved faithfully and with sincerity of heart in your presence and done what you regard as right”. And Hezekiah shed many tears.</p>

<p>Then the word of Yahweh came to Isaiah, “Go and say to Hezekiah, ‘Yahweh, the God of your ancestor David, says this: I have heard your prayer and seen your tears. I shall cure you: in three days’ time you will go up to the Temple of Yahweh. I shall add fifteen years to your life. I shall save you and this city from the king of Assyria’s clutches and defend this city for my sake and my servant David’s sake’”.</p>

<p>“Bring a fig poultice”, Isaiah said, “apply it to the ulcer and he will recover”.</p>

<p>Hezekiah said, “What is the sign to tell me that I shall be going up to the Temple of Yahweh?”</p>

<p>“Here”, Isaiah replied, “is the sign from Yahweh that he will do what he has said. Look, I shall make the shadow cast by the declining sun on the steps — the steps to Ahaz’s roof-room — go back ten steps”. And the sun went back the ten steps by which it had declined.</p>

<h4>The Babylonian embassy (39:1–8)</h4>

<p>At that time, the king of Babylon, Merodach-Baladan son of Baladan, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he had heard of his illness and his recovery. Hezekiah was delighted at this and showed the ambassadors his entire treasury, the silver, gold, spices, precious oil, his armoury too, and everything to be seen in his storehouses. There was nothing in his palace or in his whole domain that Hezekiah did not show them.</p>

<p>The prophet Isaiah then came to King Hezekiah and asked him, “What have these men said, and where have they come to you from?”.</p>

<p>Hezekiah answered, “They have come from a distant country, from Babylon”.</p>

<p>Isaiah said, “What have they seen in your palace?”.</p>

<p>“They have seen everything in my palace”, Hezekiah answered. “There is nothing in my storehouses that I have not shown them”.</p>

<p>Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Listen to the word of Yahweh Sabaoth, ‘The days are coming when everything in your palace, everything that your ancestors have amassed until now, will be carried off to Babylon. Not a thing will be left’, Yahweh says. ‘Sons sprung from you, sons begotten by you, will be abducted to be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon’”.</p>

<p>Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “This word of Yahweh that you announce is reässuring”, for he was thinking, “There is going to be peace and security during my lifetime”.</p>

<h4>The fatuity of idols (44:9–20)</h4>

<p>The makers of idols are all nothingness; the works they delight in serve no purpose. And these are the witness against them: they see nothing, they know nothing; and so they will be put to shame. Who ever fashioned a god or cast an image without hope of gain? Watch how all its devotees will be put to shame, and the men who made it too, who are only human. Let them all assemble, let them stand forward and feel both fear and shame!</p>

<p>The blacksmith makes an axe over the charcoal, beats it into shape with a hammer, works on it with his strong arm. Then he feels hungry and his strength deserts him; having drunk no water, he is exhausted.</p>

<p>The wood carver takes his measurements, outlines the image with chalk, executes it with the chisel, following the outline with a compass. He makes it look like a human being, with human standards of beauty, so that it can reside in a house. He has cut down cedars, has selected an oak and a terebinth which he has grown for himself among the trees in the forest and has planted a pine tree which the rain has nourished. Once it is suitable to burn, he takes some of it to warm himself; having kindled it, he bakes bread. But he also makes a god and worships it; he makes an idol from it and bows down before it. Half of it he burns on the fire, over this half he roasts meat, eats it and is replete; at the same time he warms himself and says, “Ah, how warm I am, watching the flames!”. With the remainder he makes a god, his idol, bows down before it, worships it and prays to it. “Save me”, he says, “for you are my god”.</p>

<p>They know nothing, they understand nothing, since their eyes are incapable of seeing and their hearts of reflecting. Not one of them looks into his heart, not one of them has the knowledge and wit to think, “I burned half of it on the fire and cooked food over the embers. Am I right to make something disgusting out of what is left? Am I right to bow down before a block of wood?”.</p>

<p>He hankers after ashes, his deluded heart has led him astray; he will not save himself, he will not think, “What I have in my hand is nothing but a lie!”.</p>

	<span>he hid me in the shadow of his hand.</span><br />
	<span>He made me into a sharpened arrow</span><br />

	<span>I have exhausted myself for nothing, to no purpose”.</span><br />
	<span>Yet all the while my cause was with Yahweh</span><br />
	<span>and my reward with my God.</span><br />
	<span>And now Yahweh has spoken,</span><br />
	<span>who formed me in the womb to be his servant,</span><br />
	<span>to bring Jacob back to him</span><br />

<h4>Meditation on the history of Israel (63:7–64:11)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>I shall recount Yahweh’s acts of faithful love,</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh’s praises,</span><br />
		<span>in return for all that Yahweh has done for us,</span><br />
		<span>for his great kindness to the House of Israel,</span><br />
		<span>for all that he has done in his mercy,</span><br />
		<span>for the abundance of his acts of faithful love.</span>
	</p>

	<p class="poem">
		<span>For he said, “Truly they are my people,</span><br />
		<span>children who will not betray me”,</span><br />
		<span>and he became their Saviour.</span><br />
		<span>In all their troubles,</span><br />
		<span>it was no messenger or angel</span><br />
		<span>but his presence that saved them.</span><br />
		<span>In his love and pity</span><br />
		<span>he himself redeemed them,</span><br />
		<span>lifted them up and carried them</span><br />
		<span>throughout the days of old.</span><br />
		<span>But they rebelled</span><br />
		<span>and vexed his holy Spirit.</span><br />
		<span>Then he became their enemy</span><br />
		<span>and himself waged war on them.</span><br />
		<span>But he called the past to mind,</span><br />
		<span>Moses his servant.</span><br />
		<span>Where is he who saved them from the sea,</span><br />
		<span>the Shepherd of his flock?</span><br />
		<span>Where was he who put</span><br />
		<span>his holy Spirit among them,</span><br />
		<span>whose glorious arm led the way</span><br />
		<span>by Moses’ right hand?</span><br />
		<span>Who divided the waters before them</span><br />
		<span>to win himself everlasting renown,</span><br />
		<span>who led them through the depths</span><br />
		<span>as easily as a horse through the desert?</span><br />
		<span>They stumbled as little</span><br />
		<span>as cattle going down to the plain.</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh’s Spirit led them to rest.</span><br />
		<span>This was how you guided your people</span><br />
		<span>to win yourself glorious renown.</span>
	</p>

	<p class="poem">
		<span>Look down from heaven and see</span><br />
		<span>from your holy and glorious dwelling.</span><br />
		<span>Where is your zeal and your might?</span><br />

		<span>your mercy to me, to be restrained?</span><br />
		<span>After all, you are our Father.</span><br />
		<span>If Abraham will not own us,</span><br />
		<span>if Israel will not acknowledge us,</span><br />
		<span>you, Yahweh, are our Father,</span><br />
		<span>“Our Redeemer” is your name from of old.</span><br />
		<span>Why, Yahweh, do you let us wander from your ways</span><br />
		<span>and let our hearts grow too hard to fear you?</span><br />
		<span>Return, for the sake of your servants,</span><br />
		<span>the tribes of your heritage.</span><br />
		<span>Your holy people have owned it for so short a time,</span><br />
		<span>our enemies have trampled on your sanctuary.</span><br />

	<p class="poem">
		<span>Oh, that you would tear the heavens open and come down</span><br />

		<span>There is no one to invoke your name,</span><br />

		<span>And yet, Yahweh, you are our Father;</span><br />
		<span>we the clay and you our potter,</span><br />
		<span>all of us are the work of your hands.</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh, do not let your anger go too far</span><br />

		<span>Look, please, we are all your people;</span><br />
		<span>your holy cities have become a desert,</span><br />

		<span>Jerusalem a wasteland.</span><br />
		<span>Our holy and glorious Temple,</span><br />
		<span>in which our ancestors used to praise you,</span><br />
		<span>has been burnt to the ground;</span><br />
		<span>all our delight lies in ruins.</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh, can you restrain yourself at all this?</span><br />
		<span>Will you stay silent and afflict us beyond endurance?</span>

<h4>The coming judgement (65:1–25)</h4>
	
<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>I have let myself be approached by those who did not consult me,</span><br />
		<span>I have let myself be found by those who did not seek me.</span><br />
		<span>I said, “Here I am, here I am!”,</span><br />
		<span>to a nation that did not invoke my name.</span><br />
		<span>Each day I stretched out my hands</span><br />
		<span>to a rebellious people</span><br />
		<span>who follow a way which is not good,</span><br />
		<span>as the fancy takes them;</span><br />
		<span>a people constantly provoking me to my face</span><br />
		<span>by sacrificing in gardens,</span><br />
		<span>burning incense on bricks,</span><br />
		<span>living in tombs,</span><br />
		<span>spending the night in dark corners,</span><br />
		<span>eating the meat of pigs,</span><br />
		<span>putting unclean foods on their plates.</span><br />
		<span>“Keep your distance”, they say,</span><br />
		<span>“do not touch me, lest my sanctity come near you!”.</span><br />
		<span>Such words are like stifling smoke to me,</span><br />
		<span>an ever-burning fire.</span><br />
		<span>Look, it is inscribed before me:</span><br />
		<span>I shall not be silent until I have repaid them,</span><br />
		<span>repaid them in full,</span><br />
		<span>punished your guilt and your ancestors’ guilt together,</span><br />
		<span>Yahweh declares.</span><br />
		<span>For having burnt incense on the mountains</span><br />
		<span>and insulted me on the hills,</span><br />
		<span>I shall pay them back in full for what they have done.</span>
	</p>

	<p class="poem">
		<span>Yahweh says this:</span><br />
		<span>As when a bunch of grapes is found still to have juice in it,</span><br />
		<span>people say, “Do not destroy it,</span><br />
		<span>for it contains a blessing”,</span><br />
		<span>so I shall act for my servants’ sake,</span><br />
		<span>I shall not destroy them all.</span><br />
		<span>I shall produce descendants from Jacob</span><br />
		<span>and heirs to my mountains from Judah,</span><br />
		<span>my chosen ones will own them</span><br />
		<span>and my servants will live there.</span><br />
		<span>Sharon will be a pasture for flocks,</span><br />
		<span>the Valley of Achor a feeding ground for cattle,</span><br />
		<span>for those of my people who have sought me.</span><br />
		<span>But as for those of you who abandon Yahweh,</span><br />
		<span>who forget my holy mountain,</span><br />
		<span>who lay the table for Gad,</span><br />
		<span>who fill cups of mixed wine for Meni,</span><br />
		<span>you I shall destine to the sword</span><br />
		<span>and all of you will stoop to be slaughtered,</span><br />
		<span>because I called and you would not answer,</span><br />
		<span>I spoke and you would not listen;</span><br />
		<span>you have done what I consider evil,</span><br />
		<span>you chose to do what displeases me.</span><br />
		<span>Therefore Lord Yahweh says this:</span><br />
		<span>You will see my servants eating</span><br />
		<span>while you go hungry;</span><br />
		<span>you will see my servants drinking</span><br />
		<span>while you go thirsty;</span><br />
		<span>you will see my servants rejoicing</span><br />
		<span>while you are put to shame;</span><br />
		<span>you will hear my servants shouting for joy of heart,</span><br />
		<span>while you shriek for sorrow of heart</span><br />
		<span>and howl with a broken spirit.</span><br />
		<span>And you will leave your name behind as a curse for my chosen ones,</span><br />
		<span>“May Lord Yahweh strike you dead!”.</span><br />
		<span>But to his servants he will give another name.</span><br />
		<span>Whoëver blesses himself on earth will bless himself by the God of truth,</span><br />
		<span>and whoëver swears an oath on earth will swear by the God of truth,</span><br />
		<span>for past troubles will be forgotten</span><br />
		<span>and hidden from my eyes.</span><br />
		<span>For look, I am going to create new heavens and a new earth,</span><br />
		<span>and the past will not be remembered</span><br />
		<span>and will come no more to mind.</span><br />
		<span>Rather be joyful, be glad for ever</span><br />
		<span>at what I am creating,</span><br />
		<span>for look, I am creating Jerusalem to be “Joy”</span><br />
		<span>and my people to be “Gladness”.</span><br />
		<span>I shall be joyful in Jerusalem</span><br />
		<span>and I shall rejoice in my people.</span><br />
		<span>No more will the sound of weeping be heard there,</span><br />
		<span>nor the sound of a shriek;</span><br />
		<span>never again will there be an infant there who lives only a few days,</span><br />
		<span>nor an old man who does not run his full course;</span><br />
		<span>for the youngest will die at a hundred,</span><br />
		<span>and at a hundred the sinner will be accursed.</span><br />
		<span>They will build houses and live in them,</span><br />
		<span>they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.</span><br />
		<span>They will not build for others to live in,</span><br />
		<span>or plant for others to eat;</span><br />
		<span>for the days of my people will be like the days of a tree,</span><br />
		<span>and my chosen ones will themselves use what they have made.</span><br />
		<span>They will not toil in vain,</span><br />
		<span>nor bear children destined to disaster,</span><br />
		<span>for they are the race of Yahweh’s blessed ones</span><br />
		<span>and so are their offspring.</span><br />
		<span>Thus, before they call I shall answer,</span><br />
		<span>before they stop speaking I shall have heard.</span><br />
		<span>The wolf and the young lamb will feed together,</span><br />
		<span>the lion will eat hay like the ox,</span><br />
		<span>and dust be the serpent’s food.</span><br />
		<span>No hurt, no harm will be done</span><br />
		<span>on all my holy mountain,</span><br />

<h4>An eschatological discourse (66:18–24)</h4>
	
<p>I am coming to gather every nation and every language. They will come to witness my glory. I shall give them a sign and send some of their survivors to the nations: to Tarshish, Put, Lud, Meshech, Tubal and Javan, to the distant coasts and islands that have never heard of me or seen my glory. They will proclaim my glory to the nations, and from all the nations they will bring all your brothers as an offering to Yahweh, on horses, in chariots, in litters, on mules and on camels, to my holy mountain, Jerusalem, Yahweh says, like Israelites bringing offerings in clean vessels to Yahweh’s house. And some of them I shall make into priests and Levites, Yahweh says.</p>

<p>For as the new heavens and the new earth I am making will endure before me, declares Yahweh, so will your race and your name endure.</p>
