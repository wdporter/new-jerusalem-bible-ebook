<h4>Title (1:1)</h4>

<p>The charge that Habakkuk the prophet received in a vision.</p>

<h2 id="i">I: Dialogue Between the Prophet and his God (1:2–2:4)</h2>

<h4>First complaint of the prophet: lawlessness prevails (1:2–4)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>How long, Yahweh, am I to cry for help</span><br />
	<span>while you will not listen;</span><br />
	<span>to cry, “Violence!”. in your ear</span><br />
	<span>while you will not save?</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Why do you make me see wrong-doing,</span><br />
	<span>why do you countenance oppression?</span><br />
	<span>Plundering and violence confront me,</span><br />
	<span>contention and discord flourish.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>And so the law loses its grip</span><br />
	<span>and justice never emerges,</span><br />
	<span>since the wicked outwits the upright</span><br />
	<span>and so justice comes out perverted.</span>
</p>

<h4>First answer: the Chaldaeans as instrument of God’s justice (1:5–11)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Cast your eyes over the nations, look,</span><br />
	<span>and be amazed, astounded.</span><br />
	<span>For I am doing something in your own days</span><br />
	<span>which you will not believe if you are told of it.</span><br />
	<span>For look, I am stirring up the Chaldaeans,</span><br />
	<span>that fierce and fiery nation</span><br />
	<span>who march miles across country</span><br />
	<span>to seize the homes of others.</span><br />
	<span>They are dreadful and awesome,</span><br />
	<span>a law and authority to themselves.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Their horses are swifter than leopards,</span><br />
	<span>fiercer than wolves at night;</span><br />
	<span>their horsemen gallop on,</span><br />
	<span>their horsemen advance from afar,</span><br />
	<span>swooping like an eagle anxious to feed.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>They are all bent on violence,</span><br />
	<span>their faces scorching like an east wind;</span><br />
	<span>they scoop up prisoners like sand.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>They scoff at kings,</span><br />
	<span>they despise princes.</span><br />
	<span>They make light of all fortresses:</span><br />
	<span>they heap up earth and take them.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Then the wind changes and is gone …</span><br />
	<span>Guilty is he who makes his strength his god.</span>
</p>

<h4>Second complaint of the prophet: the tyranny of the conqueror (1:12–17)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Surely you, Yahweh, are from ancient times,</span><br />
	<span>my holy God, who never dies!</span><br />
	<span>Yahweh, you have appointed him to execute judgement;</span><br />
	<span>O Rock, you have set him firm to punish.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Your eyes are too pure to rest on evil,</span><br />
	<span>you cannot look on at oppression.</span><br />
	<span>Why do you look on at those who play the traitor,</span><br />
	<span>why say nothing while the wicked swallows someöne more upright than himself?</span><br />
	<span>Why treat people like fish of the sea,</span><br />
	<span>like gliding creatures who have no leader?</span><br />
	<span>They haul them all up on their hook,</span><br />
	<span>they catch them in their net,</span><br />
	<span>they sweep them up in their dragnet</span><br />
	<span>and then make merry and rejoice.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>And so they offer a sacrifice to their net,</span><br />
	<span>and burn incense to their dragnet,</span><br />
	<span>for by these they get a rich living</span><br />
	<span>and live off the fat of the land.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Are they to go on emptying their net unceasingly,</span><br />
	<span>slaughtering the nations without pity?</span>
</p>

<h4>Second answer: the upright will live through faithfulness (2:1–4)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>I shall stand at my post,</span><br />
	<span>I shall station myself on my watch-tower,</span><br />
	<span>watching to see what he will say to me,</span><br />
	<span>what answer he will make to my complaints.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Then Yahweh answered me and said,</span><br />
	<span>“Write the vision down,</span><br />
	<span>inscribe it on tablets</span><br />
	<span>to be easily read.</span><br />
	<span>For the vision is for its appointed time,</span><br />
	<span>it hastens towards its end and it will not lie;</span><br />
	<span>although it may take some time, wait for it,</span><br />
	<span>for come it certainly will before too long.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>“You see, anyone whose heart is not upright will succumb,</span><br />
	<span>but the upright will live through faithfulness”.</span>
</p>

<h2 id="ii">II: Curses on the Oppressor (2:5–20)</h2>

<h4>Prelude (2:5–6a)</h4>
<p class="poem">
	<span>Now, surely, wealth is treacherous!</span><br />
	<span>He is arrogant, for ever on the move,</span><br />
	<span>with appetite as large as Sheol</span><br />
	<span>and as insatiable as Death,</span><br />
	<span>gathering in all the nations,</span><br />
	<span>and making a harvest of all peoples.</span><br />
	<span>Are not the peoples all bound to satirise</span><br />
	<span>and make up cryptic riddles about him?</span><br />
	<span>As for instance:</span>
</p>

<h4>Five imprecations (2:6b–20)</h4>

<h5>I</h5>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Disaster to anyone who amasses goods not his</span><br />
	<span>(for how long?)</span><br />
	<span>and to anyone who weighs himself down with goods taken in pledge!</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Will not your creditors suddenly stand up,</span><br />
	<span>will not those who make you shiver wake up,</span><br />
	<span>and you will fall a prey to them?</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Since you have plundered many nations,</span><br />
	<span>all the nations that remain will plunder you,</span><br />
	<span>because of the bloodshed and violence done to the country,</span><br />
	<span>to the city and to all who live in it.</span>
</p>

<h5>II</h5>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Disaster to anyone who amasses ill-gotten gains for his house,</span><br />
	<span>so as to fix his nest on high</span><br />
	<span>and so evade the reach of misfortune!</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>You have conspired to bring shame on your house:</span><br />
	<span>by overthrowing many peoples</span><br />
	<span>you have worked your own ruin.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>For the very stone will protest from the wall,</span><br />
	<span>and the beam will respond from the framework.</span>
</p>

<h5>III</h5>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Disaster to anyone who builds a town with bloodshed</span><br />
	<span>and founds a city on wrong-doing!</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Is it not thanks to Yahweh Sabaoth</span><br />
	<span>that the peoples’ toil is fuel for the fire,</span><br />
	<span>and the nations’ labour came to nothing?</span>
</p>

<p class="poem" style="font-style:italic">
	<span>But the earth will be full of the knowledge of the glory of Yahweh</span><br />
	<span>as the waters cover the depths of the sea.</span>
</p>

<h5>IV</h5>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Disaster to anyone who makes his neighbours drink,</span><br />
	<span>pouring out his poison until they are drunk,</span><br />
	<span>so that he can see them naked!</span><br />
	<span>You are full of shame, not glory!</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Your turn now to drink and show your foreskin.</span><br />
	<span>The cup in Yahweh’s right hand comes round to you,</span><br />
	<span>and disgrace will overshadow your glory.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>For the violence done to the Lebanon will overwhelm you</span><br />
	<span>and the massacre of animals will terrify you,</span><br />
	<span>because of the bloodshed and violence done to the country,</span><br />
	<span>to the city and to all who live in it.</span>
</p>

<h5>V</h5>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Disaster to anyone who says to the log, “Wake up!”,</span><br />
	<span>to the dumb stone, “On your feet!”.</span><br />
	<span>(This is the prophecy!)</span><br />
	<span>Look, he is encased in gold and silver,</span><br />
	<span>— but not a breath of life inside it!</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>What use is a sculpted image that a sculptor should make it?</span><br />
	<span>— a metal image, a lying instructor!</span><br />
	<span>And why does the image-maker put his trust in it,</span><br />
	<span>that he should make dumb idols?</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>But Yahweh is in his holy Temple:</span><br />
	<span>let the whole earth be silent before him.</span>
</p>

<h2 id="iii">III: Plea to Yahweh for Deliverance (3:1–19)</h2>

<h4>Title (3:1)</h4>

<p>A prayer of the prophet Habakkuk; tone as for dirges.</p>

<h4>Prayer (3:2)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Yahweh, I have heard of your renown;</span><br />
	<span>your work, Yahweh, inspires me with dread.</span><br />
	<span>Make it live again in our time,</span><br />
	<span>make it known in our time;</span><br />
	<span>in wrath remember mercy.</span>
</p>

<h4>Theophany: Yahweh’s approach (3:3–7)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Eloah comes from Teman,</span><br />
	<span>and the Holy One from Mount Paran.</span><span class="pause">Pause</span><br />
	<span>His majesty covers the heavens,</span><br />
	<span>and his glory fills the earth.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>His brightness is like the day,</span><br />
	<span>rays flash from his hands,</span><br />
	<span>that is where his power lies hidden.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Pestilence goes before him</span><br />
	<span>and Plague follows close behind.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>When he stands up, he makes the earth tremble,</span><br />
	<span>with his glance he makes the nations quake.</span><br />
	<span>And the eternal mountains are dislodged,</span><br />
	<span>the everlasting hills sink down,</span><br />
	<span>his pathway from of old.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>I saw the tents of Cushan in trouble,</span><br />
	<span>the tent-curtains of Midian shuddering.</span>
</p>

<h4>Yahweh’s battle (3:8–15)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Yahweh, are you enraged with the rivers,</span><br />
	<span>are you angry with the sea,</span><br />
	<span>that you should mount your chargers,</span><br />
	<span>your rescuing chariots?</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>You uncover your bow,</span><br />
	<span>and give the string its fill of arrows.<span class="pause">Pause</span></span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>You drench the soil with torrents;</span><br />
	<span>the mountains see you and tremble,</span><br />
	<span>great floods sweep by,</span><br />
	<span>the abyss roars aloud,</span><br />
	<span>lifting high its waves.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Sun and moon stay inside their dwellings,</span><br />
	<span>they flee at the light of your arrows,</span><br />
	<span>at the flash of your lightning-spear.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>In rage you stride across the land,</span><br />
	<span>in anger you trample the nations.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>You marched to save your people,</span><br />
	<span>to save your anointed one;</span><br />
	<span>you wounded the head of the house of the wicked,</span><br />
	<span>laid bare the foundation to the rock. <span class="pause">Pause</span></span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>With your shafts you pierced the leader of his warriors</span><br />
	<span>who stormed out with shouts of joy to scatter us,</span><br />
	<span>as if they meant to devour some poor wretch in their lair.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>With your horses you trampled through the sea,</span><br />
	<span>through the surging abyss!</span>
</p>

<h4>Conclusion: human fear and faith in God (3:16–19)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>When I heard, I trembled to the core,</span><br />
	<span>my lips quivered at the sound;</span><br />
	<span>my bones became disjointed</span><br />
	<span>and my legs gave way beneath me.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Calmly I await the day of anguish</span><br />
	<span>which is dawning on the people now attacking us.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>(For the fig tree is not to blossom,</span><br />
	<span>nor will the vines bear fruit,</span><br />
	<span>the olive crop will disappoint</span><br />
	<span>and the fields will yield no food;</span><br />
	<span>the sheep will vanish from the fold;</span><br />
	<span>no cattle in the stalls.)</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>But I shall rejoice in Yahweh,</span><br />
	<span>I shall exult in God my Saviour.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Yahweh my Lord is my strength,</span><br />
	<span>he will make my feet as light as a doe’s,</span><br />
	<span>and set my steps on the heights.</span>
</p>
