<hr />

<p>The sons of Reuben, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh had warriors, men armed with shield and sword who could handle the bow and were trained for war, to the number of forty-four thousand seven hundred and sixty fit for service. They made war on the Hagrites, on Jetur, Naphish and Nodab. God came to their help, and the Hagrites and all their allies fell into their hands, for they called on God as they fought, and because they put their trust in him he heard their prayer. Of their livestock they carried off fifty thousand camels, two hundred and fifty thousand sheep, two thousand donkeys and a hundred thousand people. Because the war was of God, the slaughter was great. They continued to live in their territory until the exile. </p>

fighting men, men of renown, heads of their families.

ICh 5:25 But since they were unfaithful to the God of their ancestors and prostituted themselves to the gods of
the peoples of the country whom God had destroyed before them,

ICh 5:26 the God of Israel roused the hostility of Pul, king of Assyria, that is the wrath of Tiglath-Pileser, king of
Assyria who deported them -- the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh -- taking them off to

ICh 9:1 Thus, all Israel’s official genealogies had been entered in the records of the kings of Israel and Judah

1 Ch 9: 1 8 and is still gatekeeper of the King’s Gate to the east. They were the gatekeepers of the camps of the
sons of Levi.

ICh 9:19 Shallum son of Kore, son of Ebiasaph, son of Korah, and his brothers belonging to his family, the
Korahites, were also in charge of the ministerial service as doorkeepers of the Tent, as their ancestors had been

1 Ch 9:20 Formerly, Phinehas son of Eleazar had been in charge of them -- Yahweh be with him!

ICh 9:21 Zechariah son of Meshelemiah was gatekeeper at the door of the Tent of Meeting.

ICh 9:22 All the keepers of the gate at the thresholds were picked men; there were two hundred and twelve of



them. They were grouped by relationship in their various villages. These were confirmed in office by David and
Samuel the seer because of their dependability.

ICh 9:23 They and their sons continued in charge as guards of the gates of the Temple of Yahweh, the house
of the Tent.

ICh 9:24 The gatekeepers were assigned to the four sides, east, west, north and south,

Temple, free of other responsibilities because they were on duty day and night.

ICh 9:34 Such were the chiefs of the levitical families, according to their relationship; these lived in Jerusalem.

<h3 id="iI">I: Saul, David’s Predecessor (9:35–10:14)</h3>

<h4>The ancestors of Saul (9:35–44)</h4>

<p>Jeiel father of Gibeon lived at Gibeon and his wife was called Maacah. His first-born son was Abdon, then Zur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadab, Gedor, Ahio, Zechariah and Mikloth. Mikloth fathered Shimeam. But they, unlike their brothers, lived at Jerusalem with their brothers. </p>

<p>Ner fathered Kish, Kish fathered Saul, Saul fathered Jonathan, Malchishua, Abinadab and Eshbaal. Son of Jonathan: Meribbaal. Meribbaal fathered Micah. Sons of Micah: Pithon, Melech, Tahrea. Ahaz fathered Jarah, Jarah fathered Alemeth, Azmaveth and Zimri; Zimri fathered Moza, Moza fathered Binea, Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son and Azel his son. Azel had six sons; their names were these: Azrikam his first-born, Ishmael, Sheariah, Obadiah, Hanan. These were the sons of Azel. </p>

<h4>Death of Saul (10:1–14)</h4>

<p>The Philistines gave battle to Israel and the Israelites, fleeing from the Philistines, fell and were slaughtered on Mount Gilboa. The Philistines bore down on Saul and his sons, and they killed Jonathan, Abinadab and Malchishua,
Saul’s sons. The fighting grew fiercer round Saul; the archers came upon him, and he was wounded by the archers. Saul then said to his armour-bearer, “Draw your sword and run me through with it. I do not want these uncircumcised men to come and make fun of me”. But his armour-bearer was very much afraid and would not do it. So Saul took his own sword and fell on it. His armour-bearer, seeing that Saul was dead, fell on his sword too and died with him. Thus died Saul, his three sons and his entire household together. When all the Israelites who were in the valley saw that the Israelites had been routed and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their towns and fled. The Philistines then came and occupied them. </p>

<p>When the Philistines came on the following day to strip the dead, they found Saul and his sons lying on Mount Gilboa. They stripped him and, taking his head and his armour, had these carried round the territory of the Philistines to proclaim the good news to their idols and their people. They placed his armour in the temple of their gods and nailed his head up in the temple of Dagon. </p>

<p>When all the inhabitants of Jabesh in Gilead heard everything that the Philistines had done to Saul, the warriors all set out and took the bodies of Saul and his sons away; they brought them to Jabesh and buried their bones under the tamarisk of Jabesh and fasted for seven days. </p>

<p>Thus died Saul in the infidelity of which he had been guilty towards Yahweh, in that he had not obeyed the word of Yahweh and because he had consulted a necromancer for guidance. He had not consulted Yahweh, who therefore caused his death and transferred the monarchy to David son of Jesse. </p>

<h2 id="ii">II: David, Founder of the Temple Liturgy (11:1–29:30)</h2>

<h3 id="iia">A: David the King (11:1–14:17)</h3>

<h4>David is anointed as king of Israel (11:1–3)</h4>

<p>All Israel then rallied to David at Hebron and said, “Look, we are your own flesh and bone. In days past when Saul was king, it was you who led Israel on its campaigns, and Yahweh your God promised you, ‘You are to shepherd my people Israel and be leader of my people Israel’”. So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and David made a pact with them in Yahweh’s presence at Hebron, and they anointed David as king of Israel, in accordance with the word of Yahweh through Samuel. </p>

<h4>The capture of Jerusalem (11:4–9)</h4>
<p>David and all Israel then marched on Jerusalem (that is to say, Jebus); the inhabitants of the territory were the Jebusites. The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, “You will not get in here”. But David captured the citadel of Zion, that is, the City of David. </p>

<p>David said, “The first man to kill a Jebusite will be made army commander and chief”. Joab son of Zeruiah was the first man to go up, and was made commander of the army. David went to live in the citadel, and that is how it came to be called the City of David. He then built a wall around the city, all around, beginning from the Millo, and Joab restored the rest of the city. Thus David grew stronger and stronger, for Yahweh Sabaoth was with him. </p>

<h4>David’s champions (11:10–47)</h4>

<p>These are David’s principal champions who joined forces with him in his kingdom, with all Israel, to make him king in accordance with the word of Yahweh concerning Israel. This is the roll of David’s champions: Jashobeam son of Hachmoni, head of the Three; he it was who brandished his spear over three hundred men whom he had killed at one time. Next, there was Eleazar son of Dodo, the Ahohite, one of the three champions. He was with David at Pas-Dammim when the Philistines mustered for battle there. There was a field full of barley there; and the people fled from the Philistines. And they took their stand in the middle of the field, held it and cut down the Philistines; and Yahweh brought about a great victory. </p>

<p>Three members of the Thirty went down to David at the rock near the Cave of Adullam while a company of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of the Rephaim. David was then in the stronghold and there was a Philistine garrison in Bethlehem. Longingly, David said, “If only someone would fetch me a drink of water from the well that stands by the gate at Bethlehem!”. At this the three champions, forcing their way through the Philistine camp, drew water from the well that stands by the gate of Bethlehem and, bringing it away, presented it to David. David, however, would not drink any of it, but poured it out as a libation to Yahweh. “God preserve me”, he said, “from doing such a thing! Am I to drink these men’s blood? For at the risk of their lives they brought it”. And so he would not drink. Such were the deeds of the three champions. </p>

<p>Abishai, brother of Joab, was leader of the Thirty. He it was who brandished his spear over three hundred men whom he had killed, winning himself a name among the Thirty. He was a most illustrious member of the Thirty and became their captain, but he was not equal to the Three. </p>

<p>Benaiah son of Jehoiada from Kabzeel was the hero of many exploits; he it was who slaughtered two formidable Moabites and, one snowy day, climbed down and slaughtered the lion in the storage-well. He also slaughtered an Egyptian, a man who was seven and a half feet tall. The Egyptian was armed with a spear in his hand like a weaver’s beam, but he took him on with a staff, tore the spear from the Egyptian’s hand and killed the man with it. Such were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada, winning him a name among the thirty champions. He was a most illustrious member of the Thirty, but he was not equal to the Three. David put him in command of his bodyguard. </p>

<p>The military champions were:</p>

<p>Of Saul’s fellow-tribesmen from Benjamin: Ahiezerthe leader, and Joash, sons of Hassemar of Gibeah, Jeziel and Peleth, sons of Azmaveth, Berachah and Jehu of Anathoth, Ishmaiah of Gibeon, one of the champions in the Thirty and commander of the Thirty, Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan and Jozabed of Gederoth, Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, Shephatiah of Hariph, Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezerand Jashobeam the Korahites, Joelah, Zebadiah, sons of Jeroham of Gedor. </p>

<p>From the Gadites, some good, capable fighting men defected and came to David at the stronghold in the desert — all skilled with shield and spear, fierce as lions and nimble as mountain gazelles. Ezerwasthe leader, Obadiah second, Eliab third, Mishmannah fourth, Jeremiah fifth, Attai sixth, Eliel seventh, Johanan eighth, Elzabad ninth, Jeremiah tenth, Machbannai eleventh. These Gadites were the leaders of the troops, the least of them a match for a hundred men and the greatest a match for a thousand. These were the men who once crossed the Jordan in the first month, when it had overflowed its banks and had driven out all the lowlanders to east and west. </p>

<p>Some of the Benjaminites and Judahites also joined David at the stronghold. When David came forward to meet them, he responded to them by saying, “If you have come to me with peaceful intent to help me, you will find me a good friend. But if it is to betray me to my enemies, seeing that I have done nothing wrong, may the God of our ancestors take note and condemn you”. </p>

<p>Then the Spirit invested Amasai the leader of the Thirty:</p> 

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
	<span>We are your men, David; with you, son of Jesse!</span><br />
	<span>Peace be with you, peace be with you; peace be with those who help you!</span><br />
	<span>For your God has helped you!</span><br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And David accepted them, including them among his more senior officers.</p>

<p>Some Manassehites also defected to David as he was setting out with the Philistines to fight Saul. But he did not help the Philistines because, after consultation, their chiefs sent him away, saying, “He will defect to his master Saul and it will cost us our heads!”. He was on his way to Ziklag when these Manassehites deserted to him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, Zillethai, chiefs of thousands in Manasseh. They helped David and his band, since they were all men of standing and became officers in the army. </p>

<p>Indeed reïnforcements reached David day after day, so that his camp grew into a camp of prodigious size. </p>

<h4>The warriors who assured David’s kingship (12:24–41)</h4>

<p>These are the numbers of fully armed men who joined David at Hebron to transfer Saul’s kingdom to him in accordance with the order of Yahweh: </p>

<p>Judahites carrying shield and spear: six thousand eight hundred fully armed warriors; </p>

<p>Simeonites; seven thousand one hundred champions valiant in war;</p>

<p>Levites: four thousand six hundred, in addition to Jehoiada, in command of the Aaronites, with three thousand seven hundred of these, Zadok, a young and valiant champion, and twenty-two commanders of his family; </p>

<p>Benjaminites: three thousand kinsmen of Saul, most of them hitherto in the service of the House of Saul; </p>

<p>Ephraimites: twenty thousand eight hundred valiant champions, men famous in their families;</p>

<p>of the half-tribe of Manasseh: eighteen thousand men assigned by name to go and proclaim David king; </p>

<p>Issacharites, sound judges of the times when Israel should take action, and the way to do it: two hundred chiefs and all their kinsmen under their command; </p>

<p>Zebulunites: fifty thousand men fit for service, marshalled for battle, with warlike weapons of every kind, staunch-hearted auxiliaries; </p>

<p>Naphtalites: a thousand commanders, and with them thirty-seven thousand men armed with shield and spear; </p>

<p>Danites: twenty-eight thousand six hundred men marshalled for battle;</p>

<p>Asherites: forty thousand men fit for service, marshalled for battle;</p>

<p>from Transjordan: a hundred and twenty thousand men of Reuben, Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh, with warlike weapons of every kind. </p>

<p>All these warriors in battle array came to David at Hebron with the firm determination of making David king of all Israel; and the rest of Israel, too, was of one mind in wanting to make David king. For three days they stayed there with David, eating and drinking, their fellow-tribesmen having made preparations for them; their neighbours too, from as far away as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, came bringing food on donkeys, camels, mules and oxen-supplies of flour, fig cakes, bunches of raisins, wine, oil, quantities of oxen and sheep — for there was joy in Israel. </p>

<h4>The ark brought back from Kiriath-Jearim (13:1–14)</h4>

<p>David conferred with the commanders of the thousands and the hundreds, in fact with all the leaders. Then, to the whole assembly of Israel, David said, “If this has your approval, and if Yahweh our God wills it so, we shall send messengers to the rest of our brothers throughout the territories of Israel, and also to the priests and Levites in their towns and pasture lands, bidding them join us. And then we will go and recover the ark of our God, for in the days of Saul we neglected to do it”. </p>

<p>The whole assembly agreed to this, because all the people thought that this was the right thing to do. So David summoned all Israel from the Shihor of Egypt to the Pass of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-Jearim. David and all Israel then went up to Baalah, to Kiriath-Jearim in Judah, from there to bring up the ark of God, which bears the title ‘Yahweh enthroned on the winged creatures’. They transported the ark of God out of Abinadab’s house on a new cart. Uzzah and Ahio drove the cart. David and all Israel danced before God with all their might, singing to the accompaniment of harps, lyres, tambourines, cymbals and trumpets. When they came to the threshing-floor of the Javelin, Uzzah reached out his hand to steady the ark, as the oxen were making it tilt. This roused Yahweh’s anger against Uzzah, and he struck him down because he had laid his hand on the Ark, and there he died before God. David resented Yahweh’s having broken out against Uzzah, and the place was given the name Perez-Uzzah, which it still has today. </p>

<p>That day David felt afraid of God. “How can I bring the ark of God to be with me?”, he said. So David did not take the ark with him into the City of David but had it put in the house of Obed-Edom of Gath. The ark of God remained with Obed-Edom, in his house, for three months, and Yahweh blessed Obed-Edom’s family and everything that belonged to him. </p>

<h4>David in Jerusalem, his palace, his children (14:1–7)</h4>

<p>Hiram king of Tyre sent envoys to David, with cedar wood, stone-cutters and carpenters, to build him a palace. David then knew that Yahweh had confirmed him as king of Israel and, for the sake of his people, had extended his sovereignty. </p>

<p>David took more wives in Jerusalem and fathered more sons and daughters. These are the names of the children born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, Elishama, Beeliada, Eliphelet. </p>

<h4>Victories over the Philistines (14:8–17)</h4>

<p>When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed as king of all Israel, they all invaded to seek him out. On hearing this, David marched out towards them. When the Philistines arrived, they deployed in the Valley of the Rephaim. David consulted God and asked, “Shall I attack the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my power?”. </p>

<p>Yahweh replied to him, “Attack! I shall deliver them into your power”. Accordingly, they went up to Baal-Perazim and there David defeated them. </p>

<p>David said, “Through me God has made a breach in my enemies, as though they had been breached by a flood”. This is why the place was given the name Baal-Perazim. They had left their gods behind there, and David ordered them to be burnt. </p>

<p>Again the Philistines deployed in the valley. David again consulted God, and God replied, “Do not attack them from the front; go round and engage them opposite the balsam trees. When you hear the sound of footsteps in the tops of the balsam trees, launch your attack, for that will be God going out ahead of you to defeat the Philistine army”. David did as God had ordered, and they beat the Philistine army from Gibeon to Gezer. </p>

<p>David’s fame then spread to every country, and Yahweh made him feared by every nation.</p>

<h3 id="iib">B: The Ark in the Citadel of David (15:1–20:8)</h3>

<h4>Preparations for moving the ark (15:1–24)</h4> 	

<p>After he had put up buildings for himself in the City of David, he prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it. David then said, “No one but the Levites should carry the ark of God, since Yahweh has chosen them to carry the ark of Yahweh and to minister to him for ever”. David then summoned all Israel to Jerusalem, to move the ark of Yahweh to the place which he had
prepared for it. David also called the sons of Aaron and the Levites together: of the sons of Kohath: Uriel the chief and his hundred and twenty kinsmen; of the sons of Merari: Asaiah the chief and his two hundred and twenty kinsmen; of the sons of Gershom: Joel the chief and his hundred and thirty kinsmen; of the sons of Elizaphan: Shemaiah the chief and his two hundred kinsmen; of the sons of Hebron: Eliel the chief and eighty kinsmen; of the sons of Uzziel: Amminadab the chief and his hundred and twelve kinsmen. </p>

<p>David then sent for the priests Zadok and Abiathar, and the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel and Amminadab. To them he said, “You are the heads of the levitical families. Sanctify yourselves, you and your kinsmen, so that you can move the ark of Yahweh, God of Israel, to the place which I have prepared for it. Because you were not there the first time, Yahweh our God broke out at us because we did not handle it properly”. So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves, to move the ark of Yahweh, God of Israel, and the Levites carried the ark of God with the shafts on their shoulders, as Moses had ordered in accordance with the word of Yahweh. </p>

<p>David also told the heads of the Levites to appoint their kinsmen as singers with the accompaniment of musical instruments, lyres, harps and cymbals to play joyfully. The Levites then appointed Heman son of Joel, Asaph son of Berechiah, one of his brothers, Ethan son of Kushaiah, one of their Merarite kinsmen; and with them their kinsmen of the second rank: Zechariah, Uzziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, and Obed-Edom and Jehiel the gatekeepers. The singers, Heman, Asaph and Ethan, were to play the bronze cymbals. Zechariah, Uzziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah and Benaiah were to play the lyre. Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jehiel and Azaziah, giving the beat, were to play the harp. Chenaniah, the levitical director of transport was in charge of the transport, being skilful at it. Berechiah and Elkanah were gatekeepers for the ark. The priests Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah and Eliezer blew trumpets before the ark of God, while Obed-Edom and Jehiah were also gatekeepers for the ark. </p>

<h4>The ark is brought to Jerusalem (15:25–16:3)</h4>

<p>David, the elders of Israel and the commanders of the thousands accordingly went, amid great rejoicing, to bring the ark of the covenant of Yahweh up from Obed-Edom’s house, and since God was helping the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams. David, all the Levites who carried the ark, the singers and Chenaniah, director of transport, wore cloaks of fine linen. David also wore a linen ephod. Thus, with war-cries and the sounding of the horn, the trumpets and the cymbals, and the music of lyres and harps, all Israel transported the ark of the covenant of Yahweh. Now, as the ark of the covenant of Yahweh entered the City of David, Michal daughter of Saul was watching from the window and, when she saw King David dancing and playing, the sight of him filled her with contempt. </p>

<p> They brought the ark of God in and put it inside the tent which David had erected for it, and brought burnt offerings and made communion sacrifices in God’s presence. And when David had finished making burnt offerings and communion sacrifices, he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh. To all the Israelites, both men and women, to each, he then distributed a loaf of bread, a portion of meat and a raisin cake. </p>

<h4>The service of the Levites before the ark (16:4–43)</h4>

<p>He appointed some of the Levites as ministers before the ark of Yahweh, to extol, glorify and praise Yahweh, God of Israel; first Asaph, second Zechariah, then Uzziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-Edom and Jeiel, who played the lyre and harp, while Asaph played the cymbals. The priests Benaiah and Jahaziel continually blew the trumpet before the ark of the covenant of God. On that day, David was the first to assign to Asaph and his kinsmen the giving of thanks to Yahweh: </p>

</blockquote>

<p>To which all the people said, “Amen, Alleluia!”.</p>

<p>There before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh David left Asaph and his kinsmen to maintain a permanent ministry before the ark as each day’s ritual required, and also Obed-Edom with his sixty-eight kinsmen. Obed-Edom son of Jeduthun, and Hosah were gatekeepers. </p>

<p>Zadok the priest and the priests, his kinsmen, he left before the dwelling of Yahweh on the high place at Gibeon to bring burnt offerings to Yahweh unfailingly, morning and evening, on the altar of burnt offering, and to carry out all that is written in the Law of Yahweh laid down for Israel. With them were Heman and Jeduthun and the rest of those who were chosen and assigned by name to give thanks to Yahweh, “for his faithful love lasts for ever”. With them were Heman and Jeduthun to play trumpets and cymbals, as well as instruments for accompanying sacred song. The sons of Jeduthun were in charge of the gates. </p>

<p>Then all the people went back to their homes, and David went back to bless his household.</p>

<h4>Nathan’s prophecy (17:1–15)</h4>

<p>It happened, once David had settled into his palace, that David said to the prophet Nathan, “Here am I living in a cedar-wood palace, while the ark of the covenant of Yahweh is under awnings”. </p>

<p>Nathan said to David, “Do whatever you have in mind, for God is with you”. </p>

<p>But that very night the word of God came to Nathan, as follows: </p>

<p>“Go and tell my servant David, ‘Yahweh says this: You must not build a temple for me to live in. I have never lived in a house from the day when I brought Israel out until today, but have kept travelling from tent to tent and from shelter to shelter. In all my travels with all Israel, did I say to any of the judges of Israel, whom I had commanded to shepherd my people: Why do you not build me a cedar-wood temple? This is what you must say to my servant David: Yahweh Sabaoth says this: I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, to be leader of my people Israel. I have been with you wherever you went; I have got rid of all your enemies for you. I am going to make your fame like that of the greatest men on earth. I am going to provide a place for my people Israel; I shall plant them there and there they will live and never be disturbed again; nor will they be oppressed by the wicked as they were in former times ever since I instituted judges to govern my people Israel; I shall subdue all your enemies. Yahweh moreöver tells you that he will build you a dynasty. And when your days are over and you have gone to join your ancestors, I shall appoint your heir — who will be one of your sons — to succeed you, and I shall make his sovereignty secure. He will build a temple for me and I shall make his throne secure for ever. I shall be his father and he will be my son, and I shall not withdraw my favour from him, as I withdrew
it from your predecessor. I shall set him over my temple and kingdom for ever and his throne will be for ever secure." </p> 

<p>Nathan related all these words and this whole revelation to David.</p>

<h4>David’s prayer (17:16–27)</h4>

<p>King David then went in, sat down in Yahweh’s presence and said: </p> 

<p>“Who am I, Yahweh God, and what is my lineage, that you have led me as far as this? Yet, to you, O God, this seemed too little, and now you extend your promises for your servant’s family into the distant future, making me see as it were a whole succession of men, and it is Yahweh God himself who raises it up. What more can David reply to you for the honour you have given to your servant? You yourself have singled out your servant. For your servant, and since you were so inclined, you have had the generosity to reveal all this greatness to come. Yahweh, there is no one like you, no God but you alone, as everything that we have heard confirms. Is there another people on earth like your people Israel, whom a god has proceeded to redeem, to make them his people and to make them famous and do for them great and terrible deeds, by driving out nations before your people, whom you redeemed from Egypt? — for you made your people Israel your own people for ever and you, Yahweh, became their God. </p>

<p>“Now, Yahweh, may the promise which you have made for your servant and as regards his family hold good for ever, and do as you have said. May it hold good, so your name will be exalted for ever and people will say, ‘Israel’s God is Yahweh Sabaoth; he is God for Israel’. Your servant David’s dynasty will be secure before you since you, my God, have disclosed to your servant that you are going to build him a dynasty. Hence, your servant has ventured to offer this prayer to you. Yes, Yahweh, you are God indeed, and you have made this generous promise to your servant. What is more, you have deigned to bless your servant’s dynasty, so that it may remain for ever before you; and since you, Yahweh, have blessed it, blessed will it be for ever”. </p>

<h4>David’s wars (18:1–13)</h4>

<p>After this David defeated the Philistines and subdued them. From the grip of the Philistines he wrested Gath and its dependencies. He also defeated the Moabites; the Moabites became David’s subjects and paid him tribute. </p>


<p>David also defeated Hadadezer king of Zobah, which lies in the direction of Hamath, when the latter mounted an expedition to assert his rule on the River Euphrates. David captured one thousand chariots, seven thousand charioteers and twenty thousand foot soldiers from him; David hamstrung all the chariot teams, keeping only a hundred of them. The Aramaeans of Damascus came to the help of Hadadezer king of Zobah, but David killed twenty-two thousand of the Aramaeans. David then imposed governors in Aram of Damascus, and the Aramaeans became David’s subjects and paid him tribute. Wherever David went, Yahweh gave him victory. David took the golden shields carried by Hadadezer’s guards and brought them to Jerusalem. From Tibhath and from Cun, towns belonging to Hadadezer, David captured a great quantity of bronze, with which Solomon made the bronze Sea, the pillars and the bronze implements. </p>

<p>When Tou king of Hamath heard that David had defeated the entire army of Hadadezer king of Zobah, he sent his son Hadoram to King David to greet him and to congratulate him on having made war on Hadadezer and on having defeated him, since Hadadezer was at war with Tou. He also sent all sorts of objects made of gold, silver and bronze, which King David also consecrated to Yahweh, as well as the silver and gold which he had levied from all the nations, from Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines and Amalek. </p>

<p>Abishai son of Zeruiah defeated the Edomites in the Valley of Salt — eighteen thousand of them. He stationed garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became David’s subjects. Wherever David went, Yahweh gave him victory. </p>

<h4>The administration of the kingdom (18:14–17)</h4>

<p>David ruled over all Israel, administering law and justice to all his people. Joab son of Zeruiah was in command of the army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was herald; Zadok son of Ahitub and Abiathar son of Ahimelech were priests; Shusha was secretary; Benaiah son of Jehoiada was in command of the Cherethites and Pelethites; David’s sons took first place after the king. </p>

<h4>David’s ambassadors are insulted (19:1–5)</h4>

<p>After this, when Nahash king of the Ammonites died and his son Hanun succeeded him, David thought, “I shall show Hanun son of Nahash the same faithful love as his father showed me”. And David sent representatives to offer him condolences over his father. </p>

<p>But when David’s representatives reached Hanun in the Ammonites’ country to present these condolences, the Ammonite leaders said to Hanun, “Do you really think David means to honour your father when he sends you messengers with sympathy? On the contrary, the reason why his representatives have come to you is to explore, overthrow and reconnoitre the country”. Whereüpon Hanun seized David’s representatives, shaved them, cut their clothes off half-way up, right by their buttocks, and sent them away. As soon as David was told how the men had been treated, he sent someone to meet them, since the men were overcome with shame. </p>

<p>“Stay in Jericho,” the king said, “until your beards have grown, and come back then”. </p>

<h4>The first Ammonite campaign (19:6–15)</h4>

<p>When the Ammonites realised that they had antagonised David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent a thousand talants of silver to hire chariots and cavalry from the Aramaeans of Upper Mesopotamia, of Maacahand of Zobah. They hired thirty-two thousand chariots and the king of Maacah with his people, who came and encamped before Medeba, while the Ammonites, having left their towns and mustered, were advancing to the war. When David heard this, he sent Joab with the whole army, the champions. The Ammonites marched out and drew up their line of battle at the city gate, while the kings who had come kept their distance in the open country. Joab, seeing that he had to fight on two fronts, to his front and to his rear, chose the best of Israel’s picked men and drew them up in line facing the Aramaeans. He entrusted the rest of the army to his brother Abishai, and drew them up in line facing the Ammonites. “If the Aramaeans prove too strong for me,” he said, “you must come to my help; if the Ammonites prove too strong for you, I shall come to yours. Be brave and let us fight valiantly, for the sake of our people and for the cities of our God! And let Yahweh dispose as he thinks fit!”. Joab and the force with him joined battle with the Aramaeans, who fled at his onslaught. When the Ammonites saw that the Aramaeans had fled, they too fled from his brother Abishai and withdrew into the city. Joab then returned to Jerusalem. </p>

<h4>Victory over the Ammonites (19:16–19)</h4>

<p>The Aramaeans, realising that Israel had got the better of them, sent messengers and mobilised the Aramaeans living on the other side of the River, with Shophach, commander of Hadadezer’s army, at their head. David, being informed of this, mustered all Israel, crossed the Jordan, made contact with them and took up position near them. David drew up his line of battle facing the Aramaeans, who then engaged him. But the Aramaeans fled from Israel, and David killed seven thousand of their chariot teams and forty thousand men; and also Shophach, the commander of the army. When Hadadezer’s vassals saw that Israel had got the better of them, they made peace with David and became his subjects. The Aramaeans were unwilling to give any more help to the Ammonites. </p>

<h4>The second Ammonite campaign (20:1–3)</h4>

<p>At the turn of the year, at the time when kings go campaigning, Joab led out the troops and, having ravaged the Ammonites’ territory, proceeded to lay siege to Rabbah. David, however, remained in Jerusalem. Joab reduced Rabbah and dismantled it. David took the crown off Milcom’s head and found that it weighed a talant of gold, and in it was set a precious stone which went on David’s head instead. He carried off great quantities of booty from the city. And he expelled its inhabitants, setting them to work with saws, iron picks and axes. David treated all the Ammonite towns in the same way. David and all the people then returned to Jerusalem. </p>

<h4>Various exploits against the Philistines (20:4–8)</h4>

<p>After this war broke out with the Philistines at Gezer. This was when Sibbecai of Hushah killed Sippai, one of the Rephaim, and the Philistines were subdued. </p>

<p>Again, war with the Philistines broke out, and Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi brother of Goliath of Gath, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam. </p>

<p>There was further warfare at Gath, where there was a man of huge stature with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in all. He too was a son of Rapha. When he defied Israel, Jonathan son of Shimea, brother of David cut him down. </p>

<p>These men were sons of Rapha in Gath and fell at the hands of David and his guards.</p>

<h3 id="iic">C: Prelude to the Building of the Temple (21:1–29:30)</h3>

<h4>The census (21:1–6)</h4>

<p>Satan took his stand against Israel and incited David to take a census of Israel. David said to Joab and the people’s princes, “Go, and take a census of Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, then bring it back to me and let me know the total”. </p>

<p>Joab replied, “May Yahweh multiply his people to a hundred times what they are today! But my lord king, are they not all my lord’s servants in any case? Why should my lord insist on this? Why should he involve Israel in guilt?”. But the king enforced his order on Joab, and Joab set out, travelled throughout all Israel, and then returned to Jerusalem. Joab gave David the census results for the people: all Israel had eleven hundred thousand men who could wield a sword; Judah had four hundred and seventy thousand men who could wield a sword. Joab had found the king’s command so distasteful that he did not include Levi and Benjamin. </p>

<h4>The pestilence. God’s forgiveness (21:7–17)</h4>

<p>God looked with displeasure on this and punished Israel in consequence. David then said to God, “I have committed a grave sin by doing this. But now I beg you to forgive your servant for this fault, for I have acted very foolishly”. </p>

<p>Yahweh then spoke to Gad, David’s seer, “Go and say to David, ‘Yahweh says this: I offer you three things; choose which one of them I am to inflict on you’”. </p>

<p>So Gad went to David and said, “Yahweh says this, ‘Take your choice between three years of famine; or three months of disaster at the hands of your enemies, with your enemies’ sword overtaking you; or three days of Yahweh’s sword, an epidemic in the country, while the angel of Yahweh wreaks havoc throughout the territory of Israel’. Now decide how I am to answer him who sends me”. </p>

<p>David said to Gad, “I am very apprehensive. Better for me to fall into Yahweh’s hand, since his mercies are very great, than for me to fall into the hands of human enemies”. </p>

<p>So Yahweh unleashed an epidemic on Israel, and seventy thousand Israelites succumbed. Next, God sent the angel to Jerusalem to destroy it, but as he was about to destroy it, Yahweh looked down and felt sorry about the calamity; and he said to the destroying angel, “Enough now! Hold your hand!”. The angel of Yahweh was standing by the threshing-floor of Oman the Jebusite. David, raising his eyes, saw the angel of Yahweh standing between earth and heaven, a drawn sword in his hand stretched out towards Jerusalem. </p>

<p>David and the elders then put on sackcloth and fell on their faces, and David said to God, “Did I not order the people to be counted? I was the one who sinned and actually committed the wrong. But these, the flock, what have they done? Yahweh my God, let your hand lie heavy on me and on my family; but spare your people from the plague!”. </p>

<h4>The altar is built (21:18–22:1)</h4>

<p>The angel of Yahweh then ordered Gad to tell David that David should go up and erect an altar to Yahweh on the threshing-floor of Oman the Jebusite. So, at Gad’s bidding, given in Yahweh’s name, David went up. Oman had turned round and seen the angel, and he and his four sons with him had hidden. When David arrived Oman was threshing wheat. He looked up and saw David and came off the threshing-floor and prostrated himself on the ground at David’s feet. David then said to Oman, “Let me have the site of the threshing-floor, so that I can build an altar to Yahweh on it; let me have it at the full price — so that the plague may be lifted from the people”. </p>

<p>Oman said to David, “Take it, and let my lord the king do what he thinks fit. Look, I shall give you the oxen for burnt offerings, the threshing-sleds for the wood and the wheat for the oblation. I shall give everything”. </p>

<p>“No”, said King David to Oman, “I insist on buying it at the full price. I will not offer Yahweh what belongs to you or bring burnt offerings which have cost me nothing”. So David gave Oman six hundred shekels of gold by weight for the site. </p>

<p>There David built an altar to Yahweh and brought burnt offerings and peace offerings. He called on Yahweh, and Yahweh answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering. Then Yahweh ordered the angel to sheathe his sword. Whereüpon, seeing that Yahweh had answered him on the threshing-floor of Oman the Jebusite, David offered sacrifice there. The Dwelling which Moses had made in the desert and the altar of burnt offering were at that time on the high place at Gibeon, but David could not go there to consult God because he was terrified of the angel’s sword. </p>

<p>David then said, “This is to be the house of Yahweh God and this the altar of burnt offering for Israel”. </p>

<h4>Preparations for the building of the temple (22:2–19)</h4>

<p>David then gave orders for all foreigners in Israel to be rounded up, and appointed quarrymen to cut dressed stone for building the house of God. David also prepared great quantities of iron to make nails for the leaves of the doors and for the clamps, and more bronze than could be weighed, as well as innumerable cedar-wood logs, as the Sidonians and Tyrians had brought cedar logs to David in great quantities. </p>

<p>David then said, “My son Solomon is young and immature, and the house to be built for Yahweh must be superlatively fine, the most famous and splendid in any country. I shall now make the preparations for it”. And so, before he died, David made ample preparations. He then summoned his son Solomon and commanded him to build a house for Yahweh, God of Israel. “My son,” David said to Solomon, “my heart was set on building a house for the name of Yahweh my God. But the word of Yahweh came to me, ‘You have shed much blood and fought great wars; it is not for you to build a house for my name, since you have shed much blood in my sight on earth. Look, a son will be born to you. He will be a man of peace, and I shall give him peace from his enemies on all sides; for Solomon is to be his name, and in his days I shall give Israel peace and tranquillity. He must build a house for my name; he will be my son and I shall be his father, and I shall make the throne of his kingdom secure over Israel for ever’. Now, my son, may Yahweh be with you and give you success in building a house for Yahweh your God, as he has promised about you. And especially, may Yahweh give you discretion and discernment, may he give you his orders for Israel, so that you may observe the Law of Yahweh your God. Success will be yours, only if you observe the statutes and ordinances which Yahweh gave Moses as regulations for Israel. Be strong and stand fast, be fearless, be dauntless. Now, poor as I am, I have set aside for the house of Yahweh a hundred thousand talants of gold, a million talants of silver and more bronze and iron than can be weighed, there being so much. I have also provided timber and stone, to which you may add more. Furthermore, you have a large number of workmen, quarrymen, masons, carpenters and all sorts of craftsmen for every kind of work, while your gold and silver, bronze and iron will be beyond reckoning. Set to work, then, and may Yahweh be with you!”. </p>

<p>David then commanded all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon. “Has not Yahweh your God been with you and given you peace on all sides, having put the inhabitants of the country into my power and the country now having been subdued for Yahweh and his people? So now devote heart and soul to searching for Yahweh your God. Set to and build the sanctuary of Yahweh God, so that you can bring the ark of the covenant of Yahweh and the holy vessels of God into the house built for the name of Yahweh”. </p>
<hr />
ICh 23:1 When David had become old and full of days, he made his son Solomon king of Israel,

ICh 23:2 and then summoned all the leaders of Israel, with the priests and Levites.

ICh 23:3 A census was taken of those Levites thirty years old and upwards. On a count of heads, they
numbered thirty-eight thousand men;

1 Ch 23:4 twenty-four thousand were responsible for the service of the House of Yahweh, six thousand were
officials and judges,

1 Ch 23:5 four thousand were gatekeepers and four thousand praised Yahweh on the instruments which David
had made for praising him.

ICh 23:6 David then divided the Levites into classes: Gershon, Kohath and Merari.

ICh 23:7 Of the Gershonites there were Ladan and Shimei.

ICh 23:8 Sons of Ladan: Jehiel first, Zetham, Joel; three in all.

ICh 23:9 Sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel, Haran; three in all. These are the heads of families of Ladan.

ICh 23:10 Sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, Jeush, Beriah; these were the sons of Shimei; four in all.

ICh 23:1 1 Jahath was the eldest, Zizah the second, then Jeush and Beriah, who had not many children and
were reckoned as one family.

ICh 23:12 Sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, Uzziel; four in all.



ICh 23:13 Sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. Aaron was set apart to consecrate the things that were especially
holy, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense in the presence of Yahweh, to serve him and to bless in his name
for ever.

ICh 23:14 Moses, man of God, and his sons were reckoned with the tribe of Levi.

ICh 23:15 Sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.

ICh 23:16 Sons of Gershom: Shebuel, the first.

ICh 23:17 Of the sons of Eliezer, Rehabiah was the first. Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah
were very numerous.

ICh 23:18 Sons of Izhar: Shelomith, the first.

ICh 23:19 Sons of Hebron: Jeriah first, Amariah second, Jahaziel third, Jekameam fourth.

ICh 23:20 Sons of Uzziel: Micah first, Isshiah second.

ICh 23:21 Sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. Sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.

ICh 23:22 Eleazar died without sons, but he did have daughters, whom their cousins, the sons of Kish, married.
ICh 23:23 Sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, Jeremoth: three in all.

1 Ch 23:24 These were the sons of Levi by their families, the heads of families, and those registered by name,
individually; whoever was twenty years old or upwards had his function in the service of the Temple of Yahweh.
ICh 23:25 For David said, “Since Yahweh, God of Israel, has given rest to his people Israel and has taken up
residence in Jerusalem for ever,

ICh 23:26 the Levites need no longer carry the Dwelling or any of the objects required for its service”.

ICh 23:27 For, according to the last words of David, the Levites who had been registered were of twenty years
and upwards.

1 Ch 23:28 Their duty now is to help the sons of Aaron in the service of the House of Yahweh, in the care of the
courts and rooms, the purification of all the holy things, the work for the service of the House of God,

1 Ch 23:29 the loaves of permanent offering, the flour for the oblation, the wafers of unleavened bread, the pan-
baked materials, the unmixed materials and all measures of volume and length.

ICh 23:30 Furthermore, they have to be present every morning to give thanks and praise to Yahweh, and also
in the evening,

1 Ch 23:31 and at the bringing of every burnt offering to Yahweh on Sabbath, New Moon or solemn feast,
appearing regularly before Yahweh in accordance with the numbers required of them.

ICh 23:32 In serving the Temple of Yahweh they observe the ritual of the Tent of Meeting, the ritual of the
sanctuary and the ritual of their kinsmen, the sons of Aaron”.

ICh 24:1 Orders of the sons of Aaron: Sons of Aaron: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, Ithamar.

ICh 24:2 Nadab and Abihu died in their father’s lifetime leaving no children, so Eleazar and Ithamar filled the
office of priest.

ICh 24:3 With Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, David allocated them
according to the classification of their duties.

ICh 24:4 Since the sons of Eleazar were found to have more headmen than the sons of Ithamar, they allocated
sixteen heads of families to the sons of Eleazar and eight heads of families to the sons of Ithamar.

ICh 24:5 They allocated them by lot, both alike, there being religious officials and officials of God among the
sons of Eleazar, as among the sons of Ithamar.

ICh 24:6 The levitical scribe Shemaiah son of Nethanel, recorded them in the presence of the king, the leaders,
Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar and the heads of the priestly and levitical families, so that two
families were selected for Eleazar for each one selected for Ithamar.

ICh 24:7 The first lot fell to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,

ICh 24:8 the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,

ICh 24:9 the fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,

ICh 24:10 the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,

ICh 24:1 1 the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah,

ICh 24:12 the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,

ICh 24:13 the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Ishbaal,

ICh 24:14 the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,

ICh 24:15 the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez,

ICh 24:16 the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel,

ICh 24:17 the twenty-first to Jachin, the twenty-second to Gamul,

ICh 24:18 the twenty- third to Delaiah and the twenty-fourth to Maaziah.

ICh 24:19 These were their classifications for their duties when they entered the House of Yahweh in
accordance with their prescriptions laid down by Aaron their ancestor as Yahweh, God of Israel, had
commanded him.

1 Ch 24:20 As regards the rest of the sons of Levi: Of the sons of Amram: Shubael. Of the sons of Shubael:



Jehdeiah.

ICh 24:21 As regards Rehabiah, of the sons of Rehabiah: Isshiah, the first one.

1 Ch 24:22 Of the sons of Izhar: Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth: Jahath.

ICh 24:23 Of the sons of Hebron: Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.
1 Ch 24:24 The son of Uzziel was Micah; of the sons of Micah: Shamir.

1 Ch 24:25 The brother of Micah was Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah.

ICh 24:26 The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi; of his sons: Jaaziah his son.

ICh 24:27 The sons of Merari by his son Jaaziah were Shoham, Zaccurand Ibri.

1 Ch 24:28 Of Mahli, there was Eleazar who had no sons,

ICh 24:29 and Kish; and of the sons of Kish: Jerahmeel.

ICh 24:30 The sons of Mushi were Mahli, Eder and Jerimoth. These were the Levites according to families.

1 Ch 24:31 Like their kinsmen, the sons of Aaron, these heads of families, senior and junior alike, also drew lots
in the presence of King David, Zadok, Ahimelech, and the heads of the priestly and levitical families.

ICh 25:1 For the liturgy, David and the religious officials selected the sons of Asaph, of Heman and of
Jeduthun, who were to prophesy to the accompaniment of harps, lyres and cymbals. The list of ministrants for
this service was as follows:

1 Ch 25:2 Of the sons of Asaph: Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, Asharelah; the sons of Asaph were under the
direction of Asaph who prophesied at the king’s direction.

1 Ch 25:3 Of Jeduthun there were the sons of Jeduthun: Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Hashabiah and Mattithiah,
six, under the direction of their father Jeduthun who, with the harp, prophesied when thanks and praise were to
be given to Yahweh.

ICh 25:4 Of Heman there were the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, Jerimoth, Hananiah,
Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, Romamti-Ezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, Mahazioth.

ICh 25:5 All these were sons of Heman, the king’s seer; at God’s word they blew the horn. God gave Heman
fourteen sons and three daughters.

1 Ch 25:6 Under the king’s direction all these had the duty of singing to the accompaniment of cymbal, lyre and
harp for the liturgy of the house of God under the direction of their fathers. Asaph, Jeduthun and Heman,

ICh 25:7 trained in the songs of Yahweh, with their brothers, numbered two hundred and eighty-eight, all
expert.

1 Ch 25:8 Junior and senior, master and pupil alike, they drew lots for their term of duty.

ICh 25:9 The first to whom the lot fell was the Asaphite, Joseph. The second was Gedaliah, who with his sons
and brothers made twelve.

ICh 25:10 The third was Zaccur, who with his sons and brothers made twelve.

ICh 25:1 1 The fourth was Izri, who with his sons and brothers made twelve.

ICh 25:26 The nineteenth was Mallothi, who with his sons and brothers made twelve.

ICh 25:27 The twentieth was Eliathah, who with his sons and brothers made twelve.

ICh 25:28 The twenty-first was Hothir, who with his sons and brothers made twelve.

ICh 25:29 The twenty-second was Giddalti, who with his sons and brothers made twelve.

ICh 25:30 The twenty-third was Mahazioth, who with his sons and brothers made twelve.

ICh 25:31 The twenty-fourth was Romamti-Ezer, who with his sons and brothers made twelve.

ICh 26:1 As regards the orders of the gatekeepers: Of the Korahites there was Meshelemiah son of Kore, one
of the sons of Ebiasaph,

ICh 26:2 and Meshelemiah’s sons: Zechariah the first-born, Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the
fourth,

ICh 26:3 Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, Elioenai the seventh.



1 Ch 26:4 Obed-Edom’s sons were: Shemaiah the first-born, Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, Sacar the
fourth, Nethanel the fifth,

ICh 26:5 Ammiel the sixth, Issacharthe seventh, Peullethai the eighth; God had indeed blessed him.

1 Ch 26:6 His son Shemaiah also had sons who wielded authority in their family, because they were men of
outstanding quality.

ICh 26:7 The sons of Shemaiah were: Othni, Rephael, Obed and Elzabad, whose brothers Elihu and
Semachiah were outstanding men.

1 Ch 26:8 All these were sons of Obed-Edom, who with their sons and brothers were men of standing, well fitted
for their task. Obed-Edom had sixty-two.

ICh 26:9 Meshelemiah had eighteen outstanding sons and brothers.

ICh 26:10 Hosah, one of the sons of Merari, had sons: Shimri was the first, for although he was not the first-
born his father had made him the chief.

ICh 26:1 1 Hilkiah was the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth: Hosah had thirteen sons and
brothers in all.

ICh 26:12 These orders of gatekeepers, allocated according to their headmen, had duties, just like their
brothers, of serving in the house of Yahweh.

ICh 26:13 Similarly, they drew lots for each gate, whether their families were large or small.

ICh 26:14 For the eastern one, the lot fell to Shelemiah; and when they drew lots for Zechariah his son, a
shrewd counsellor, his lot came out for the north.

ICh 26:15 To Obed-Edom went the south, and to his sons the storehouses.

ICh 26:16 To Shuppim and Hosah went the west with the Gate of the Felled Tree-trunk on the upper road. The
corresponding guards were as follows:

ICh 26:17 for the east gate, six per day; for the north gate, four per day; for the south gate, four per day; for the
storehouses, two each;

ICh 26:18 for the Parbar at the west gate, four by the road and two for the Parbar.

ICh 26:19 These were the orders of the gatekeepers of the sons of Korah and the sons of Merari.

1 Ch 26:20 The Levites, their brothers, who were responsible for the treasures of the house of God and for the
treasures of consecrated gifts,

1 Ch 26:21 were the sons of Ladan and belonged to the Gershonites -- the heads of the families of Ladan were
descended from Ladan the Gershonite -- that is to say, the Jehielites.

ICh 26:22 The sons of the Jehielites, Zetham and Joel his brother, were responsible for the treasures of the
house of Yahweh.

ICh 26:23 Over the Amramites, Izharites, Hebronites, and Uzzielites

ICh 26:24 was Shebuel son of Gershom, son of Moses, who was governor of the treasures;

ICh 26:25 and his brothers of the line of Eliezer were Rehabiah his son, Jeshaiah his son, Joram his son, Zichri
his son and Shelomoth his son.

ICh 26:26 This Shelomoth and his kinsmen were responsible for all the consecrated treasures dedicated by
King David, by the heads of families, by the commanders of the thousands and hundreds and by the
commanders of the army,

1 Ch 26:27 who had dedicated a part of the spoils of war to the service of the house of Yahweh,

1 Ch 26:28 and also for all that Samuel the seer, Saul son of Kish, Abner son of Ner and Joab son of Zeruiah
had dedicated. In fact, whatever was dedicated was the responsibility of Shelomoth and his kinsmen.

ICh 26:29 Of the Izharites, Chananiah and his sons were assigned to secular duties for Israel as officials and
judges.

ICh 26:30 Of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his kinsmen, one thousand seven hundred outstanding men were
in charge of Israel west of Jordan in everything pertaining to Yahweh and to the service of the king.

ICh 26:31 Of the Hebronites, Jerijah was the head. In the fortieth year of David’s reign research was done on
the lineage and relationships of the Hebronites, and men of outstanding quality from among them were found at
Jazer in Gilead.

ICh 26:32 There were twenty-seven hundred outstanding men, heads of families, whom King David put in
charge of the Reubenites, the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh in all matters pertaining to God and the
king.

ICh 27:1 The Israelites listed according to heads of families, commanders of thousands and hundreds, with
their officials in the king’s service who dealt with all matters affecting the companies on monthly duty, month by
month throughout the year, each company consisting of twenty-four thousand men:

ICh 27:2 The commander of the first company detailed for the first month was Jashobeam son of Zabdiel,
whose company consisted of twenty-four thousand men.

ICh 27:3 He belonged to the family of Perez and was the senior military officer of all those detailed for the first
month.



ICh 27:4 The commander of the company for the second month was Dodai the Ahohite, whose company
consisted of twenty-four thousand men.

ICh 27:5 The officer commanding the third body of men for the third month was Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the
chief priest, whose company consisted of twenty-four thousand men.

ICh 27:6 This was the Benaiah who was an important member of the Thirty and his company. His son was
Ammizabad.

ICh 27:7 The fourth for the fourth month was Asahel brother of Joab, and his son Zebadiah after him, whose
company consisted of twenty-four thousand men.

ICh 27:8 The fifth officer commanding for the fifth month was Shamhuth the Zerahite, whose company
consisted of twenty-four thousand men.

ICh 27:9 The sixth for the sixth month was Ira son of Ikkesh of Tekoa, whose company consisted of twenty-four
thousand men.

ICh 27:10 The seventh for the seventh month was Helez the Pelonite, one of the Ephraimites, whose company
consisted of twenty-four thousand men.

ICh 27:1 1 The eighth for the eighth month was Sibbecai of Hushah, a Zerahite, whose company consisted of
twenty-four thousand men.

ICh 27:12 The ninth for the ninth month was Abiezerof Anathoth, a Benjaminite, whose company consisted of
twenty-four thousand men.

ICh 27:13 The tenth for the tenth month was Maharai of Netophah, a Zerahite, whose company consisted of
twenty-four thousand men.

ICh 27:14 The eleventh for the eleventh month was Benaiah of Pirathon, an Ephraimite, whose company
consisted of twenty-four thousand men.

ICh 27:15 The twelfth for the twelfth month was Heldai of Netophah, of Othniel, whose company consisted of
twenty-four thousand men.

ICh 27:16 Responsible for the tribes of Israel were chief Eliezer son of Zichri for the Reubenites, Shephatiah
son of Maacah for the Simeonites,

ICh 27:17 Hashabiah son of Kemuel for the Levites, Zadok for the Aaronites,

ICh 27:18 Elihu, one of David’s brothers, for Judah, Omri son of Michael for Issachar,

ICh 27:19 Ishmaiah son of Obadiah forZebulun, Jerimoth son of Azriel for Naphtali,

ICh 27:20 Hoshea son of Azaziah for the Ephraimites, Joel son of Pedaiah for the half-tribe of Manasseh,

ICh 27:21 Iddo son of Zechariah for the half-tribe of Manasseh in Gilead, Jaasiel son of Abner for Benjamin,

ICh 27:22 and Azarel son of Jeroham for Dan. These were the tribal chiefs of Israel.

ICh 27:23 Now in the census David did not include those who were twenty years old and under, since Yahweh
had promised to make Israel as numerous as the stars of heaven.

ICh 27:24 Joab son of Zeruiah began the count but never finished. This is why retribution came upon Israel,
and the number did not come up to that recorded in the annals of King David.

ICh 27:25 Overseer of the king’s supplies: Azmaveth son of Adiel. Overseer of supplies in the countryside,
towns, villages and fortresses: Jonathan son of Uzziah.

ICh 27:26 Overseer of the farmers who tilled the land: Ezri son of Chelub.

ICh 27:27 Overseer of vineyards: Shimei of Ramah. Overseer of those in the vineyards who looked after the
wine cellars: Zabdi of Shepham.

ICh 27:28 Overseer of olive and sycamore trees in the Shephelah: Baal-Hanan of Geder. Overseer of oil
supplies: Joash.

ICh 27:29 Overseer of cattle at pasture in the plains of Sharon: Shitrai of Sharon. Overseer of cattle in the
valleys: Shaphat son of Adlai.

ICh 27:30 Overseer of camels: Obil the Ishmaelite.

ICh 27:31 Overseer of donkeys: Jehdeiah of Meranoth. Overseer of flocks: Jazizthe Hagrite. All the above
supervised the property belonging to King David.

ICh 27:32 Jonathan, David’s uncle, a councillor, wise man and scribe, and Jehiel son of Hachmoni took care of
the king’s sons.

ICh 27:33 Ahitophel was the king’s counsellor and Hushai, the Archite, was Friend of the King.

ICh 27:34 Jehoiada son of Benaiah and Abiathar succeeded Ahitophel -- Joab was commander of the king's
army.

ICh 28:1 David then summoned to Jerusalem all the officials of Israel -- the tribal chiefs, the senior officials in
the royal service, the commanders of the thousands, the commanders of the hundreds and the overseers of all
the property and livestock belonging to the king and to his sons -- including the court officials, the champions and
all the men of standing.

ICh 28:2 King David then rose to his feet and said: “My brothers and my people, listen to me. I have set my
heart on building a settled home for the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, for the footstool for our God, but when I



was ready to build it,

1 Ch 28:3 God said to me, "You must not build a house for my name, for you have been a man of war and have
shed blood."

ICh 28:4 “Even so, out of my entire family, it was I whom Yahweh, God of Israel, chose to reign over Israel for
ever. Having chosen Judah as leader, and my family out of the House of Judah, it pleased him out of all my
father’s sons to make me king of all Israel.

1 Ch 28:5 Out of all my sons -- for Yahweh has given me many -- he has chosen my son Solomon to sit on
Yahweh’s sovereign throne over Israel.

ICh 28:6 Furthermore, he has told me, "Solomon your son is the man to build my house and my courts, for I
have chosen him to be my son and I shall be his father.

ICh 28:7 I shall make his sovereignty secure for ever if he sturdily carries out my commandments and
ordinances as he does now."

1 Ch 28:8 “So now in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of Yahweh, and in the hearing of our God, I charge you
to observe and adhere strictly to all the commandments of Yahweh your God, so that you may retain possession
of this fine country and leave it to your sons after you as a heritage for ever.

1 Ch 28:9 “And you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father and serve him with an undivided heart and
willing mind; for Yahweh scrutinises all hearts and understands whatever plans they may devise. If you seek
him, he will let you find him; but forsake him and he will cast you off for ever.

ICh 28:10 So, since Yahweh has chosen you to build a house for his sanctuary, go resolutely to work!”.

ICh 28:1 1 David then gave his son Solomon the plans for the portico, the plans for the buildings, its
storehouses, its upper rooms, its inner rooms and the room for the throne of mercy

ICh 28:12 as well as the plans for everything that he had in mind: for the courts of the house of Yahweh, for all
the surrounding rooms, for the treasuries of the house of God and for the sacred treasuries,

ICh 28:13 for the orders of priests and Levites, for all the duties to be carried out in the service of the house of
Yahweh, and for all the liturgical objects to be used in the house of Yahweh;

ICh 28:14 for the gold bullion, for all the golden liturgical objects of various uses; for the silver bullion, for all the
silver liturgical objects of various uses;

ICh 28:15 for the gold bullion for the golden lamp-stands and for their lamps, and for the silver bullion for the
silver lamp-stands and their lights, depending on the function of each lamp-stand;

ICh 28:16 for the gold bullion for each of the tables for the loaves of permanent offering and the silver for the
silver tables;

ICh 28:17 for the pure gold for the forks, the bowls and the jars, for the gold bullion for each of the golden
basins and for the silver bullion for each of the silver basins;

ICh 28:18 and for the refined gold bullion for the altar of incense; also for the gold for the model of the chariot
and of the great winged creatures which cover the ark of the covenant of Yahweh with wings outspread-
ICh 28:19 all this was in the document conveying Yahweh’s instructions, by which he revealed the pattern of
what was to be done.

ICh 28:20 David then said to his son Solomon, “Be resolute and courageous in your work, do not be afraid or
disheartened, because Yahweh God, my God, is with you. He will not fail you or forsake you before you have
finished all the work to be done for the house of Yahweh.

ICh 28:21 And besides, there are the orders of priests and Levites for whatever is needed in connection with
the house of God, and you have at your disposal every kind of craftsman for whatever has to be done, as well as
the officials and all the people entirely at your command”.

ICh 29:1 David then addressed the whole assembly, “Solomon my son, whom Yahweh has specifically chosen,
is young and immature, and the work is great; this palace is not for any human being but for Yahweh God.

1 Ch 29:2 With all the resources I can command, for the house of my God I have provided gold for what must be
made of gold, silver for what must be made of silver, bronze for what must be made of bronze, iron for what must
be made of iron, wood for what must be made of wood, as well as cornelian for inlay work, slabs of multi-
coloured mosaic, every kind of precious stone and quantities of alabaster.

ICh 29:3 Furthermore, because my affections are set on the house of my God, I have also given what gold and
silver I personally own for the house of my God, over and above everything which I have already provided for the
holy Temple-

ICh 29:4 that is to say, three thousand talents of gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver for
overlaying the walls of the buildings,

1 Ch 29:5 the gold being for what must be made of gold, and the silver for what must be made of silver: and for
whatever the craftsmen must make. Who, then, is willing to devote himself to Yahweh’s service today?'

1 Ch 29:6 At this, the heads of families, the tribal chiefs of Israel, the commanders of the thousands and the
hundreds and those who managed the king’s affairs,

ICh 29:7 volunteered a gift of five thousand talents and ten thousand darics of gold, ten thousand talents of



silver, eighteen thousand talents of bronze and a hundred thousand talents of iron,

ICh 29:8 while those who owned precious stones presented them to the treasury of the house of Yahweh in the
custody of Jehiel the Gershonite.

1 Ch 29:9 The people rejoiced at what these had given so readily, since they had presented their freewill
offerings wholeheartedly to Yahweh. King David too was filled with joy.

ICh 29:10 Hence, in the presence of the whole assembly David blessed Yahweh. David said: “May you be
blessed, Yahweh, God of Israel our ancestor, for ever and for ever!

ICh 29:11 Yours, Yahweh, is the greatness, the power, the splendour, length of days and glory, everything in
heaven and on earth is yours. Yours is the sovereignty, Yahweh; you are exalted, supreme over all.

ICh 29:12 Wealth and riches come from you, you are ruler of all, in your hand lie strength and power, and you
bestow greatness and might on whomsoever you please.

ICh 29:13 So now, our God, we give thanks to you and praise your majestic name,

ICh 29:14 for who am I and what is my people, for us to be able to volunteer offerings like this? - since
everything has come from you and we have given you only what you bestowed in the first place,

ICh 29:15 and we are guests before you, and passing visitors as were all our ancestors, our days on earth
fleeting as a shadow and without hope.

ICh 29:16 Yahweh our God, all this wealth, which we have provided to build a house for your holy name, has
come from you and all belongs to you.

ICh 29:17 “Knowing, my God, how you examine our motives and how you delight in integrity, with integrity of
motive I have willingly given all this and have been overjoyed to see your people, now present here, willingly
offering their gifts to you.

ICh 29:18 Yahweh, God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel our ancestors, watch over this for ever, shape the
purpose of your people’s heart and direct their hearts to you,

ICh 29:19 and give an undivided heart to Solomon my son to keep your commandments, your decrees and
your statutes, to put them all into effect and to build the palace for which I have made provision”.

ICh 29:20 David then addressed the whole assembly: “Now bless Yahweh your God!”. And the whole assembly
blessed Yahweh, God of their ancestors, bowing down in homage to Yahweh, and to the king.

ICh 29:21 On the day following this, they slaughtered sacrifices and brought burnt offerings to Yahweh on
behalf of Israel -- a thousand bulls, a thousand rams, a thousand lambs with their libations, as well as many
other sacrifices-

ICh 29:22 and they ate and drank that day in Yahweh’s presence with great joy. They then made Solomon son
of David king a second time, anointing him as leader for Yahweh, and Zadok as priest.

ICh 29:23 Solomon took his seat on Yahweh’s throne, to reign in succession to David his father. He prospered,
and all Israel obeyed him.

ICh 29:24 All the chiefs, all the leading citizens and all King David’s other sons pledged allegiance to King
Solomon.

ICh 29:25 Yahweh made Solomon exceedingly powerful, as all Israel could see, and gave him a reign of such
splendour as no previous king of Israel ever had.

ICh 29:26 David son of Jesse was king of all Israel.

1 Ch 29:27 He was king of Israel for a period of forty years; he reigned at Hebron for seven years, and in
Jerusalem for thirty-three.

1 Ch 29:28 He died at a good old age, full of days, riches and honour. Then his son Solomon succeeded him.
ICh 29:29 The history of King David, from first to last, is all written down in the records of Samuel the seer, the
records of Nathan the prophet and the records of Gad the seer,

ICh 29:30 with his entire reign, his mighty deeds and the times which he, Israel and all the kings of other
countries, had experienced.
