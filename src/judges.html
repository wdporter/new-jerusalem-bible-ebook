<h2 id="i">I: First Introduction (1:1–2:5)</h2>

<h3>Summary of the Settlement of Canaan (1:1–2:5)</h3>

<h4>The settlement of Judah, Simeon, Caleb and the Kenites (1:1–21)</h4>

<p>Now after Joshua’s death, the Israelites consulted Yahweh, asking, “Which of us is to march on the Canaanites first, to make war on them?”. </p>

<p>And Yahweh replied, “Judah is to march on them first; I am delivering the country into his hands”. </p>

<p>Judah then said to his brother Simeon, “March with me into the territory allotted to me; we shall make war on the Canaanites, and then I in my turn shall march into your territory with you”. And Simeon marched with him. So Judah marched on them, and Yahweh delivered the Canaanites and Perizzites into their hands, and they defeated them at Bezek-ten thousand of them! At Bezek they came upon Adoni-Bezek; they joined battle with him and defeated the Canaanites and Perizzites. Adoni-Bezek took to flight, but they chased and captured him and cut off his thumbs and big toes. </p>

<p>Adoni-Bezek said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off used to pick up the crumbs under my table. As I did, God does to me”. He was taken to Jerusalem, and there he died. (The sons of Judah attacked Jerusalem and took it: they put its people to the sword and set fire to the city.) </p>

<p>After this the sons of Judah went down to make war on the Canaanites who were living in the highlands, the Negeb and the lowlands. Judah next marched on the Canaanites living in Hebron — the name of Hebron in olden days was Kiriath-Arba — and beat Sheshai, Ahiman and Talmai. From there, he marched on the inhabitants of Debir — the name of Debir in olden days was Kiriath-Sepher. Caleb said, “To the man who conquers and captures Kiriath-Sepher, I shall give my daughter Achsah as wife”. The man who captured it was Othniel son of Kenaz, younger brother of Caleb, who gave him his daughter Achsah as wife. When she arrived, he urged her to ask her father for arable land, but when she alighted from the donkey and Caleb asked her, “What is the matter?”, she said to him, “Grant me a blessing! As the land you have given me is the Negeb, give me springs of water, too!”. So Caleb gave her what she wanted: the upper springs and the lower springs. </p>

<p>The sons of Hobab the Kenite, father-in-law of Moses, marched up with the sons of Judah from the City of Palm Trees into the desert of Judah lying in the Negeb of Arad, where they went and settled among the people. </p>

<p>Judah then set out with his brother Simeon. They beat the Canaanites who lived in Zephath and delivered it over to the curse of destruction; hence the town was given the name of Hormah. Judah then captured Gaza and its territory, Ashkelon and its territory, Ekron and its territory. And Yahweh was with Judah, who made himself master of the highlands; he could not, however, dispossess the inhabitants of the plain, since they had iron chariots. </p>

<p>As Moses had directed, Hebron was given to Caleb, and he drove the three sons of Anak out of it. As regards the Jebusites living in Jerusalem, the sons of Benjamin did not dispossess them, and the Jebusites have been living in Jerusalem with the sons of Benjamin ever since. </p>

<h4>The capture of Bethel (1:22–26)</h4>

<p>Similarly, the House of Joseph marched on Bethel, and Yahweh was with them. The House of Joseph made a reconnaissance of Bethel. (In olden days, the name of the town was Luz.) The scouts saw a man coming out of the town and said to him, “Show us how to get into the town and we shall show you faithful love”. And when he had shown them a way into the town, they put the town to the sword but let the man and his whole clan go. The man went off to the country of the Hittites and built a town which he called Luz; and that has been its name ever since. </p>

<h4>The Northern tribes (1:27–36)</h4>

<p>Manasseh did not dispossess Beth-Shean and its dependencies, nor Taanach and its dependencies, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its dependencies, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its dependencies, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its dependencies; in those parts the Canaanites held their ground. But when the Israelites became stronger, they subjected the Canaanites to forced labour, although they did not dispossess them. Nor did Ephraim dispossess the Canaanites living in Gezer; thus, the Canaanites went on living in Gezer with him. Zebulun did not dispossess the inhabitants of Kitron or of Nahalol. The Canaanites lived on with Zebulun but were subjected to forced labour. Asher did not dispossess the inhabitants of Acco, nor those of Sidon, of Mahalab, of Achzib, of Helbah, of Aphek or of Rehob. So the Asherites lived among the Canaanite inhabitants of the country, not having dispossessed them. Naphtali did not dispossess the inhabitants of Beth-Shemesh or of Beth-Anath; they settled among the Canaanite inhabitants of the country, but the inhabitants of Beth-Shemesh and of Beth-Anath were subjected to forced labour for them. The Amorites drove the Danites back into the highlands and would not let them come down into the plain. The Amorites held their ground at Har — Heres and Shaalbim, but when the hand of the House of Joseph grew heavier, they were subjected to forced labour. </p> 

<p>(The territory of the Edomites begins at the Ascent of Scorpions, runs to the Rock and continues on upwards.) </p>

<h4>The Angel of Yahweh tells Israel of disasters to come (2:1–5)</h4>

<p>The Angel of Yahweh went up from Gilgal to Bethel and said, “I have brought you out of Egypt and led you into this country, which I promised on oath to your ancestors. I said, ‘I shall never break my covenant with you. You for your part must make no covenant with the inhabitants of this country; you will destroy their altars’. But you have not listened to my voice. What is the reason for this? Very well, I now say this, ‘I am not going to drive these nations out before you. They will become your oppressors, and their gods will be a snare for you’. When the angel of Yahweh had spoken these words to all the Israelites, the people began to wail at the top of their voices.And they called the place Bochim, and offered sacrifices to Yahweh there. </p>

<h2 id="ii">II: Second Introduction (2:6–3:6)</h2>

<h3>General Reflections on the Period of the Judges (2:6–10)</h3>

<p>Joshua having dismissed the people, the Israelites then went away, each one to his own heritage, to occupy the country. The people served Yahweh throughout the lifetime of Joshua and throughout the lifetime of those elders who outlived Joshua and had known all the great deeds which Yahweh had done for the sake of Israel. Joshua son of Nun, servant of Yahweh, was a hundred and ten years old when he died. He was buried on the estate which he had received as his heritage at Timnath-Heres in the highlands of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash. And when that whole generation had been gathered to its ancestors, another generation followed it which knew neither Yahweh nor the deeds which he had done for the sake of Israel. </p>

<h4>Religious interpretation of the period of the Judges (2:11–19)</h4>

<p>The Israelites then did what is evil in Yahweh’s eyes and served the Baals. They deserted Yahweh, God of their ancestors, who had brought them out of Egypt, and they followed other gods, from those of the surrounding peoples. They bowed down to these; they provoked Yahweh; they deserted Yahweh to serve Baal and Astartes. Then Yahweh’s anger grew hot against Israel. He handed them over to pillagers who plundered them; he delivered them to the enemies surrounding them, and they were no longer able to resist their enemies. Whenever they mounted an expedition, Yahweh’s hand was there to foil them, as Yahweh had told them and as Yahweh had sworn to them, so that they were in dire distress. Yahweh then appointed them judges, who rescued them from the hands of their plunderers. But even to their judges they refused to listen. They prostituted themselves to other gods and bowed down before these. Very quickly they left the path which their ancestors had trodden in obedience to the orders of Yahweh; they did not follow their example. When Yahweh appointed judges for them, Yahweh was with the judge and rescued them from the hands of their enemies as long as the judge lived, since Yahweh relented at their groans under their persecutors and oppressors. But once the judge was dead, they relapsed into even worse corruption than their ancestors. They followed other gods; they served them and bowed before them and would not give up the practices and stubborn ways of their ancestors at all. </p>

<h4>Why foreign nations survived in Canaan (2:20–3:6)</h4>

<p>Yahweh’s anger then blazed out against Israel, and he said, “Since this people has broken the covenant which I laid down for their ancestors, since they have not listened to my voice, in future I shall not drive before them any one of those nations which Joshua left when he died, in order, by means of them, to put Israel to the test, to see whether or not they would tread the paths of Yahweh as once their ancestors had trodden them”. Hence, Yahweh allowed these nations to remain; he did not hurry to drive them out, and did not deliver them into the hands of Joshua. </p>

<p>These are the nations which Yahweh allowed to remain, by their means to put all those Israelites to the test who had not experienced any of the Canaanite wars (this was only to instruct the Israelites’ descendants, to teach them the art of war, those at least who had not experienced it previously): the five chiefs of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hittites who lived in the range of the Lebanon, from the uplands of Baal-Hermon to the Pass of Hamath. They were used to put Israel to the test and see if they would keep the orders which Yahweh had given their ancestors through Moses. The Israelites lived among the Canaanites, Hittites and Amorites, the Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites; they married their daughters, they gave their own sons to their daughters and they served their gods. </p>
<hr />
Jdg 3:7 The Israelites did what is evil in Yahweh’s eyes. They forgot Yahweh their God and served Baals and
Asherahs.

Jdg 3:8 Then Yahweh’s anger blazed out against Israel: he handed them over to Cushan-Rishathaim king of
Edom, and the Israelites were enslaved to Cushan-Rishathaim for eight years.

Jdg 3:9 The Israelites then cried to Yahweh and Yahweh raised for the Israelites a deliverer who rescued them,
Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother.

Jdg 3:10 The spirit of Yahweh was on him; he became judge in Israel and set out for war. Yahweh delivered
Cushan-Rishathaim king of Edom into his hands, and he triumphed over Cushan- Rishathaim.

Jdg 3:1 1 The country then had peace for forty years. Othniel son of Kenaz then died.

Jdg 3:12 Again the Israelites began doing what is evil in Yahweh’s eyes, and Yahweh strengthened Eglon king
of Moab against Israel, since they were doing what is evil in Yahweh’s eyes.

Jdg 3:13 Eglon in conjunction with the sons of Ammon and Amalek marched on Israel, beat them and captured
the City of Palm Trees.

Jdg 3:14 The Israelites were enslaved to Eglon king of Moab for eighteen years.

Jdg 3:15 The Israelites then cried to Yahweh, and Yahweh raised a deliverer for them, Ehud son of Gera, a
Benjaminite; he was left-handed. The Israelites appointed him to take their tribute to Eglon king of Moab.

Jdg 3:16 Ehud made himself a dagger — it was double-edged and a foot long — and strapped it under his
clothes on his right thigh.

Jdg 3:17 He presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. This Eglon was a very fat man.

Jdg 3:18 Having presented the tribute, Ehud sent away the men who had been carrying it;

Jdg 3:19 but he himself, on reaching the Idols which are near Gilgal, went back and said, “I have a secret
message for you, O king”. The king commanded silence, and all his attendants withdrew.

Jdg 3:20 Ehud went up to him; he was sitting in his private room upstairs, where it was cool. Ehud said to him, “I
have a message from God for you, O king”. The latter immediately rose from his seat.

Jdg 3:21 Then Ehud, reaching with his left hand, drew the dagger he was carrying on his right thigh and thrust it
into the king’s belly.

Jdg 3:22 The hilt too went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, since Ehud did not pull the
dagger out of his belly again.

Jdg 3:23 Ehud went out through the privies, having shut and bolted the doors of the upstairs room behind him.
Jdg 3:24 When he had gone, the servants came back and looked; the doors of the upstairs room were bolted.
They thought, “He is probably covering his feet in the inner part of the cool room”.

Jdg 3:25 They waited until they became embarrassed, but still he did not open the doors of the upstairs room.
Eventually, they took the key and opened the door; and there lay their master, dead, on the ground.

Jdg 3:26 Meanwhile, Ehud had got away, passed the Idols and made good his escape to safety in Seirah.

Jdg 3:27 Once there, he sounded the horn in the highlands of Ephraim, and the Israelites came down from the
hills with him at their head.

Jdg 3:28 And he said to them, “Follow me, because Yahweh has delivered your enemy Moab into your hands”.
So they followed him, seized the fords of the Jordan against Moab and allowed no one to cross.

Jdg 3:29 On that occasion they beat the Moabites, some ten thousand men, all tough and seasoned fighters,
and not one escaped.

Jdg 3:30 That day Moab was humbled under the hand of Israel, and the country had peace for eighty years.



Jdg 3:31 After him came Shamgar son of Anath. He routed six hundred of the Philistines with an ox-goad; he
too was a deliverer of Israel.

Jdg 4:1 Once Ehud was dead, the Israelites again began doing what is evil in Yahweh’s eyes,

Jdg 4:2 and Yahweh handed them over to Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned at Hazor. The commander of his
army was Sisera, who lived in Haroshet-ha-Goiim.

Jdg 4:3 The Israelites then cried to Yahweh; for Jabin had nine hundred iron chariots and had cruelly oppressed
the Israelites for twenty years.

Jdg 4:4 Deborah, a prophetess, wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel at the time.

Jdg 4:5 She used to sit under Deborah’s Palm between Ramah and Bethel in the highlands of Ephraim, and the
Israelites would come to her for justice.

Jdg 4:6 She sent for Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali, and said to him, “Has not Yahweh, God of
Israel, commanded, ‘Go! March to Mount Tabor and with you take ten thousand of the sons of Naphtali and the
sons of Zebulun.

Jdg 4:7 I shall entice Sisera, the commander of Jabin’s army, to encounter you at the Torrent of Kishon with his
chariots and troops; and I shall put him into your power?’ “

Jdg 4:8 Barak replied, “If you come with me, I shall go; if you will not come, I shall not go, for I do not know how
to choose the day when the angel of Yahweh will grant me success”.

Jdg 4:9 “I shall go with you then”, she said, “but, the way you are going about it, the glory will not be yours; for
Yahweh will deliver Sisera into the hands of a woman”. Deborah then stood up and went with Barak to Kedesh.
Jdg 4:10 Barak summoned Zebulun and Naphtali. Ten thousand men marched behind him, and Deborah went
with him.

Jdg 4:1 1 Heber the Kenite had parted company with the tribe of Kain and with the sons of Hobab, father-in-law
of Moses; he had pitched his tent near the Oak of Zaanannim, not far from Kedesh.

Jdg 4:12 Sisera was informed that Barak son of Abinoam had encamped on Mount Tabor.

Jdg 4:13 Sisera summoned all his chariots — nine hundred iron chariots — and all the troops he had, from
Harosheth-ha-Goiim to the Torrent of Kishon.

Jdg 4:14 Deborah said to Barak, “Up! For today is the day when Yahweh has put Sisera into your power. Is not
Yahweh marching at your head?”. And Barak charged down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men behind
him.

Jdg 4:15 At Barak’s advance, Yahweh struck terror into Sisera, all his chariots and his entire army. Sisera leapt
down from his chariot and fled on foot.

Jdg 4:16 Barak pursued the chariots and the army as far as Harosheth-ha-Goiim. Sisera’s whole army fell by
the edge of the sword; not one man was spared.

Jdg 4:17 Sisera meanwhile fled on foot towards the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite. For there was
peace between Jabin king of Hazor and the family of Heber the Kenite.

Jdg 4:18 Jael came out to meet Sisera and said to him, “Stay here, my lord, with me; do not be afraid!”. He
stayed with her in her tent, and she covered him with a rug.

Jdg 4:19 He said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty”. She opened the skin of milk,
gave him some to drink and covered him up again.

Jdg 4:20 Then he said to her, “Stand at the tent door, and if anyone comes and questions you — if he asks, ‘Is
there a man here?’. say, ‘No’”.

Jdg 4:21 But Jael the wife of Heber took a tent-peg and picked up a mallet; she crept up softly to him and drove
the peg into his temple right through to the ground. He was lying fast asleep, worn out; and so he died.

Jdg 4:22 And now Barak came up in pursuit of Sisera. Jael went out to meet him and said, “Come in, and I will
show you the man you are looking for”. He went into her tent; and there was Sisera dead, with the tent-peg
through his temple.

Jdg 4:23 Thus God that day humbled Jabin king of Canaan before the Israelites.

Jdg 4:24 And the Israelites bore down more and more heavily on that king of Canaan, Jabin, until he was utterly
destroyed.

Jdg 5:1 They sang a song that day, Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam, and the words were:

Jdg 5:2 That the warriors in Israel unbound their hair, that the people came forward with a will, bless Yahweh!
Jdg 5:3 Listen, you kings! Give ear, you princes! From me, from me comes a song for Yahweh. I shall glorify
Yahweh, God of Israel.

Jdg 5:4 Yahweh, when you set out from Seir, when you marched from the field of Edom, the earth shook, the
heavens pelted, the clouds pelted down water.

Jdg 5:5 The mountains melted before Yahweh of Sinai, before Yahweh, God of Israel.

Jdg 5:6 In the days of Shamgar son of Anath, in the days of Jael, there were no more caravans; those who went
forth on their travels took their way along by-paths.

Jdg 5:7 The villages in Israel were no more, they were no more until you arose, O Deborah, until you arose,



mother of Israel!

Jdg 5:8 They were choosing new gods when war was at the gates. Was there one shield, one spear to be found
among the forty thousand men in Israel?

Jdg 5:9 My heart is with the leaders of Israel, with the people who came forward with a will! Bless Yahweh!

Jdg 5:10 You who ride white donkeys and sit on saddle-blankets as you ride, and you who go on foot,

Jdg 5:1 1 sing — to the sound of the shepherds at the watering places! There they extol Yahweh’s blessings, his
saving acts for his villages in Israel! (Then Yahweh’s people marched down to the gates.)

Jdg 5:12 Awake, awake, Deborah! Awake, awake, declaim a song! Take heart, to your feet, Barak, capture your
captors, son of Abinoam!

Jdg 5:13 Then Israel marched down to the gates; like champions, Yahweh’s people marched down to fight for
him!

Jdg 5:14 The princes of Ephraim are in the valley. Behind you, Benjamin is in your ranks. Captains have come
down from Machir, those who wield the commander’s staff, from Zebulun.

Jdg 5:15 The princes of Issachar are with Deborah; Naphtali, with Barak, in the valley follows in hot pursuit. In
the clans of Reuben there was much searching of heart.

Jdg 5:16 Why did you stay among the sheepfolds, listening for the whistle, with the flocks? (In the clans of
Reuben, there was much searching of heart.)

Jdg 5:17 Gilead stayed on the other side of the Jordan, and why should Dan have stayed aboard ship? Asher
remained beside the sea, peacefully living within his ports.

Jdg 5:18 Zebulun is a people who have braved death, Naphtali too, on the high ground of the country.

Jdg 5:19 The kings came and they fought, how they fought, those kings of Canaan, at Taanach, near the
Waters of Megiddo, but no booty of silver did they take!

Jdg 5:20 The stars fought from heaven, from their orbits they fought against Sisera.

Jdg 5:21 The torrent of Kishon swept them away, the torrent of old, the torrent of Kishon. -March on, be strong
my soul!

Jdg 5:22 The horses’ hooves then hammer the ground: galloping, galloping go his steeds.

Jdg 5:23 “Curse Meroz”, said the Angel of Yahweh, “curse, curse the people living there for not having come to
Yahweh’s help, to Yahweh’s help as warriors!”.

Jdg 5:24 Most blessed of women be Jael (the wife of Heber the Kenite); of tent-dwelling women, may she be
most blessed!

Jdg 5:25 He asked for water; she gave him milk; she offered him curds in a lordly dish.

Jdg 5:26 She reached her hand out to seize the peg, her right hand to seize the workman’s mallet. She
hammered Sisera, she crushed his head, she pierced his temple and shattered it.

Jdg 5:27 Between her feet, he crumpled, he fell, he lay; at her feet, he crumpled, he fell. Where he crumpled,
there he fell, destroyed.

Jdg 5:28 At the window, she leans and watches, Sisera’s mother, through the lattice, “Why is his chariot so long
coming? Why so delayed the hoof-beats from his chariot?”.

Jdg 5:29 The wisest of her ladies answers, and she to herself repeats,

Jdg 5:30 “Are they not collecting and sharing out the spoil: a girl, two girls for each warrior; a booty of coloured
and embroidered stuff for Sisera, one scarf, two embroidered scarves for me!”.

Jdg 5:31 So perish all your enemies, Yahweh! And let those who love you be like the sun when he emerges in
all his strength! And the country had peace for forty years.

Jdg 6:1 The Israelites did what is evil in Yahweh’s eyes, and for seven years Yahweh handed them over to
Midian;

Jdg 6:2 and Midian bore down heavily on Israel. To escape from the Midianites the Israelites used the mountain
clefts and the caves and shelters.

Jdg 6:3 Whenever Israel sowed seed the Midianites would march up with Amalek and the sons of the East.

They would march on Israel.

Jdg 6:4 They would pitch camp on their territory and destroy the produce of the country as far as Gaza. They
left Israel nothing to live on, not a sheep or an ox or a donkey,

Jdg 6:5 for they came up as thick as locusts with their cattle and their tents; they and their camels were
innumerable, they invaded the country to pillage it.

Jdg 6:6 Thus, Midian brought Israel to great distress, and the Israelites cried to Yahweh.

Jdg 6:7 When the Israelites cried to Yahweh because of Midian,

Jdg 6:8 Yahweh sent a prophet to the Israelites. He said to them, “This is what Yahweh, God of Israel, says, ‘It
was I who brought you out of Egypt, and led you out of the place of slave-labour.

Jdg 6:9 I rescued you from the power of the Egyptians and from the power of all who oppressed you. I drove
them out before you and gave their country to you.

Jdg 6:10 And I said to you: I am Yahweh your God. You are not to fear the gods of the Amorites in whose



country you are now living. But you have not listened to my voice’”.

Jdg 6:1 1 The Angel of Yahweh came and sat under the terebinth at Ophrah which belonged to Joash of
Abiezer. Gideon his son was threshing wheat inside the wine-press, to keep it hidden from Midian,

Jdg 6:12 and the Angel of Yahweh appeared to him and said, “Yahweh is with you, valiant warrior!”.

Jdg 6:13 Gideon replied, “Excuse me, my lord, but if Yahweh is with us, why is all this happening to us? And
where are all his miracles which our ancestors used to tell us about when they said, ‘Did not Yahweh bring us
out of Egypt?’. But now Yahweh has deserted us; he has abandoned us to Midian”.

Jdg 6:14 At this, Yahweh turned to him and said, “Go in this strength of yours, and you will rescue Israel from
the power of Midian. Am I not sending you myself?”.

Jdg 6:15 Gideon replied, “Forgive me, my lord, but how can I deliver Israel? My clan is the weakest in Manasseh
and I am the least important of my father’s family”.

Jdg 6:16 Yahweh replied, “I shall be with you and you will crush Midian as though it were one man”.

Jdg 6:17 Gideon said, “If I have found favour in your sight, give me a sign that you are speaking to me.

Jdg 6:18 Please do not go away from here until I come back to you, bringing you my offering and laying it before
you”. And he replied, “I shall stay until you come back”.

Jdg 6:19 Gideon went away, he prepared a young goat and from an <i>ephah</i> of flour he made unleavened cakes.
He put the meat into a basket and the broth into a pot, then brought it all to him under the terebinth. As he
approached,

Jdg 6:20 the Angel of Yahweh said to him, “Take the meat and unleavened cakes, put them on this rock and
pour the broth over them”. Gideon did so.

Jdg 6:21 The Angel of Yahweh then stretched out the tip of the staff which he was carrying, and touched the
meat and unleavened cakes. Fire sprang from the rock and consumed the meat and unleavened cakes, and the
Angel of Yahweh vanished before his eyes.

Jdg 6:22 Gideon then knew that this was the Angel of Yahweh, and he said, “Alas, my Lord Yahweh! Now I have
seen the Angel of Yahweh face to face!”.

Jdg 6:23 Yahweh answered, “Peace be with you; have no fear; you will not die”.

Jdg 6:24 Gideon built an altar there to Yahweh and called it Yahweh-Peace. This altar stands in our own day at
Ophrah of Abiezer.

Jdg 6:25 Now that night, Yahweh said to Gideon, “Take your father’s bull, the seven-year-old bull, and pull down
the altar to Baal belonging to your father and cut down the sacred pole beside it.

Jdg 6:26 Then, on top of this strong-point, build a proper altar to Yahweh your God. Then take the bull and burn
it as a burnt offering on the wood of the sacred pole which you have cut down”.

Jdg 6:27 Gideon then took ten of his servants and did as Yahweh had ordered him. But, being too frightened of
his family and of the townspeople to do it in daylight, he did it at night.

Jdg 6:28 Next morning, when the townspeople got up, they found that the altar to Baal had been destroyed, the
sacred pole standing beside it had been cut down and the bull had been sacrificed as a burnt offering on the
newly built altar.

Jdg 6:29 “Who has done this?”. they asked one another. They searched, made enquiries and declared, “Gideon
son of Joash has done it”.

Jdg 6:30 The townspeople then said to Joash, “Bring out your son; he must die for having destroyed Baal’s altar
and cut down the sacred pole which stood beside it”.

Jdg 6:31 To the people all crowding round him, Joash replied, “Is it your job to plead for Baal? Is it your job to
champion his cause? (Anyone who pleads for Baal must be put to death before dawn.) If he is a god, let him
plead for himself, now that Gideon has destroyed his altar”.

Jdg 6:32 That day, Gideon was given the name Jerubbaal, because, they said, “Baal must plead against him,
because he has destroyed his altar!”.

Jdg 6:33 All Midian and Amalek and the sons of the East joined forces and, having crossed the Jordan, pitched
camp in the plain of Jezreel.

Jdg 6:34 And the spirit of Yahweh clothed Gideon around; he sounded the horn and Abiezer rallied behind him.

Jdg 6:35 He sent messengers throughout Manasseh, and Manasseh too rallied behind him; he sent

messengers to Asher, Zebulun and Naphtali, and they marched out to meet him.

Jdg 6:36 Gideon said to God, “If it is really you delivering Israel by means of me, as you have said,

Jdg 6:37 look, I am going to put a woollen fleece on the threshing-floor; if there is dew only on the fleece and all

the ground stays dry, then I shall know that you will deliver Israel by means of me, as you have said”.

Jdg 6:38 And so it happened. Early next morning, Gideon got up, squeezed the fleece and wrung enough dew
out of the fleece to fill a cup.

Jdg 6:39 Gideon then said to God, “Do not be angry with me if I speak just once more. Allow me to make the
fleece-test just once more: let the fleece alone be dry and there be dew all over the ground!”.

Jdg 6:40 And God did so that night. The fleece alone stayed dry, and there was dew all over the ground.



Jdg 7:1 Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) got up very early, as did all the people who were with him; he pitched camp
at En-Harod; the camp of Midian was north of his, under the Hill of Moreh in the valley.

Jdg 7:2 Yahweh then said to Gideon, There are too many people with you for me to put Midian into their power;
Israel might claim the credit for themselves at my expense: they might say, ‘My own hand has rescued me’.

Jdg 7:3 So now make this proclamation to the people, ‘Anyone trembling with fear is to go back and watch from
Mount Gilboa’”. Twenty-two thousand of the people went back, and ten thousand remained.

Jdg 7:4 Yahweh said to Gideon, There are still too many people. Take them down to the waterside and I shall
sort them out for you there. If I say of someöne, ‘He is to go with you’, that man is to go with you. And if I say of
anyone, ‘He is not to go with you’, that man is not to go”.

Jdg 7:5 So Gideon took the people down to the waterside, and Yahweh said to him, “All those who lap the water
with their tongues, as a dog laps, put these on one side. And all those who kneel down to drink, put these on the
other side”.

Jdg 7:6 The number of those who lapped with their hands to their mouth was three hundred; all the rest of the
people had knelt to drink.

Jdg 7:7 Yahweh then said to Gideon, “With the three hundred who lapped the water, I shall rescue you and put
Midian into your power. Let the people as a whole disperse to their homes”.

Jdg 7:8 So they took the people’s provisions and their horns, and then Gideon sent all the Israelites back to their
tents, keeping only the three hundred. The camp of Midian was below his in the valley.

Jdg 7:9 Now it happened, that same night, that Yahweh said to him, “Get up and go down to the camp. I am
putting it into your power.

Jdg 7:10 If, however, you are nervous about going down, go down to the camp with your servant Purah;

Jdg 7:1 1 listen to what they are saying, and that will encourage you to go down to the camp”. So, with his
servant Purah, he went down to the edge of the outposts of the camp.

Jdg 7:12 Midian, Amalek and all the sons of the East were deployed in the valley as thick as locusts; their
camels were as innumerable as the sand on the seashore.

Jdg 7:13 Gideon got there just as a man was telling his comrade a dream; he was saying, “This was the dream I
had: a cake made of barley bread came rolling into the camp of Midian; it came to a tent, struck against it and
turned it upside down”.

Jdg 7:14 His comrade replied, “This can only be the sword of Gideon son of Joash the Israelite. God has put
Midian and the whole camp into his power”.

Jdg 7:15 When Gideon heard the dream thus told and interpreted, he bowed in reverence; he then went back to
the camp of Israel and said, “On your feet, for Yahweh has put the camp of Midian into your power!”.

Jdg 7:16 Gideon then divided his three hundred men into three groups. To each he gave a horn and an empty
pitcher, with a torch inside each pitcher.

Jdg 7:17 He said to them, “Watch me, and do as I do. When I reach the edge of the camp, whatever I do, you
must do also.

Jdg 7:18 I shall blow my horn, and so will all those who are with me; you too will then blow your horns all round
the camp and shout, ‘For Yahweh and for Gideon!’.

Jdg 7:19 Gideon and his hundred companions reached the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle
watch, when the new sentries had just been posted; they blew their horns and smashed the pitchers in their
hands.

Jdg 7:20 The three groups blew their horns and smashed their pitchers; with their left hands they grasped the
torches, with their right hands the horns for blowing them; and they shouted, “The sword for Yahweh and for
Gideon!”.

Jdg 7:21 And they stood still, spaced out round the camp. The whole camp was thrown into confusion and the
Midianites fled, shouting.

Jdg 7:22 While the three hundred blew their horns, Yahweh made each man turn his sword against his comrade
throughout the entire camp. They all fled as far as Beth-ha-Shittah in the direction of Zarethan, as far as the
bank of Abel-Meholah opposite Tabbath.

Jdg 7:23 The men of Israel mustered from Naphtali, Asher and all Manasseh, and pursued Midian.

Jdg 7:24 Gideon sent messengers throughout the highlands of Ephraim to say, “Come down to meet Midian,
seize the water-points ahead of them as far as Beth-Barah and the Jordan”. All the men of Ephraim mustered
and seized the water-points as far as Beth-Barah and the Jordan.

Jdg 7:25 They captured the two Midianite chieftains, Oreb and Zeeb; they killed Oreb at Oreb’s Rock and Zeeb
at Zeeb’s Winepress. They pursued Midian; and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the
other side of the Jordan.

Jdg 8:1 Now the men of Ephraim said to Gideon, “What do you mean by treating us like this, not summoning us
when you went to fight Midian?”. And they reproached him bitterly.

Jdg 8:2 He replied, “What have I achieved, compared with you? Is not the gleaning of Ephraim’s grapes better



than the vintage of Abiezer?

Jdg 8:3 God delivered Oreb and Zeeb, the chieftains of Midian, into your power. What was I able to do, in
comparison with what you have done?”. At these words, their anger with him died down.

Jdg 8:4 Gideon reached the Jordan and crossed it, but he and his three hundred companions were exhausted
with the pursuit.

Jdg 8:5 So he said to the men of Succoth, “Please give my followers some loaves of bread, since they are
exhausted, and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna the kings of Midian”.

Jdg 8:6 The headmen of Succoth replied, “Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your grasp, that we
should give bread to your army?”.

Jdg 8:7 “Very well”, retorted Gideon, “when Yahweh has put Zebah and Zalmunna into my power, I shall tear
your flesh off with desert-thorn and thistles”.

Jdg 8:8 From there he went up to Penuel and asked the men of Penuel the same thing; they replied as those of
Succoth had done.

Jdg 8:9 And to those of Penuel he made a similar retort, “When I return victorious, I shall destroy this tower”.

Jdg 8:10 Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with their army, about fifteen thousand men, all that was left of
the entire army of the sons of the East. Of men bearing arms, a hundred and twenty thousand had fallen.

Jdg 8:1 1 Gideon approached them by the tent-dwellers’ route, east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and attacked the
army when it thought itself in safety.

Jdg 8:12 Zebah and Zalmunna fled. He pursued them; he took the two kings of Midian prisoner — Zebah and
Zalmunna — and the whole army he routed in panic.

Jdg 8:13 After the battle Gideon came back by the Ascent of Heres.

Jdg 8:14 He caught a young man, one of the people of Succoth, and questioned him, and the latter wrote down
the names of the headmen and elders of Succoth for him — seventy-seven men.

Jdg 8:15 Gideon son of Joash then went to the people of Succoth and said, “Here you see Zebah and
Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me and said, ‘Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your grasp,
that we should give bread to your exhausted troops?’”.

Jdg 8:16 He then seized the elders of the town and, taking desert-thorn and thistles, tore the men of Succoth to
pieces.

Jdg 8:17 He destroyed the tower of Penuel and slaughtered the townsmen.

Jdg 8:18 He then said to Zebah and Zalmunna, “The men you killed at Tabor — what were they like?”. They
replied, “They looked like you. Every one of them carried himself like the son of a king”.

Jdg 8:19 Gideon replied, “They were my brothers, the sons of my own mother; as Yahweh lives, if you had
spared their lives I would not kill you”.

Jdg 8:20 To Jether his eldest son he said, “Stand up and kill them!”. But the boy did not draw his sword; he dared
not; he was still only a lad.

Jdg 8:21 Zebah and Zalmunna then said, “Stand up yourself, and strike us down; for as a man is, so is his
strength”. Then Gideon stood up and killed Zebah and Zalmunna; and he took the crescents from round their
camels’ necks.

Jdg 8:22 The men of Israel said to Gideon, “Rule over us, you, your son and your grandson, since you have
rescued us from the power of Midian”.

Jdg 8:23 But Gideon replied, “I will not rule you, neither will my son. Yahweh shall rule you”.

Jdg 8:24 Gideon went on, however, “Let me make you one request. Each of you give me one ring out of his
booty” —for the vanquished had had gold rings, being Ishmaelites.

Jdg 8:25 “We shall give them gladly”, they replied. So he spread out his cloak, and on it each of them threw a
ring from his booty.

Jdg 8:26 The weight of the gold rings which he had asked for amounted to seventeen hundred shekels of gold,
besides the crescents and the earrings and purple garments worn by the kings of Midian, and besides the collars
round their camels’ necks.

Jdg 8:27 From this Gideon made an ephod and set it up in his town, in Ophrah. All Israel, following his example,
prostituted themselves to it, and it was a snare for Gideon and his family.

Jdg 8:28 Thus Midian was humbled before the Israelites. He did not raise his head again, and the country had
peace for forty years, as long as Gideon lived.

Jdg 8:29 So Jerubbaal son of Joash went to live at home.

Jdg 8:30 Gideon had seventy sons begotten by him, for he had many wives.

Jdg 8:31 His concubine, who lived in Shechem, also bore him a son, to whom he gave the name Abimelech.

Jdg 8:32 Gideon son of Joash died after a happy old age and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father, at
Ophrah of Abiezer.

Jdg 8:33 After Gideon’s death, the people of Israel again began to prostitute themselves to the Baals, taking
Baal-Berith for their god.



Jdg 8:34 The Israelites no longer remembered Yahweh their God, who had rescued them from all the enemies
round them.

Jdg 8:35 And to the family of Jerubbaal — Gideon — they showed no faithful gratitude for all the good which it
had done for Israel.

Jdg 9:1 Abimelech son of Jerubbaal confronted his mother’s brothers at Shechem and, to them and to the whole
clan of his maternal grandfather’s family, he said,

Jdg 9:2 “Please put this question to the leading men of Shechem: Which is better for you: to be ruled by seventy
people — all Jerubbaal’s sons — or to be ruled by one? Remember too that I am your own flesh and bone”.

Jdg 9:3 His mother’s brothers said all this on his behalf to all the leading men of Shechem, and their feelings
swayed them to follow Abimelech, since they argued, “He is our brother”.

Jdg 9:4 So they gave him seventy shekels of silver from the temple of Baal-Berith, and with this Abimelech paid
violent adventurers to follow him.

Jdg 9:5 He then went to his father’s house at Ophrah and put his brothers, Jerubbaal’s seventy sons, to death
on one and the same stone. Jotham, however, Jerubbaal’s youngest son, escaped by going into hiding.

Jdg 9:6 All the leading men of Shechem and all Beth-Millo then met and proclaimed Abimelech king at the oak
of the cultic stone at Shechem.

Jdg 9:7 News of this was brought to Jotham. He went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim and shouted at the
top of his voice: Hear me, leaders of Shechem, so that God may also hear you!

Jdg 9:8 One day the trees went out to anoint a king to rule them. They said to the olive tree, “Be our king!”.

Jdg 9:9 The olive tree replied, “Must I forgo my oil which gives honour to gods and men, to stand and sway over
the trees?’

Jdg 9:10 Then the trees said to the fig tree, “You come and be our king!”.

Jdg 9:1 1 The fig tree replied, “Must I forgo my sweetness, forgo my excellent fruit, to go and sway over the
trees?”.

Jdg 9:12 Then the trees said to the vine, “You come and be our king!”.

Jdg 9:13 The vine replied, “Must I forgo my wine which cheers gods and men, to go and sway over the trees?”.
Jdg 9:14 Then the trees all said to the thorn bush, “You come and be our king!”.

Jdg 9:15 And the thorn bush replied to the trees, “If you are anointing me in good faith to be your king, come and
shelter in my shade. But, if not, fire will come out of the thorn bush and devour the cedars of Lebanon”.

Jdg 9:16 “Now then, if you have acted in sincerity and good faith in making Abimelech king, if you have dealt
honourably with Jerubbaal and his family, and have treated him as his actions deserved,

Jdg 9:17 my father having fought for you, risked his life and rescued you from the power of Midian,

Jdg 9:18 and you today having risen up against my father’s family, murdered his sons — seventy of them on one
and the same stone — and appointed Abimelech, his slave-girl’s son, to rule the leading men of Shechem,
because he is your brother!-

Jdg 9:19 if, I say, you have acted in sincerity and good faith towards Jerubbaal and his family, then may
Abimelech be your joy and may you be his!

Jdg 9:20 If not, may fire come out of Abimelech and devour the leading men of Shechem and Beth-Millo, and
fire come out of the leading men of Shechem and Beth-Millo to devour Abimelech!”.

Jdg 9:21 Jotham then took to his heels; he fled and made his way to Beer; and there he stayed, to be out of his
brother Abimelech’s reach.

Jdg 9:22 Abimelech ruled Israel for three years.

Jdg 9:23 God then sent a spirit of discord between Abimelech and the leaders of Shechem, and the leaders of
Shechem betrayed Abimelech.

Jdg 9:24 And this was so that the crime committed against Jerubbaal’s seventy sons should be avenged, and
their blood recoil on their brother Abimelech who had murdered them, and on those leaders of Shechem who
had helped him to murder his brothers.

Jdg 9:25 The leaders of Shechem put men to ambush him on the mountain tops, and these robbed anyone
travelling their way. Abimelech was told of this.

Jdg 9:26 Gaal son of Obed, with his brothers, happened to pass through Shechem and win the confidence of
the leaders of Shechem.

Jdg 9:27 These went out into the countryside to harvest their vineyards; they trod the grapes and made merry
and went into the temple of their god. They ate and drank there and cursed Abimelech.

Jdg 9:28 Gaal son of Obed said, “Who is Abimelech, and what is Shechem, for us to be his slaves? Should not
Jerubbaal’s son and his lieutenant, Zebul, be serving the men of Hamor, father of Shechem? Why should we be
his slaves?

Jdg 9:29 Who will put this people under my command, so that I can expel Abimelech? I should say to him,
‘Reinforce your army and come out!’”.

Jdg 9:30 Zebul the governor of the town was told what Gaal son of Obed had said, and he was furious.



Jdg 9:31 He sent messengers secretly to Abimelech to say, “Look! Gaal son of Obed has come to Shechem
with his brothers, and they are stirring up the town against you.

Jdg 9:32 So, move under cover of dark, you and the men you have with you, and take up concealed positions in
the countryside;

Jdg 9:33 then in the morning at sunrise, break cover and rush on the town. When Gaal and his supporters come
out to meet you, treat them as occasion offers”.

Jdg 9:34 So Abimelech set off under cover of dark with all his own supporters and took up concealed positions
over against Shechem, in four groups.

Jdg 9:35 As Gaal son of Obed was coming out and pausing at the entrance of the town gate, Abimelech and his
supporters rose from their ambush.

Jdg 9:36 Gaal saw these men and said to Zebul, “Look, there are men coming down from the tops of the
mountains!”. Zebul answered, “You mistake the shadow of the mountains for men”.

Jdg 9:37 But Gaal insisted, “Look, there are men coming down from the Navel of the Earth and another group is
coming from the direction of the Diviners’ Oak”.

Jdg 9:38 Zebul then said, “Where are your mouthings now about ‘Who is Abimelech, for us to be his slaves?’.
Are not these the men you made light of? Sally out, then, and fight him”.

Jdg 9:39 Gaal sallied out at the head of the leaders of Shechem and engaged Abimelech.

Jdg 9:40 Abimelech drove Gaal off, who turned tail, many of his men falling dead before they could reach the
gate.

Jdg 9:41 Abimelech then stayed at Aruma, and Zebul expelled Gaal and his brothers and prevented them from
living in Shechem.

Jdg 9:42 Next day, when the people went out into the countryside, Abimelech was told of this.

Jdg 9:43 He took his men, divided them into three groups and lay in wait in the fields. When he saw the people
leaving the town, he bore down on them and slaughtered them.

Jdg 9:44 While Abimelech and his group rushed forward and took position at the entrance to the town gate, the
two other groups fell on everyone in the fields and slaughtered them.

Jdg 9:45 All that day Abimelech attacked the town. He stormed it and slaughtered the people inside, razed the
town and sowed it with salt.

Jdg 9:46 On hearing this, all the leading men inside Migdal-Shechem took refuge in the crypt of the temple of
El-Berith.

Jdg 9:47 As soon as Abimelech heard that the leading men inside Migdal-Shechem had all gathered there,

Jdg 9:48 he went up Mount Zalmon with all his men. Then taking an axe in his hands, he cut off the branch of a
tree, picked it up and put it on his shoulder, and said to the men with him, “Hurry and do what you have seen me
do”.

Jdg 9:49 Each of his men similarly cut off a branch; then, following Abimelech, they piled the branches over the
crypt and set it on fire over those who were inside; so that all the people in Migdal-Shechem died too, about a
thousand men and women.

Jdg 9:50 Abimelech then marched on Thebez, besieged it and captured it.

Jdg 9:51 In the middle of the town there was a fortified tower in which all the men and women and all the
leading men of the town took refuge. They locked the door behind them and climbed up to the roof of the tower.
Jdg 9:52 Abimelech reached the tower and attacked it. As he was approaching the door of the tower to set it on
fire,

Jdg 9:53 a woman threw down a millstone on his head and cracked his skull.

Jdg 9:54 He instantly called his young armour-bearer and said, “Draw your sword and kill me, so that it will not
be said of me that ‘A woman killed him’”. His armour-bearer ran him through, and he died.

Jdg 9:55 When the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they dispersed to their homes.

Jdg 9:56 Thus God made to recoil on Abimelech the evil he had done his father by murdering his seventy
brothers,

Jdg 9:57 and all the evil that the men of Shechem had done God made recoil on their heads too. And so the
curse of Jotham son of Jerubbaal came true for them.

Jdg 10:1 After Abimelech, Tola son of Puah, son of Dodo, rose to deliver Israel. He belonged to Issachar and
lived at Shamir in the mountain country of Ephraim.

Jdg 1 0:2 He was judge in Israel for twenty-three years; he then died and was buried at Shamir.

Jdg 10:3 After him rose Jair of Gilead, who judged Israel for twenty-two years.

Jdg 10:4 He had thirty sons who rode on thirty young donkeys and who owned thirty towns, still known today as
the Encampments of Jair, in the territory of Gilead.

Jdg 10:5 Jair then died and was buried at Kamon.

Jdg 10:6 The Israelites again began doing what is evil in Yahweh’s eyes. They served Baal and Astarte, and the
gods of Aram and Sidon, the gods of Moab and those of the Ammonites and Philistines. They deserted Yahweh



and served him no more.

Jdg 10:7 Yahweh’s anger then grew hot against Israel and he gave them over into the power of the Philistines
and the power of the Ammonites,

Jdg 10:8 who from that year onwards crushed and oppressed the Israelites for eighteen years — all those
Israelites living on the other side of the Jordan in Amorite territory, in Gilead.

Jdg 10:9 Furthermore, the Ammonites would cross the Jordan and also make war on Judah, Benjamin and the
House of Ephraim, so that Israel was in distress.

Jdg 10:10 The Israelites then cried to Yahweh and said, “We have sinned against you, because we have turned
from Yahweh our God to serve Baals”.

Jdg 10:1 1 And Yahweh said to the Israelites, “When Egyptians and Amorites, Ammonites and Philistines,

Jdg 10:12 when the Sidonians, Amalek and Midian oppressed you and you cried to me, did I not rescue you
from their power?

Jdg 10:13 But it is you who have forsaken me and served other gods; and so I shall rescue you no more.

Jdg 10:14 Go and cry to the gods whom you have chosen. Let them rescue you in your time of trouble”.

Jdg 10:15 The Israelites replied to Yahweh, “We have sinned. Treat us as you see fit, but please rescue us
today”.

Jdg 10:16 They got rid of their foreign gods and served Yahweh, who could bear Israel’s suffering no longer.

Jdg 10:17 The Ammonites gathered and pitched camp in Gilead. The Israelites rallied and pitched camp at
Mizpah.

Jdg 10:18 The people, the chieftains of Gilead, then said to one another, “Who will volunteer to attack the
Ammonites? He shall be chief of all who live in Gilead!”.

Jdg 11:1 Jephthah the Gileadite was a valiant warrior. He was a prostitute’s son. Gilead was Jephthah’s father,
Jdg 1 1 :2 but Gilead’s wife also bore him sons, and the sons of this wife, when they grew up, drove Jephthah
away, saying, “No share of the paternal heritage for you, since you are a son of another woman”.

Jdg 11:3 Jephthah fled far from his brothers and settled in the territory of Tob. Jephthah enlisted a group of
adventurers who used to go raiding with him.

Jdg 11:4 It was some time after this that the Ammonites made war on Israel.

Jdg 1 1:5 And when the Ammonites had attacked Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah from the
territory of Tob.

Jdg 1 1 :6 “Come”, they said, “and be our commander, so that we can fight the Ammonites”.

Jdg 1 1 :7 Jephthah replied to the elders of Gilead, “Didn’t you hate me and drive me out of my father’s house?
Why come to me now, when you are in trouble?”.

Jdg 1 1 :8 The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “That is why we are turning to you now. Come with us; fight the
Ammonites and be our chief, chief of all the people living in Gilead”.

Jdg 1 1 :9 Jephthah then said to the elders of Gilead, “If you bring me home to fight the Ammonites and Yahweh
defeats them for me, I am to be your chief?”.

Jdg 11:10 And the elders of Gilead then said to Jephthah, “Yahweh be witness between us, if we do not do as
you have said!”.

Jdg 11:11 So Jephthah set off with the elders of Gilead. The people put him at their head as chief and
commander; and Jephthah repeated all his conditions at Mizpah in Yahweh’s presence.

Jdg 11:12 Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites to say to him, “What do you have against us,
for you to come and make war on my country?”.

Jdg 11:13 The king of the Ammonites replied to Jephthah’s messengers, “The reason is that when Israel came
up from Egypt, they seized my country from the Arnon to the Jabbok and to the Jordan; so now restore it to me
peacefully”.

Jdg 11:14 Jephthah sent messengers back to the king of the Ammonites

Jdg 11:15 with this answer, “Jephthah says this, ‘Israel seized neither the country of Moab nor the country of the
Ammonites.

Jdg 11:16 When Israel came out of Egypt, they marched through the desert as far as the Sea of Reeds and,
having reached Kadesh,

Jdg 11:17 Israel then sent messengers to the king of Edom to say: Please let me pass through your country, but
the king of Edom would not listen. They sent similarly to the king of Moab, but he refused, and Israel remained at
Kadesh;

Jdg 11:18 later, moving on through the desert and skirting the countries of Edom and Moab until arriving to the
east of Moabite territory, the people camped on the other side of the Arnon but did not enter Moabite territory,
the Arnon being the Moabite frontier.

Jdg 11:19 Israel then sent messengers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, ruling in Heshbon. Israel’s message was:
Please let me pass through your country to my destination.

Jdg 1 1:20 But Sihon would not let Israel pass through his territory; he mustered his whole army; they encamped



at Jahaz, and he then joined battle with Israel.

Jdg 1 1 :21 Yahweh, God of Israel, delivered Sihon and his whole army into the power of Israel, who defeated
them; as the result of which, Israel took possession of the entire territory of the Amorites living in that region.

Jdg 1 1 :22 Israel took possession of all the Amorite territory from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the desert to
the Jordan.

Jdg 1 1:23 And now that Yahweh, God of Israel, has dispossessed the Amorites before his people Israel, do you
think you can dispossess us?

Jdg 1 1 :24 Will you not keep as your possession whatever Chemosh, your god, has given you? And, just the
same, we shall keep as ours whatever Yahweh our God has given us, to inherit from those who were before us!
Jdg 1 1 :25 Are you a better man than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he pick a quarrel with Israel? Did
he make war on them?

Jdg 1 1:26 When Israel settled in Heshbon and its dependencies, and in Aroer and its dependencies, or in any of
the towns on the banks of the Arnon (three hundred years ago), why did you not recover them then?

Jdg 1 1 :27 I for my part have done you no harm, but you are wronging me by making war on me. Let Yahweh
the Judge give judgement today between the Israelites and the king of the Ammonites’”.

Jdg 1 1 :28 But the king of the Ammonites took no notice of the message that Jephthah sent him.

Jdg 1 1:29 The spirit of Yahweh was on Jephthah, who crossed Gilead and Manasseh, crossed by way of
Mizpah in Gilead, and from Mizpah in Gilead crossed into Ammonite territory.

Jdg 1 1 :30 And Jephthah made a vow to Yahweh, “If you deliver the Ammonites into my grasp,

Jdg 1 1 :31 the first thing to come out of the doors of my house to meet me when I return in triumph from fighting
the Ammonites shall belong to Yahweh, and I shall sacrifice it as a burnt offering”.

Jdg 1 1:32 Jephthah crossed into Ammonite territory to attack them, and Yahweh delivered them into his grasp.
Jdg 1 1 :33 He beat them from Aroer to the border of Minnith (twenty towns) and to Abel-Keramim. It was a very
severe defeat, and the Ammonites were humbled by the Israelites.

Jdg 1 1:34 As Jephthah returned to his house at Mizpah, his daughter came out to meet him, dancing to the
sound of tambourines. She was his only child; apart from her, he had neither son nor daughter.

Jdg 1 1:35 When he saw her, he tore his clothes and exclaimed, “Oh my daughter, what misery you have
brought upon me! You have joined those who bring misery into my life! I have made a promise before Yahweh
which I cannot retract”.

Jdg 1 1:36 She replied, “Father, you have made a promise to Yahweh; treat me as the promise that you have
made requires, since Yahweh has granted you vengeance on your enemies the Ammonites”.

Jdg 1 1 :37 She then said to her father, “Grant me this! Let me be free for two months. I shall go and wander in
the mountains, and with my companions bewail my virginity”.

Jdg 1 1 :38 He replied, “Go”, and let her go away for two months. So she went away with her companions and
bewailed her virginity in the mountains.

Jdg 1 1 :39 When the two months were over she went back to her father, and he treated her as the vow that he
had uttered bound him. She had remained a virgin. And hence, the custom in Israel

Jdg 1 1 :40 for the daughters of Israel to leave home year by year and lament over the daughter of Jephthah the
Gileadite for four days every year.

Jdg 12:1 The men of Ephraim mobilised; they crossed the Jordan nearZaphon and said to Jephthah, “Why did
you go and make war on the Ammonites without asking us to go with you? We shall burn down your house over
your head!”.

Jdg 12:2 Jephthah replied, “My people and I were in serious conflict with the Ammonites. I summoned you, but
you did not come to rescue me from them.

Jdg 12:3 When I saw that no one was coming to rescue me, I took my life in my hands and marched against the
Ammonites, and Yahweh handed them over to me. So why advance on me today to make war on me?”.

Jdg 1 2:4 Jephthah then mustered all the men of Gilead and made war on Ephraim, and the men of Gilead
defeated Ephraim — since the latter used to say, “You are only fugitives from Ephraim, you Gileadites in the heart
of Ephraim and Manasseh”.

Jdg 12:5 Gilead then cut Ephraim off from the fords of the Jordan, and whenever Ephraimite fugitives said, “Let
me cross”, the men of Gilead would ask, “Are you an Ephraimite?”. If he said, “No”,

Jdg 12:6 they then said, “Very well, say Shibboleth”. If anyone said, ‘Sibboleth’, because he could not
pronounce it, then they would seize him and kill him by the fords of the Jordan. Forty-two thousand Ephraimites
fell on this occasion.

Jdg 1 2:7 Jephthah judged Israel for six years. Jephthah the Gileadite then died and was buried in his town, in
Gilead.

Jdg 1 2:8 After him, Ibzan of Bethlehem was judge in Israel.

Jdg 12:9 He had thirty sons and thirty daughters. He gave his daughters in marriage outside his clan and
brought in thirty brides from outside for his sons. He was judge in Israel for seven years.



Jdg 12:10 Ibzan then died and was buried in Bethlehem.

Jdg 12:1 1 After him, Elon of Zebulun was judge in Israel. He was judge in Israel for ten years.

Jdg 12:12 Elon of Zebulun then died and was buried at Aijalon in the territory of Zebulun.

Jdg 12:13 After him, Abdon son of Hillel of Pirathon was judge in Israel.

Jdg 12:14 He had forty sons and thirty grandsons who rode seventy young donkeys. He was judge in Israel for
eight years.

Jdg 12:15 Abdon son of Hillel of Pirathon then died and was buried at Pirathon in the territory of Ephraim, in the
Amalekite highlands.

Jdg 13:1 Again the Israelites began doing what is evil in Yahweh’s eyes, and Yahweh delivered them into the
power of the Philistines for forty years.

Jdg 1 3:2 There was a man of Zorah of the tribe of Dan, called Manoah. His wife was barren; she had borne no
children.

Jdg 13:3 The Angel of Yahweh appeared to this woman and said to her, “You are barren and have had no child,
but you are going to conceive and give birth to a son.

Jdg 13:4 From now on, take great care. Drink no wine or fermented liquor, and eat nothing unclean.

Jdg 1 3:5 For you are going to conceive and give birth to a son. No razor is to touch his head, for the boy is to be
God’s nazirite from his mother’s womb; and he will start rescuing Israel from the power of the Philistines”.

Jdg 1 3:6 The woman then went and told her husband, “A man of God has just come to me, who looked like the
Angel of God, so majestic was he. I did not ask him where he came from, and he did not tell me his name.

Jdg 13:7 But he said to me, ‘You are going to conceive and will give birth to a son. From now on, drink no wine
or fermented liquor, and eat nothing unclean. For the boy is to be God’s nazirite from his mother’s womb to his
dying day’”.

Jdg 13:8 Manoah then pleaded with Yahweh and said, “I beg you, Lord, let the man of God that you sent come
to us again and instruct us what to do about the child when he is born”.

Jdg 13:9 Yahweh heard Manoah’s prayer, and the Angel of Yahweh visited the woman again while she was
sitting in a field and when her husband Manoah was not with her.

Jdg 13:10 The woman quickly ran and told her husband, “Look”, she said, “the man who came to me the other
day has appeared to me again”.

Jdg 13:1 1 Manoah got up, followed his wife, came to the man and said to him, “Are you the man who spoke to
this woman?”. He replied, “I am”.

Jdg 13:12 Manoah then said, “When your words come true, what will be the boy’s way of life?”.

Jdg 13:13 The Angel of Yahweh replied to Manoah, “From everything that I forbade this woman, let her abstain.
Jdg 13:14 Let her swallow nothing that comes from the vine, let her drink no wine or fermented liquor, let her eat
nothing unclean and let her obey all the orders that I have given her”.

Jdg 13:15 Manoah then said to the Angel of Yahweh, “Allow us to detain you while we prepare a kid for you” —
for Manoah did not know that this was the Angel of Yahweh.

Jdg 13:16 The Angel of Yahweh said to Manoah, “Even if you did detain me, I should not eat your food; but if
you wish to prepare a burnt offering, offer it to Yahweh”.

Jdg 13:17 Manoah then said to the Angel of Yahweh, “What is your name, so that we may honour you when
your words come true?”.

Jdg 13:18 The Angel of Yahweh replied, “Why ask my name? It is a name of wonder”.

Jdg 13:19 Manoah then took the kid and the oblation and offered it on the rock as a burnt offering to Yahweh
the Wonderworker. Manoah and his wife looked on.

Jdg 13:20 Now, as the flame rose heavenwards from the altar, the Angel of Yahweh ascended in this flame
before the eyes of Manoah and his wife, and they fell face downwards on the ground.

Jdg 1 3:21 After this, the Angel of Yahweh did not appear any more to Manoah and his wife, but Manoah
understood that this had been the Angel of Yahweh.

Jdg 13:22 And Manoah said to his wife, “We are certain to die, because we have seen God”.

Jdg 1 3:23 His wife replied, “If Yahweh had meant to kill us, he would not have accepted a burnt offering and
oblation from us, he would not have let us see all this and, at the same time, have told us such things”.

Jdg 13:24 The woman gave birth to a son and called him Samson. The child grew, and Yahweh blessed him;
Jdg 13:25 and the spirit of Yahweh began to stir him in the Camp of Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.

Jdg 14:1 Samson went down to Timnah, and at Timnah he noticed a woman, a Philistine girl.

Jdg 14:2 He went home again and told his father and mother this. “At Timnah”, he said, “I noticed a woman, a
Philistine girl. So now get her for me, to be my wife”.

Jdg 14:3 His father and mother said to him, “Is there no woman among your brothers’ daughters or in our entire
nation, for you to go and take a wife among these uncircumcised Philistines?”. But Samson said to his father, “Get
that one for me; she is the one I am fond of”.

Jdg 14:4 His father and mother did not know that all this came from Yahweh, who was seeking grounds for a



quarrel with the Philistines, since at this time the Philistines dominated Israel.

Jdg 14:5 Samson went down to Timnah and, as he reached the vineyards of Timnah, he saw a young lion
coming roaring towards him.

Jdg 14:6 The spirit of Yahweh seized on him and he tore the lion to pieces with his bare hands as though it were
a kid; but he did not tell his father or mother what he had done.

Jdg 14:7 He went down and talked to the woman, and he became fond of her.

Jdg 14:8 Not long after this, Samson went back to marry her. He went out of his way to look at the carcase of
the lion, and there was a swarm of bees in the lion’s body, and honey.

Jdg 14:9 He took up some honey in his hand and ate it as he went along. On returning to his father and mother,
he gave some to them, which they ate too, but he did not tell them that he had taken it from the lion’s carcase.
Jdg 14:10 His father then went down to the woman, and Samson made a feast there, as is the custom for young
men.

Jdg 14:1 1 And when the Philistines saw him, they chose thirty companions to stay with him.

Jdg 14:12 Samson then said to them, “Let me ask you a riddle. If you can give me the answer during the seven
days of feasting, I shall give you thirty pieces of fine linen and thirty festal robes.

Jdg 14:13 But if you cannot tell me the answer, then you in your turn must give me thirty pieces of fine linen and
thirty festal robes”. “Ask your riddle”, they replied, “we are listening”.

Jdg 14:14 So he said to them: Out of the eater came what is eaten, and out of the strong came what is sweet.
But three days went by and they could not solve the riddle.

Jdg 14:15 On the fourth day they said to Samson’s wife, “Cajole your husband into explaining the riddle to us, or
we shall burn you and your father’s family to death. Did you invite us here to rob us?”.

Jdg 14:16 Samson’s wife then went to him in tears and said, “You only hate me, you do not love me. You have
asked my fellow countrymen a riddle and told not even me the answer”. He said to her, “I have not told even my
father or mother; why should I tell you?”.

Jdg 14:17 She wept on his neck for the seven days that their feasting lasted. She was so persistent that on the
seventh day he told her the answer, and she told her fellow-countrymen.

Jdg 14:18 So on the seventh day, before he went into the bedroom, the men of the town said to him: What is
sweeter than honey, and what stronger than a lion? He retorted: If you had not ploughed with my heifer, you
would never have solved my riddle.

Jdg 14:19 Then the spirit of Yahweh seized on him. He went down to Ashkelon, killed thirty men there, took
what they wore and gave the festal robes to those who had answered the riddle, then burning with rage returned
to his father’s house.

Jdg 14:20 Samson’s wife was then given to the companion who had acted as his best man.

Jdg 15:1 Not long after this, at the time of the wheat harvest, Samson visited his wife, with a kid; he said, “I wish
to go to my wife in her room”. But her father would not let him enter.

Jdg 1 5:2 “I felt sure”, he said, “that you had taken a real dislike to her, so I gave her to your companion. But
would not her younger sister suit you better? Have her instead”.

Jdg 15:3 But Samson answered them, “I can get my revenge on the Philistines now only by doing them some
damage”.

Jdg 15:4 So Samson went off and caught three hundred foxes, then took torches and, turning the foxes tail to
tail, put a torch between each pair of tails.

Jdg 15:5 He lit the torches and set the foxes free in the Philistines’ cornfields. In this way he burned both
sheaves and standing corn, and the vines and olive trees as well.

Jdg 15:6 The Philistines asked, “Who has done this?”. and received the answer, “Samson, who married the
Timnite’s daughter; his father-in-law took the wife back again and gave her to his companion instead”. The
Philistines then went and burned the woman and her father’s family to death.

Jdg 1 5:7 Samson said to them, “If that is how you behave, I swear I will not rest till I have had my revenge on
you”.

Jdg 15:8 And he fell on them systematically and caused great havoc. Then he went down to the cave in the
Rock of Etham and lived there.

Jdg 15:9 The Philistines came up and encamped in Judah and made a foray against Lehi.

Jdg 15:10 The men of Judah said to them, “Why are you attacking us?”. They replied, “We have come to seize
Samson and to treat him as he has treated us”.

Jdg 15:1 1 Three thousand men of Judah then went down to the cave of the Rock of Etham and said to him,
“Don’t you know that the Philistines have us in their power? Now what have you done to us?”. He replied, “I have
treated them only as they treated me”.

Jdg 15:12 They then said, “We have come down to take you, to hand you over to the Philistines”. He said,

“Swear to me not to kill me yourselves”.

Jdg 15:13 They replied, “No; we only want to bind you and hand you over to them; we certainly do not want to



kill you”. They then bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the Rock.

Jdg 15:14 As he was approaching Lehi, and the Philistines came running towards him with triumphant shouts,
the spirit of Yahweh was on him; the ropes on his arms became like burnt strands of flax and the cords round his
hands came untied.

Jdg 15:15 Coming across the fresh jawbone of a donkey, he reached out and snatched it up; and with it he
slaughtered a thousand men.

Jdg 15:16 And Samson said: With the jawbone of a donkey I have laid them in heaps, with the jawbone of a
donkey I have felled a thousand men.

Jdg 15:17 And with that he hurled the jawbone away; and that is why the place was called Ramath-Lehi.

Jdg 15:18 And as he was very thirsty, he called on Yahweh and said, “You yourself have worked this great
deliverance by the hand of your servant; and now must I die of thirst and fall into the hands of the
uncircumcised?”.

Jdg 15:19 Then God opened a hollow in the ground, the hollow there is at Lehi, and water gushed out of it.
Samson drank; his vigour returned and he revived. And therefore this spring was called En-ha-Kore; it is still at
Lehi today.

Jdg 1 5:20 Samson was judge in Israel in the days of the Philistines for twenty years.

Jdg 16:1 Samson then went to Gaza and, seeing a prostitute there, went in to her.

Jdg 16:2 The men of Gaza being told, “Samson has arrived”, surrounded the place and kept watch for him the
whole night at the town gate. All that night they were going to make no move, thinking, “Let us wait until
daybreak, and then kill him”.

Jdg 16:3 Till midnight, however, Samson stayed in bed, and then at midnight he got up, seized the doors of the
town gate and the two posts as well; he tore them up, bar and all, hoisted them on to his shoulders and carried
them to the top of the hill overlooking Hebron.

Jdg 1 6:4 After this, he fell in love with a woman in the Vale of Sorek; she was called Delilah.

Jdg 1 6:5 The Philistine chiefs visited her and said, “Cajole him and find out where his great strength comes
from, and how we can master him, so that we can bind him and subdue him. In return we shall each give you
eleven hundred silver shekels”.

Jdg 16:6 Delilah said to Samson, “Please tell me where your great strength comes from, and what would be
needed to bind and subdue you”.

Jdg 16:7 Samson replied, “If I were bound with seven new bowstrings which had not yet been dried, I should
lose my strength and become like any other man”.

Jdg 16:8 The Philistine chiefs brought Delilah seven new bowstrings which had not yet been dried and she took
them and bound him with them.

Jdg 16:9 She had men concealed in her room, and she shouted, “The Philistines are on you, Samson!”. Then he
snapped the bowstrings as a strand of tow snaps at a touch of the fire. So the secret of his strength remained
unknown.

Jdg 16:10 Delilah then said to Samson, “You have been laughing at me and telling me lies. But now please tell
me what would be needed to bind you”.

Jdg 16:1 1 He replied, “If I were bound tightly with new ropes which have never been used, I should lose my
strength and become like any other man”.

Jdg 16:12 Delilah then took new ropes and bound him with them, and she shouted, “The Philistines are on you,
Samson!”. She had men concealed in her room, but he snapped the ropes round his arms like thread.

Jdg 16:13 Delilah then said to Samson, “Up to now you have been laughing at me and telling me lies. Tell me
what would be needed to bind you”. He replied, “If you wove the seven locks of my hair into the warp of a cloth
and beat them together tight with the reed, I should lose my strength and become like any other man”.

Jdg 16:14 She lulled him to sleep, then wove the seven locks of his hair into the warp, beat them together tight
with the reed and shouted, “The Philistines are on you, Samson!”. He woke from his sleep and pulled out both
reed and warp. So the secret of his strength remained unknown.

Jdg 16:15 Delilah said to him, “How can you say that you love me, when your heart is not with me? Three times
now you have laughed at me and have not told me where your great strength comes from”.

Jdg 16:16 And day after day she pestered him with her talk, nagging him till he grew sick to death of it.

Jdg 16:17 At last he confided everything to her; he said to her, “A razor has never touched my head, because I
have been God’s nazirite from my mother’s womb. If my head were shorn, then my power would leave me and I
should lose my strength and become like any other man”.

Jdg 16:18 Delilah then realized that he had really confided in her; she sent for the Philistine princes with the
message, “Come just once more: he has confided everything to me”. And the Philistine chiefs came to her with
the money in their hands.

Jdg 16:19 She lulled Samson to sleep in her lap, summoned a man and had him shear off the seven locks from
his head. Thus for the first time she got control over him, and his strength left him.



Jdg 16:20 She cried, “The Philistines are on you, Samson!”. He awoke from sleep, thinking, “I shall break free as I
have done time after time and shake myself clear”. But he did not know that Yahweh had left him.

Jdg 16:21 The Philistines seized him, put out his eyes and took him down to Gaza. They fettered him with a
double chain of bronze and he spent his time turning the mill in the prison.

Jdg 16:22 But his hair began to grow again when it had been cut off.

Jdg 16:23 The Philistine chiefs assembled to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god. And amid their festivities
they said: Into our hands our god has delivered Samson our enemy.

Jdg 16:24 And as soon as the people saw their god, they acclaimed him, shouting his praises: Into our hands
our god has delivered Samson our enemy, the man who laid our country waste and killed so many of us.

Jdg 16:25 And as their hearts were full of joy, they shouted, “Summon Samson out to amuse us”. So Samson
was summoned from prison, and he performed feats in front of them; then he was put to stand between the
pillars.

Jdg 16:26 Samson then said to the boy who was leading him by the hand, “Lead me where I can touch the
pillars supporting the building, so that I can lean against them”.

Jdg 16:27 Now the building was crowded with men and women. All the Philistine chiefs were there, while about
three thousand men and women were watching Samson’s feats from the terrace.

Jdg 16:28 Samson called on Yahweh and cried out, “Lord Yahweh, I beg you, remember me; give me strength
again this once, O God, and let me be revenged on the Philistines at one blow for my two eyes”.

Jdg 16:29 And Samson took hold of the two central pillars supporting the building, and braced himself with his
right arm round one and his left round the other;

Jdg 16:30 and he shouted, “Let me die with the Philistines!”. He then heaved with all his might, and the building
fell on the chiefs and on all the people there. Those whom he brought to their death by his death outnumbered
those whom he had done to death during his life.

Jdg 16:31 His brothers and the whole of his father’s family came down and carried him away. They took him
back and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of Manoah his father. He had judged Israel for
twenty years.

<h2 id="iv">IV: Appendices (17:1–21:25)</h2>

<h3 id="iva">A: The Sanctuary of Micah and the Sanctuary of Dan (17:1–18:31)</h3>

<h4>Micah’s domestic shrine (17:1–13)</h4>

<p>In the highlands of Ephraim there was a man called Micayehu. He said to his mother, “The eleven hundred silver shekels which were taken from you and concerning which you uttered a curse, having said in my hearing … Look, I have got that silver. I was the one who took it”. </p>

<p>His mother said, “May Yahweh bless my boy!”. He gave the eleven hundred shekels back to his mother, who said, “I have indeed vowed to give this silver to Yahweh for my son, to have a statue carved and an idol cast in metal, but now I should like to give it back to you”. He, however, returned the money to his mother. </p>

<p>His mother then took two hundred silver shekels and gave them to the metalworker. With them, he carved a statue (and cast an idol in metal) which was put in Micayehu’s house. This man Micah owned a shrine; he made an ephod and some domestic images, and installed one of his sons to be his priest. In those days there was no king in Israel, and everyone did as he saw fit. </p>

<p>There was a young man of Bethlehem in Judah, of the clan of Judah, who was a Levite and resided there as a stranger. This man left the town of Bethlehem in Judah to settle wherever he could find a home. On his travels he came to the highlands of Ephraim and to Micah’s house. Micah asked him, “Where do you come from?”. </p>

<p>The other replied, “I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah. I am travelling, and am going to settle wherever I can find a home”. </p>

<p>Micah said to him, “Stay here with me; be my father and priest and I shall give you ten silver shekels a year, and clothing and food”. The Levite agreed to remain in the man’s house, and the young man became like one of his sons to
him. Micah installed the Levite; the young man became Micah’s priest and stayed in his house. And Micah said, “Now I know that Yahweh will treat me well, since I have this Levite as priest”. </p>
<hr />
Jdg 18:1 In those days there was no king in Israel. Now in those days the tribe of Dan was in search of a
territory to live in, for until then no territory had fallen to them among the tribes of Israel.

Jdg 18:2 From their clan the Danites sent five brave men from Zorah and Eshtaol to reconnoitre the country and
explore it. They said to them, “Go and explore the country”. The five men came to the highlands of Ephraim, as
far as Micah’s house, and spent the night there.

Jdg 18:3 When they were near Micah’s house, they recognised the voice of the young Levite and, going nearer,
said to him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing here? What is keeping you here?”.

Jdg 18:4 He replied, “Micah has made certain arrangements with me. He pays me a wage and I act as his
priest”.



Jdg 1 8:5 They replied, “Then consult God, so that we may know whether the journey we are on will lead to
success”.

Jdg 18:6 The priest replied, “Go in peace; Yahweh is watching over your journey”.

Jdg 18:7 The five men then left and, arriving at Laish, saw that the people living there had an untroubled
existence, according to the customs of the Sidonians, peaceful and trusting, that there was no lack or shortage
of any sort in the territory, that they were a long way away from the Sidonians and that they had no contact with
the Aramaeans.

Jdg 18:8 They then went back to their brothers at Zorah and Eshtaol and, when the latter asked them, “What
have you to report?”.

Jdg 1 8:9 they said, “Up! we must go against them, since we have looked at the country and it is excellent,
though you take no action! Waste no time in setting out and taking possession of the country.

Jdg 18:10 When you get there, you will find a trusting people. The country is wide, and God has put it at your
mercy. It is a place where there is no lack of anything on earth”.

Jdg 18:1 1 From these places, consequently, from the clan of Danites at Zorah and Eshtaol, six hundred men set
out equipped for war.

Jdg 18:12 They went up and camped at Kiriath-Jearim in Judah; and for this reason the place is still called the
Camp of Dan today. It lies to the west of Kiriath-Jearim.

Jdg 18:13 From there they entered the highlands of Ephraim and came to Micah’s house.

Jdg 18:14 The five men who had been to reconnoitre the country then spoke to their brothers. “Do you know”,
they said, “that in these houses there is an ephod, some domestic images, a carved statue and an idol cast in
metal? So now work out what you have got to do!”.

Jdg 18:15 So, turning off the road, they went to the young Levite’s dwelling, to Micah’s house, and greeted him
peacefully.

Jdg 18:16 While the six hundred men of the Danites, equipped for war, stood at the threshold of the gate,

Jdg 18:17 the five who had been to reconnoitre the country went on into the house and took the carved statue,
the ephod, the domestic images and the idol cast in metal; meanwhile the priest remained at the threshold of the
gate with the six hundred men equipped for war.

Jdg 18:18 These men, having entered Micah’s house, took the carved statue, the ephod, the domestic images
and the idol cast in metal. The priest, however, said, “What are you doing?”.

Jdg 18:19 “Be quiet”, they replied. “Put your hand over your mouth and come with us, and become our father and
priest. Are you better off as domestic priest to one man, or as priest to a tribe and clan in Israel?”.

Jdg 18:20 The priest was delighted; he took the ephod, the domestic images and the carved statue, and went
off among the people.

Jdg 18:21 Resuming their original line of march, they set off, having put the women, children, livestock and
baggage out in front.

Jdg 18:22 They had gone some distance from Micah’s house, when the people living in the houses near Micah’s
house raised the alarm and set off in pursuit of the Danites.

Jdg 1 8:23 As they shouted after the Danites, the latter, turning about, said to Micah, “What is the matter with
you, that you are shouting like this?”.

Jdg 18:24 He replied, “You have taken away my god, which I have had made, and the priest as well. You are
going away, and what have I got left? And now you ask me, ‘What is the matter?’”.

Jdg 18:25 The Danites said, “Let us hear no more from you, or quick-tempered men may set about you, and this
might cost you your life and the lives of your family!”.

Jdg 1 8:26 So the Danites went on their way; and Micah, seeing that they were the stronger, turned and went
home.

Jdg 18:27 So, having taken the god made by Micah, and the priest who had been his, the Danites marched on
Laish, on a peaceful and trusting people. They put it to the sword and they burned down the town.

Jdg 18:28 There was no one to come to the rescue, since it was a long way from Sidon and had no contact with
the Aramaeans. It lay in the valley running towards Beth-Rehob. They rebuilt the town and settled in it
Jdg 18:29 and called it Dan, from the name of Dan their ancestor who had been born to Israel; originally,
however, the town had been called Laish.

Jdg 18:30 The Danites erected the carved statue for themselves. Jonathan son of Gershom, son of Moses, and
his sons after him were priests for the tribe of Dan till the day when the inhabitants of the country were carried
away into exile.

Jdg 1 8:31 The carved statue made by Micah they installed for their own use, and there it stayed as long as the
house of God remained at Shiloh.

Jdg 19:1 In those days, when there was no king in Israel, there was a man, a Levite, whose home was deep in
the highlands of Ephraim. He took as concubine a woman from Bethlehem in Judah.

Jdg 1 9:2 In a fit of anger his concubine left him and went back to her father’s house at Bethlehem in Judah, and



she stayed there for some time — four months.

Jdg 19:3 Her husband then set out after her, to appeal to her affections and fetch her back; he had his servant
and two donkeys with him. As he was arriving at the house of the girl’s father, the father saw him and came
happily to meet him.

Jdg 19:4 His father-in-law, the girl’s father, kept him there; and he stayed with him for three days; they ate and
drank and spent the nights there.

Jdg 19:5 On the fourth day they got up early, and the Levite was preparing to leave when the girl’s father said to
his son-in-law, “Have something to eat to gather strength; you can leave later”.

Jdg 1 9:6 So they sat down and began eating and drinking, the two of them together; then the girl’s father said to
the young man, “Please agree to spend tonight here too and enjoy yourself”.

Jdg 19:7 And when the man got up to leave, the father-in-law pressed him again, and he spent another night
there.

Jdg 1 9:8 On the fifth day, the Levite got up early to leave, but the girl’s father said to him, “Please gather
strength first!”. So they stayed on until the sun began to go down, and the two men had a meal together.

Jdg 19:9 The husband was getting up to leave with his concubine and his servant when his father-in-law, the
girl’s father, said, “Look, day is fading into evening. Please spend the night here. Look, the day is nearly over.
Spend the night here and enjoy yourself. Then, early tomorrow, you can leave on your journey and go back
home”.

Jdg 19:10 But the man, refusing to stay the night, got up and went on his way, until he arrived within sight of
Jebus — that is, Jerusalem. He had with him two donkeys saddled, his concubine and his servant.

Jdg 19:1 1 By the time they were near Jebus, the light was going fast. The servant said to his master, “Come on,
please, let us turn off into this Jebusite town and spend the night there”.

Jdg 19:12 His master replied, “We shall not turn off into a town of foreigners, of people who are not Israelites;
we shall go on to Gibeah”.

Jdg 19:13 He then said to his servant, “Come on, we shall try to reach one or other of those places, either
Gibeah or Ramah, and spend the night there”.

Jdg 19:14 So they kept going and went on with their journey. As they approached Gibeah in Benjamin, the sun
was setting.

Jdg 19:15 So they turned that way to spend the night in Gibeah. Once inside, the Levite sat down in the town
square, but no one offered to take them in for the night.

Jdg 19:16 Eventually, an old man came along at nightfall from his work in the fields. He too was from the
highlands of Ephraim, although he was living in Gibeah; the people of the place, however, were Benjaminites.

Jdg 19:17 Looking up, he saw the traveller in the town square. “Where are you going?”. said the old man, “And
where have you come from?”.

Jdg 19:18 “We are on our way”, the other replied, “from Bethlehem in Judah to a place deep in the highlands of
Ephraim. That is where I come from. I have been to Bethlehem in Judah and now I am going home, but no one
has offered to take me into his house,

Jdg 19:19 although we have straw and provender for our donkeys, and I also have bread and wine for myself,
and this maidservant and the young man who is travelling with your servant; we are short of nothing”.

Jdg 19:20 “Welcome”, said the old man. “I shall see that you have all you want. You cannot spend the night in
the square”.

Jdg 1 9:21 So he took him into his house and gave the donkeys provender. The travellers washed their feet,
then ate and drank.

Jdg 19:22 While they were enjoying themselves, some townsmen, scoundrels, came crowding round the house;
they battered on the door and said to the old man, master of the house, “Send out the man who went into your
house, we should like to have intercourse with him!”.

Jdg 19:23 The master of the house went out to them and said, “No, brothers, please, do not be so wicked. Since
this man is now under my roof, do not commit such an infamy.

Jdg 1 9:24 Here is my daughter; she is a virgin; I shall bring her out to you. Ill-treat her, do what you please with
her, but do not commit such an infamy against this man”.

Jdg 19:25 But the men would not listen to him. So the Levite took hold of his concubine and brought her out to
them. They had intercourse with her and ill-treated her all night till morning; when dawn was breaking they let her
go.

Jdg 19:26 At daybreak the girl came and fell on the threshold of her husband’s host, and she stayed there until it
was light.

Jdg 1 9:27 In the morning her husband got up and, opening the door of the house, was going out to continue his
journey when he saw the woman, his concubine, lying at the door of the house with her hands on the threshold.
Jdg 19:28 “Get up”, he said, “we must leave!”. There was no answer. He then loaded her on his donkey and
began the journey home.



Jdg 19:29 Having reached his house, he took his knife, took hold of his concubine and cut her, limb by limb, into
twelve pieces; he then sent her throughout the territory of Israel.

Jdg 19:30 He gave instructions to his messengers, “This is what you are to say to all the Israelites, ‘Has
anything like this been done since the day when the Israelites came out of Egypt until today? Take this to heart,
discuss it; then give your verdict’”. And all who saw it declared, “Never has such a thing been done or been seen
since the Israelites came out of Egypt until today”.

Jdg 20:1 The Israelites then all turned out and, as one man, the entire community from Dan to Beersheba,
including Gilead, assembled in Yahweh’s presence at Mizpah.

Jdg 20:2 The leaders of the entire people, of all the tribes of Israel, were present at this assembly of God’s
people, four hundred thousand trained infantry.

Jdg 20:3 The Benjaminites heard that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpah. The Israelites then said, “Tell us
how this crime was committed”.

Jdg 20:4 The Levite, husband of the murdered woman, spoke in reply and said,

Jdg 20:5 “The men of Gibeah ganged up against me and, during the night, surrounded the house where I was
lodging. They intended to murder me. They raped my concubine to death.

Jdg 20:6 I then took my concubine, cut her up and sent her throughout the entire territory of the heritage of
Israel, since these men had committed a shameful act, an infamy, in Israel.

Jdg 20:7 Now, all you Israelites, discuss the matter and give your decision here and now”.

Jdg 20:8 The whole people stood up as one man and said, “None of us will go home, none of us will go back to
his house!

Jdg 20:9 And this is what we are now going to do to Gibeah. We shall draw lots

Jdg 20:10 and, throughout the tribes of Israel, select ten men out of a hundred, a hundred out of a thousand and
a thousand out of ten thousand to collect food for the people, so that, on their arrival, the latter may treat Gibeah
in Benjamin as this infamy perpetrated in Israel deserves”.

Jdg 20:1 1 Thus, as one man, all the men of Israel mustered against the town.

Jdg 20:12 The tribes of Israel sent messengers throughout the tribe of Benjamin to say, “What is this crime
which has been committed in your territory?

Jdg 20:13 Now, give up these men, these scoundrels, living in Gibeah, so that we can put them to death and
wipe out this evil from Israel”. The Benjaminites, however, would not listen to their brother Israelites.

Jdg 20:14 The Benjaminites left their towns and mustered at Gibeah to fight the Israelites.

Jdg 20:15 At the time, a count was made of the Benjaminites from the various towns: there were twenty-six
thousand swordsmen; and the count excluded the inhabitants of Gibeah.

Jdg 20:16 In this great army there were seven hundred first-rate left-handers, every man of whom could sling a
stone at a hair and not miss it.

Jdg 20:17 A count was also held of the men of Israel, excluding Benjamin: there were four hundred thousand
men, all experienced swordsmen.

Jdg 20:18 They moved off, up to Bethel, to consult God. The Israelites put the question, “Which of us is to go
first into battle against the Benjaminites?”. And Yahweh replied, “Judah is to go first”.

Jdg 20:19 In the morning, the Israelites moved off and pitched their camp over against Gibeah.

Jdg 20:20 The men of Israel advanced to do battle with Benjamin; they drew up their battle line in front of
Gibeah.

Jdg 20:21 But the Benjaminites sallied out from Gibeah and that day massacred twenty-two thousand Israelites.
Jdg 20:22 The army of the men of Israel then took fresh heart and again drew up their battle line in the same
place as the day before.

Jdg 20:23 The Israelites went and wept before Yahweh until evening; they then consulted Yahweh; they asked,
“Shall we join battle again with the sons of our brother Benjamin?”. Yahweh replied, “March against him!”.

Jdg 20:24 This second day, the Israelites advanced against the Benjaminites,

Jdg 20:25 and, this second day, Benjamin sallied out from Gibeah to meet them and massacred another
eighteen thousand Israelites, all experienced swordsmen.

Jdg 20:26 Then all the Israelites and the whole people went off to Bethel; they wept and sat in Yahweh’s
presence; they fasted all day till the evening and presented burnt offerings and communion sacrifices before
Yahweh.

Jdg 20:27 The Israelites then consulted Yahweh. In those days, the ark of the covenant of God was there,

Jdg 20:28 and Phinehas son of Eleazer, son of Aaron was its minister at the time. They said, “Ought I to go into
battle against the sons of my brother Benjamin again, or should I stop?”. Yahweh replied, “March! For tomorrow I
shall deliver him into your hands”.

Jdg 20:29 Israel then positioned troops in ambush all round Gibeah.

Jdg 20:30 On the third day the Israelites marched against the Benjaminites and, as before, drew up their line in
front of Gibeah.



Jdg 20:31 The Benjaminites sallied out to engage the people and let themselves be drawn away from the town.
As before, they began by killing those of the people who were on the roads, one of which runs up to Bethel, and
the other to Gibeah through open country: some thirty men of Israel.

Jdg 20:32 The Benjaminites thought, “We have beaten them, as we did the first time, 1 but the Israelites had
decided, “We shall run away and draw them away from the town along the roads”.

Jdg 20:33 All the Israelites then retreated and reformed at Baal-Tamar, while the Israelite troops in ambush
surged from their positions to the west of Gibeah.

Jdg 20:34 Ten thousand picked men, chosen from the whole of Israel, launched their attack on Gibeah. The
battle was fierce; and the others knew nothing of the disaster impending.

Jdg 20:35 Yahweh defeated Benjamin before Israel and that day the Israelites killed twenty-five thousand one
hundred men of Benjamin, all of them trained swordsmen.

Jdg 20:36 The Benjaminites saw that they were beaten. The Israelites had given ground to Benjamin, since they
were relying on the ambush which they had positioned close to Gibeah.

Jdg 20:37 The troops in ambush threw themselves against Gibeah at top speed; fanning out, they put the whole
town to the sword.

Jdg 20:38 Now it had been agreed between the Israelites and those of the ambush that the latter should raise a
smoke signal from the town,

Jdg 20:39 whereupon the Israelites in the thick of the battle would turn about. Benjamin began by killing some of
the Israelites, about thirty men, and thought, “We have certainly beaten them, as we did in the first battle”.

Jdg 20:40 But the signal, a column of smoke, began to rise from the town, and the Benjaminites looking back
saw the whole town going up in flames to the sky.

Jdg 20:41 The Israelites then turned about, and the Benjaminites were seized with terror, for they saw that
disaster had struck them.

Jdg 20:42 They broke before the Israelite onslaught and made for the desert, but the fighters pressed them
hard, while the others coming out of the town took and slaughtered them from the rear.

Jdg 20:43 They hemmed in the Benjaminites, pursued them relentlessly, crushing them opposite Gibeah on the
east.

Jdg 20:44 Of Benjamin, eighteen thousand men fell, all of them brave men.

Jdg 20:45 They then turned tail and fled into the desert, towards the Rock of Rimmon. Five thousand of them
were picked off on the roads, and the rest were relentlessly pursued as far as Gideon, two thousand of them
being killed.

Jdg 20:46 The total number of Benjaminites who fell that day was twenty-five thousand swordsmen, all of them
brave men.

Jdg 20:47 Six hundred men, however, turned tail and escaped into the desert, to the Rock of Rimmon, and
there they stayed for four months.

Jdg 20:48 The men of Israel then went back to the Benjaminites, and put them to the sword-people, livestock
and everything else that came their way in the town. And they fired all the towns involved.

Jdg 21:1 The men of Israel had sworn this oath at Mizpah, “None of us is to give his daughter in marriage to
Benjamin”.

Jdg 21 :2 The people went to Bethel and stayed there until evening, sitting before God and raising their voices,
made a great lament,

Jdg 21:3 and exclaiming, “Yahweh, God of Israel, why has this happened in Israel that a tribe should be missing
from Israel today?

Jdg 21 :4 The next day the people got up early and built an altar there; they presented burnt offerings and
communion sacrifices.

Jdg 21 :5 The Israelites then said, “Out of all the tribes of Israel, who has not come to Yahweh, to the assembly?”.
— for they had sworn a solemn oath that anyone who did not come to Yahweh at Mizpah would certainly die.

Jdg 21:6 Now the Israelites felt sorry about Benjamin their brother. “Today”, they said, “a tribe has been
amputated from Israel.

Jdg 21 :7 What shall we do to provide wives for those who are left, since we have sworn by Yahweh not to give
them any of our own daughters in marriage?”.

Jdg 21 :8 They then asked, “Out of the tribes of Israel, who is it that has not come to Yahweh at Mizpah?”. It was
discovered that no one from Jabesh in Gilead had come to the camp for the assembly;

Jdg 21:9 for, a muster having been called of the people, none of the inhabitants of Jabesh in Gilead was
present.

Jdg 21:10 The community then despatched twelve thousand of their bravest men there, with these orders: “Go
and slaughter all the inhabitants of Jabesh in Gilead, including the women and children.

Jdg 21:11 This is what you are to do. All males and all those women who have ever slept with a man, you will
put under the curse of destruction, but the lives of the virgins you will spare”. And this they did.



Jdg 21:12 Among the inhabitants of Jabesh in Gilead they found four hundred young virgins who had never
slept with a man, and brought them to the camp (to Shiloh in the territory of Canaan).

Jdg 21:13 The whole community then sent messengers to offer peace to the Benjaminites who were at the Rock
of Rimmon.

Jdg 21:14 Benjamin then came home: they were given those of the women of Jabesh in Gilead whose lives had
been spared, but there were not enough for all.

Jdg 21:15 The people felt sorry about Benjamin, Yahweh having made a breach in the tribes of Israel.

Jdg 21:16 And the elders of the community said, “What shall we do to provide wives for the survivors, since the
women of Benjamin have been wiped out?”.

Jdg 21:17 They went on, “How can we preserve a remnant for Benjamin so that a tribe may not be lost to Israel?
Jdg 21:18 We cannot give them our own daughters in marriage” —for the Israelites had taken an oath,

“Accursed be the man who gives a wife to Benjamin!”.

Jdg 21:19 “However”, they said, “there is the feast of Yahweh, held every year at Shiloh”. (The town lies north of
Bethel, east of the highway that runs from Bethel up to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.)

Jdg 21:20 So they told the Benjaminites to do as follows, “Put yourselves in ambush in the vineyards.

Jdg 21 :21 Keep watch: when the girls of Shiloh come out in groups to dance, you then come out of the
vineyards, each of you seize a wife from the girls of Shiloh and make for Benjaminite territory.

Jdg 21 :22 If their fathers or brothers come and complain to us, we shall say, ‘Let us have them, since we could
not take wives for everyone in the battle; and you could not give them to them, or you would then have been
guilty’”.

Jdg 21:23 The Benjaminites did this and, from the dancers whom they caught, took as many wives as there
were men and then, setting off, went back to their heritage, rebuilt the towns and settled down in them.

Jdg 21:24 The Israelites then dispersed, each man to rejoin his tribe and clan, each leaving that place for his
own heritage.

Jdg 21:25 In those days there was no king in Israel, and everyone did as he saw fit.
