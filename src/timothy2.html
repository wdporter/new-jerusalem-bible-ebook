<h2>The Second Letter from Paul to Timothy</h2>

<h4>Greeting and thanksgiving (1:1–5)</h4>

<p>From Paul, apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God in accordance with his promise of life in Christ Jesus, to Timothy, dear son of mine. Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Lord. </p>

<p>Night and day I thank God whom I serve with a pure conscience as my ancestors did. I remember you in my prayers constantly night and day; I remember your tears and long to see you again to complete my joy. I also remember your sincere faith, a faith which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice, and I am sure dwells also in you. </p>

<h4>The gifts that Timothy has received (1:6–18)</h4>

<p>That is why I am reminding you now to fan into a flame the gift of God that you possess through the laying on of my hands. God did not give us a spirit of timidity, but the Spirit of power and love and self-control. So you are never to be ashamed of witnessing to our Lord, or ashamed of me for being his prisoner; but share in my hardships for the sake of the gospel, relying on the power of God who has saved us and called us to be holy — not because of anything we ourselves had done but for his own purpose and by his own grace. This grace had already been granted to us, in Christ Jesus, before the beginning of time, but it has been revealed only by the appearing of our Saviour Christ Jesus. He has abolished death, and he has brought to light immortality and life through the gospel, in whose service I have been made herald, apostle and teacher. </p>

<p>That is why I am experiencing my present sufferings; but I am not ashamed, because I know in whom I have put my trust, and I have no doubt at all that he is able to safeguard until that Day what I have entrusted to him. Keep as your pattern the sound teaching you have heard from me, in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. With the help of the Holy Spirit who dwells in us, look after that precious thing given in trust. </p>

<p>As you know, Phygelus and Hermogenes and all the others in Asia have deserted me. I hope the Lord will be kind to all the family of Onesiphorus, because he has often been a comfort to me and has never been ashamed of my chains. On the contrary, as soon as he reached Rome, he searched hard for me and found me. May the Lord grant him to find the Lord’s mercy on that Day. You know better than anyone else how much he helped me at Ephesus. </p>

2Ti 2:1 As for you, my dear son, take strength from the grace which is in Christ Jesus. 

2Ti 2:2 Pass on to reliable people what you have heard from me through many witnesses so that they in turn will 
be able to teach others. 

2Ti 2:3 Bear with your share of difficulties, like a good soldier of Christ Jesus. 

2Ti 2:4 No one on active service involves himself in the affairs of civilian life, because he must win the approval 
of the man who enlisted him; 

2Ti 2:5 or again someöne who enters an athletic contest wins only by competing in the sports — a prize can be 
won only by competing according to the rules; 

2Ti 2:6 and again, it is the farmer who works hard that has the first claim on any crop that is harvested. 

2Ti 2:7 Think over what I have said, and the Lord will give you full understanding. 

2Ti 2:8 Remember the gospel that I carry, “Jesus Christ risen from the dead, sprung from the race of David”; 

2Ti 2:9 it is on account of this that I have to put up with suffering, even to being chained like a criminal. But 
God’s message cannot be chained up. 



2Ti 2:10 So I persevere for the sake of those who are chosen, so that they, too, may obtain the salvation that is 
in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. 

2Ti 2:11 Here is a saying that you can rely on: If we have died with him, then we shall live with him. 

2Ti 2:12 If we persevere, then we shall reign with him. If we disown him, then he will disown us. 

2Ti 2:13 If we are faithless, he is faithful still, for he cannot disown his own self. 

2Ti 2:14 Remind them of this; and tell them in the name of God that there must be no wrangling about words: all 
that this ever achieves is the destruction of those who are listening. 

2Ti 2:15 Make every effort to present yourself before God as a proven worker who has no need to be ashamed, 
but who keeps the message of truth on a straight path. 

2Ti 2:16 Have nothing to do with godless philosophical discussions — they only lead further and further away 
from true religion. 

2Ti 2:17 Talk of this kind spreads corruption like gangrene, as in the case of Hymenaeus and Philetus, 

2Ti 2:18 the men who have gone astray from the truth, claiming that the resurrection has already taken place. 
They are upsetting some people’s faith. 

2Ti 2:19 However, God’s solid foundation-stone stands firm, and this is the seal on it: “The Lord knows those 
who are his own” and “All who call on the name of the Lord must avoid evil”. 

2Ti 2:20 Not all the dishes in a large house are made of gold and silver; some are made of wood or 
earthenware: the former are held in honour, the latter held cheap. 

2Ti 2:21 If someöne holds himself aloof from these faults I speak of, he will be a vessel held in honour, 
dedicated and fit for the Master, ready for any good work. 

2Ti 2:22 Turn away from the passions of youth, concentrate on uprightness, faith, love and peace, in union with 
all those who call on the Lord with a pure heart. 

2Ti 2:23 Avoid these foolish and undisciplined speculations, understanding that they only give rise to quarrels; 
2Ti 2:24 and a servant of the Lord must not engage in quarrels, but must be kind to everyone, a good teacher, 
and patient. 

2Ti 2:25 He must be gentle when he corrects people who oppose him, in the hope that God may give them a 
change of mind so that they recognise the truth 

2Ti 2:26 and come to their senses, escaping the trap of the devil who made them his captives and subjected 
them to his will. 

2Ti 3:1 You may be quite sure that in the last days there will be some difficult times. 

2Ti 3:2 People will be self-centred and avaricious, boastful, arrogant and rude; disobedient to their parents, 
ungrateful, irreligious; 

2Ti 3:3 heartless and intractable; they will be slanderers, profligates, savages and enemies of everything that is 
good; 

2Ti 3:4 they will be treacherous and reckless and demented by pride, preferring their own pleasure to God. 

2Ti 3:5 They will keep up the outward appearance of religion but will have rejected the inner power of it. Keep 
away from people like that. 

2Ti 3:6 Of the same kind, too, are those men who insinuate themselves into families in order to get influence 
over silly women who are obsessed with their sins and follow one craze after another, 

2Ti 3:7 always seeking learning, but unable ever to come to knowledge of the truth. 

2Ti 3:8 Just as Jannes and Jambres defied Moses, so these men defy the truth, their minds corrupt and their 
faith spurious. 

2Ti 3:9 But they will not be able to go on much longer: their folly, like that of the other two, must become obvious 
to everybody. 

2Ti 3:10 You, though, have followed my teaching, my way of life, my aims, my faith, my patience and my love, 
my perseverance 

2Ti 3:1 1 and the persecutions and sufferings that came to me in places like Antioch, Iconium and Lystra - all 
the persecutions I have endured; and the Lord has rescued me from every one of them. 

2Ti 3:12 But anybody who tries to live in devotion to Christ is certain to be persecuted; 

2Ti 3:13 while these wicked impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving others, and themselves deceived. 

2Ti 3:14 You must keep to what you have been taught and know to be true; remember who your teachers were, 
2Ti 3:15 and how, ever since you were a child, you have known the holy scriptures -from these you can learn 
the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. 

2Ti 3:16 All scripture is inspired by God and useful for refuting error, for guiding people’s lives and teaching 
them to be upright. 

2Ti 3:17 This is how someöne who is dedicated to God becomes fully equipped and ready for any good work. 

2Ti 4:1 Before God and before Christ Jesus who is to be judge of the living and the dead, I charge you, in the 
name of his appearing and of his kingdom: 

2Ti 4:2 proclaim the message and, welcome or unwelcome, insist on it. Refute falsehood, correct error, give 



encouragement — but do all with patience and with care to instruct. 

2Ti 4:3 The time is sure to come when people will not accept sound teaching, but their ears will be itching for 
anything new and they will collect themselves a whole series of teachers according to their own tastes; 

2Ti 4:4 and then they will shut their ears to the truth and will turn to myths. 

2Ti 4:5 But you must keep steady all the time; put up with suffering; do the work of preaching the gospel; fulfil 
the service asked of you. 

2Ti 4:6 As for me, my life is already being poured away as a libation, and the time has come for me to depart. 
2Ti 4:7 I have fought the good fight to the end; I have run the race to the finish; I have kept the faith; 

2Ti 4:8 all there is to come for me now is the crown of uprightness which the Lord, the upright judge, will give to 
me on that Day; and not only to me but to all those who have longed for his appearing. 

2Ti 4:9 Make every effort to come and see me as soon as you can. 

2Ti 4:10 As it is, Demas has deserted me for love of this life and gone to Thessalonica, Crescens has gone to 
Galatia and Titus to Dalmatia; 

2Ti 4:1 1 only Luke is with me. Bring Mark with you; I find him a useful helper in my work. 

2Ti 4:12 I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus. 

2Ti 4:13 When you come, bring the cloak I left with Carpus in Troas, and the scrolls, especially the parchment 
ones. 

2Ti 4:14 Alexander the coppersmith has done me a lot of harm; the Lord will repay him as his deeds deserve. 
2Ti 4:15 Be on your guard against him yourself, because he has been bitterly contesting everything that we say. 
2Ti 4:16 The first time I had to present my defence, no one came into court to support me. Every one of them 
deserted me — may they not be held accountable for it. 

2Ti 4:17 But the Lord stood by me and gave me power, so that through me the message might be fully 
proclaimed for all the gentiles to hear; and so I was saved from the lion’s mouth. 

2Ti 4:18 The Lord will rescue me from all evil attempts on me, and bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom. To 
him be glory for ever and ever. Amen. 

2Ti 4:19 Greetings to Prisca and Aquila, and the family of Onesiphorus. 

2Ti 4:20 Erastus stayed behind at Corinth, and I left Trophimus ill at Miletus. 

2Ti 4:21 Make every effort to come before the winter. Greetings to you from Eubulus, Pudens, Linus, Claudia 
and all the brothers. 

2Ti 4:22 The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.
