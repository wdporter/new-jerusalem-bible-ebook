<h2 id="in">Introduction</h2>

<p>In the thirtieth year, on the fifth day of the fourth month, as I was among the exiles by the River Chebar, heaven opened and I saw visions from God. On the fifth of the month — it was the fifth year of exile for King Jehoiachin —
the word of Yahweh was addressed to the priest Ezekiel son of Buzi, in Chaldaea by the River Chebar. There the hand of Yahweh came on him.</p>

<h4>The vision of the Chariot of Yahweh (1:4–28)</h4>

<p>I looked; a stormy wind blew from the north, a great cloud with flashing fire and brilliant light around it, and in the middle, in the heart of the fire, a brilliance like that of amber, and in the middle what seemed to be four living creatures. They looked like this: They were of human form. Each had four faces, each had four wings. Their legs were straight; they had hooves like calves, glittering like polished brass. Below their wings, they had human hands on all four sides corresponding to their four faces and four wings. They touched one another with their wings; they did not turn as they moved; each one moved straight forward. As to the appearance of their faces, all four had a human face, and a lion’s face to the right, and all four had a bull’s face to the left, and all four had an eagle’s face. Their wings were spread upwards, each had one pair touching its neighbour’s, and the other pair covering its body. And each one moved straight forward; they went where the spirit urged them, they did not turn as they moved.</p>

<p>Between these living creatures were what looked like blazing coals, like torches, darting backwards and forwards between the living creatures; the fire gave a brilliant light, and lightning flashed from the fire, and the living creatures kept disappearing and reäppearing like flashes of lightning.</p>

<p>Now, as I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel touching the ground beside each of the four-faced living creatures. The appearance and structure of the wheels were like glittering chrysolite. All four looked alike, and their appearance and structure were such that each wheel seemed to have another wheel inside it. In whichever of the four directions they moved, they did not need to turn as they moved. Their circumference was of awe-inspiring size, and the rims of all four sparkled all the way around. When the living creatures moved, the wheels moved beside them; and when the living creatures left the ground, the wheels too left the ground. They moved in whichever direction the spirit chose to go, and the wheels rose with them, since the wheels shared the spirit of the animals. When the living creatures moved on, they moved on; when the former halted, the latter halted; when the former left the ground, the wheels too left the ground, since the wheels shared the spirit of the animals. Over the heads of the living creatures was what looked like a solid surface glittering like crystal, spread out over their heads, above them, and under the solid surface, their wings were spread out straight, touching one another, and each had a pair covering its body. I also heard the noise of their wings; when they moved, it was like the noise of flood-waters, like the voice of Shaddai, like the noise of a storm, like the noise of an armed camp; and when they halted, they lowered their wings; there was a noise too.</p>

<p>Beyond the solid surface above their heads, there was what seemed like a sapphire, in the form of a throne. High above on the form of a throne was a form with the appearance of a human being.</p>

<p>I saw a brilliance like amber, like fire, radiating from what appeared to be the waist upwards; and from what appeared to be the waist downwards, I saw what looked like fire, giving a brilliant light all around. The radiance of the encircling light was like the radiance of the bow in the clouds on rainy days. The sight was like the glory of Yahweh. I looked and fell to the ground, and I heard the voice of someöne speaking to me.</p>

<h4 id="ch2">The vision of the scroll (2:1–3:15)</h4>

<p>He said, “Son of man, get to your feet; I will speak to you”. As he said these words the spirit came into me and put me on my feet, and I heard him speaking to me. He said, “Son of man, I am sending you to the Israelites, to the rebels who have rebelled against me. They and their ancestors have been in revolt against me up to the present day. Because they are stubborn and obstinate children, I am sending you to them, to say, ‘Lord Yahweh says this’. Whether they listen or not, this tribe of rebels will know there is a prophet among them. And you, son of man, do not be afraid of them or of what they say, though you find yourself surrounded with brambles and sitting on scorpions. Do not be afraid of their words or alarmed by their looks, for they are a tribe of rebels. You are to deliver my words to them whether they listen or not, for they are a tribe of rebels. But you, son of man, are to listen to what I say to you; do not be a rebel like that rebellious tribe. Open your mouth and eat what I am about to give you”.</p>

<p>When I looked, there was a hand stretching out to me, holding a scroll. He unrolled it in front of me; it was written on, front and back; on it was written “Lamentations, dirges and cries of grief”.</p>

<p id="ch3">He then said, “Son of man, eat what you see; eat this scroll, then go and speak to the House of Israel”. I opened my mouth; he gave me the scroll to eat and then said, “Son of man, feed on this scroll which I am giving you and eat your fill”. So I ate it, and it tasted sweet as honey.</p>

<p>He then said, “Son of man, go to the House of Israel and tell them what I have said. You are not being sent to a nation that speaks a difficult foreign language; you are being sent to the House of Israel. Not to big nations that speak difficult foreign languages, and whose words you would not understand — if I sent you to them, they would listen to you; but the House of Israel will not listen to you because it will not listen to me. The whole House of Israel is defiant and obstinate. But now, I am making you as defiant as they are, and as obstinate as they are; I am making your resolution as hard as a diamond, harder than flint. So do not be afraid of them, do not be overawed by them, for they are a tribe of rebels”.</p>

<p>Then he said, “Son of man, take to heart everything I say to you, listen carefully, then go to your exiled countrymen and talk to them. Say to them, ‘Lord Yahweh says this’, whether they listen or not”.</p>

<p>The spirit lifted me up, and behind me I heard a great vibrating sound, “Blessed be the glory of Yahweh in his dwelling-place!”. This was the sound of the living creatures’ wings beating against each other, and the sound of the wheels beside them: a great vibrating sound. The spirit lifted me up and took me, and I went, bitter and angry, and the hand of Yahweh lay heavy on me. I came to Tel Abib, to the exiles beside the River Chebar where they were living, and there I stayed with them in a stupor for seven days.</p>

<h4>The prophet as watchman (3:16–21)</h4>

<p>After seven days the word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows, “Son of man, I have appointed you as watchman for the House of Israel. When you hear a word from my mouth, warn them from me. If I say to someöne wicked, ‘You will die’, and you do not warn this person; if you do not speak to warn someöne wicked to renounce evil and so save his life, it is the wicked person who will die for the guilt, but I shall hold you responsible for that death. If, however, you do warn someöne wicked who then fails to renounce wickedness and evil ways, the wicked person will die for the guilt, but you yourself will have saved your life. When someöne upright renounces uprightness to do evil and I set a trap for him, it is he who will die; since you failed to warn him, he will die for his guilt, and the uprightness he practised will no longer be remembered; but I shall hold you responsible for his death. If, however, you warn someöne upright not to sin and this person does not sin, such a one will live, thanks to your warning, and you too will have saved your life”.</p>

<h2 id="i">I: Before the Siege of Jerusalem (3:22–24:27)</h2>

<h4>Ezekiel is struck dumb (3:22–27)</h4>

<p>While I was there the hand of Yahweh came on me; he said, “Get up, go out into the valley, and there I shall speak to you”. I got up and went out into the valley; the glory of Yahweh was resting there, like the glory I had seen by the River Chebar, and I fell to the ground. The spirit of Yahweh then entered me and put me on my feet and spoke to me. He said, “Go and shut yourself in your house. Son of man, you are about to be tied and bound, and unable to mix with other people. I am going to make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth; you will be dumb, and no longer able to reprove them, for they are a tribe of rebels. When I speak to you, however, I shall open your mouth and then you will say to them, ‘Lord Yahweh says this: Let anyone prepared to listen, listen; let anyone who refuses, refuse!’ — for they are a tribe of rebels”.</p>

<h4 id="ch4">The siege of Jerusalem foretold (4:1–5:17)</h4>

<p>“For your part, son of man, take a brick and lay it in front of you; on it scratch a city, Jerusalem. You are then to besiege it, trench around it, build earthworks, pitch camps and bring up battering-rams all around. Then take an iron pan and place it as though it were an iron wall between you and the city. Then fix your gaze on it; it is being besieged and you are besieging it. This is a sign for the House of Israel.</p>

<p>“Lie down on your left side and take the guilt of the House of Israel on yourself. You will bear their guilt for as many days as you lie on that side. Allowing one day for every year of their guilt, I ordain that you bear it for three hundred and ninety days; this is how you will bear the House of Israel’s guilt. And when you have finished doing this, you are to lie down again, on your right side, and bear the guilt of the House of Judah for forty days. I have set the length for you as one day for one year. Then fix your gaze on the siege of Jerusalem, raise your bared arm and prophesy against her. Look, I am going to tie you up and you will not be able to turn over from one side to the other until the period of your seclusion is over.</p>

<p>“Now take wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet and spelt; put them all in the same pot and make them into bread for yourself. You are to eat it for as many days as you are lying on your side — three hundred and ninety days. Of this food, you are to weigh out a daily portion of twenty shekels and eat it a little piece at a time. And you are to ration the water you drink — a sixth of a <i>hin</i> — drinking that a little at a time. You are to eat this in the form of a barley cake baked where they can see you, on human dung”. And Yahweh said, “This is how the Israelites will have to eat their defiled food, wherever I disperse them among the nations”.</p>

<p>I then said, “Lord Yahweh, my soul is not defiled. From my childhood until now, I have never eaten an animal that has died a natural death or been savaged; no tainted meat has ever entered my mouth”.</p>

<p>“Very well”, he said, “I grant you cow-dung instead of human dung; you are to bake your bread on that”. He then said, “Son of man, I am going to cut off Jerusalem’s food supply; in their extremity, the food they eat will be weighed out; to their horror, the water they drink will be rationed, until there is no food or water left, and they fall into a stupor and waste away because of their guilt”.</p>

<p id="ch5">“Son of man, take a sharp sword, use it like a barber’s razor and run it over your head and beard. Then take scales and divide the hair you have cut off. Burn one-third inside the city, while the days of the siege are working themselves out. Then take another third and chop it up with the sword all around the city. The last third you are to scatter to the wind, while I unsheathe the sword behind them. Also take a few hairs and tie them up in the folds of your cloak; and of these again take a few, and throw them on the fire and burn them. From them fire will come on the whole House of Israel.</p>

<p>“The Lord Yahweh says this, ‘This is Jerusalem, which I have placed in the middle of the nations, surrounded with foreign countries. She has rebelled more perversely against my observances than the nations have, and against my laws than the surrounding countries have; for they have rejected my observances and not kept my laws’.</p>

<p>“Therefore, the Lord Yahweh says this, ‘Because your disorders are worse than those of the nations around you, since you do not keep my laws or respect my observances, and since you do not respect even the observances of the surrounding nations, very well, the Lord Yahweh says this: I, too, am against you and shall execute my judgements on you for the nations to see. Because of all your loathsome practices I shall do such things as I have never done before, nor shall ever do again. Those of you who are parents will eat their children, and children will eat their parents. I shall execute judgement on you and disperse what remains of you to the winds. For, as I live — declares Lord Yahweh — as sure as you have defiled my sanctuary with all your horrors and all your loathsome practices, so I too shall reject you without a glance of pity, I shall not spare you. A third of your citizens will die of plague or starve to death inside you; a third will fall by the sword around you; and a third I shall scatter to the winds, unsheathing the sword behind them. I shall sate my anger and bring my fury to rest on them until I am avenged; and when I have sated my fury on them, then they will know that I, Yahweh, spoke out of jealousy for you. Yes, I shall reduce you to a ruin, an object of derision to the surrounding nations, in the eyes of all who pass by. You will be an object of derision and insults, an example, an object of amazement to the surrounding nations, when I execute judgement on you in furious anger and furious punishments. I, Yahweh, have spoken. On them I shall send the deadly arrows of famine, which will destroy you — for I shall send them to destroy you; then I shall make the famine worse and cut off your food supply. I shall send famine and wild animals on you to rob you of your children; plague and bloodshed will sweep through you, and I shall bring the sword down on you. I, Yahweh, have spoken’”.</p>

<h4 id="ch6">Against the mountains of Israel (6:1–10)</h4>

<p>The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows, “Son of man, turn towards the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them. Say, ‘Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Yahweh. The Lord Yahweh says this to mountains and hills and ravines and valleys: Look, I am going to summon the sword against you and destroy your high places. Your altars will be wrecked, and your incense burners smashed; I shall fling your butchered inhabitants down in front of your foul idols; I shall lay the corpses of the Israelites in front of their foul idols and scatter their bones all around your altars. Wherever you live, the towns will be destroyed and the high places wrecked, to the ruin and wrecking of your altars, the shattering and abolition of your foul idols, the smashing of your incense burners and the utter destruction of all your works. As the butchered fall about you, you will know that I am Yahweh.</p>

<p>‘But I shall spare some of you to escape the sword among the nations, when you have been dispersed in their lands; and your survivors will remember me among the nations where they are held captive, since I shall have broken their adulterous hearts for having deserted me, and destroyed their eyes for having turned adulterously towards their foul idols. They will loathe themselves for all the wrong they have caused by their loathsome practices. Then they will know that I am Yahweh and that I was not talking lightly when I said that I would inflict these disasters on them’.</p>

<h4>The sins of Israel (6:11–14)</h4>

<p>“The Lord Yahweh says this, ‘Clap your hands, stamp your feet, and say: Alas for all the loathsome sins of the House of Israel, which is about to fall by sword, famine and plague! Far off, they will die by plague; near at hand they will fall by the sword; and any who survive or are spared will die of famine. This is how I shall sate my fury on them. Then you will know that I am Yahweh, when their butchered corpses lie among their foul idols, all around their altars, on every high hill, on every mountain top, under every green tree, under every leafy oak, wherever they offer a smell pleasing to all their idols. I shall point my finger at them and reduce the country to an empty wasteland from the desert to Riblah, everywhere they live, and they will know that I am Yahweh’”.</p>

<h4 id="ch7">The end is near (7:1–14)</h4>

<p>The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows, “Son of man, say, ‘Lord Yahweh says this to the land of Israel: Finished! The end is coming for the four corners of the country. This is the end for you; I shall unleash my anger on you, and judge you as your conduct deserves and call you to account for all your loathsome practices. I shall show you no pity, I shall not spare you; I shall repay you for your conduct and for the loathsome practices in which you persist. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.</p>

<p>‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Disaster, a unique disaster, is coming. The end is coming, the end is coming, it is on the move towards you, it is coming now. Now it is your turn, you who dwell in this country. Doom is coming, the day is near; no joy now, only tumult, on the mountains. Now I shall soon vent my fury on you and sate my anger on you: I shall judge you as your conduct deserves and repay you for all your loathsome practices. I shall show neither pity nor mercy, but shall repay you for your conduct and the loathsome practices in which you persist. Then you will know that I am Yahweh and that I strike.</p>

<p>‘Now is the day, your turn has come, it has come, it appears, the sceptre has blossomed, pride is at its peak. Violence has risen to become the scourge of wickedness … Doom is coming, the day is near. Neither should buyer rejoice, nor seller regret, for the fury rests on everyone alike. The seller will not be able to go back on his bargain; each persists in his sins; they take no defensive measures. The trumpet sounds, all is ready, but no one goes into battle, since my fury rests on all alike.</p>

<h4>The sins of Israel (7:15–27)</h4>

<p>‘Outside, the sword; inside, plague and famine. Whoëver is living in the countryside will die by the sword; whoëver is living in the city will be devoured by famine and plague. And those who escape will escape to the mountains and there, like doves of the valleys, I shall slaughter them all, each one for his sin. Every hand will grow limp, every knee turn to water. They will put on sackcloth, each one trembling. Every face will be ashamed and every head be shaved. They will throw their silver away in the streets and their gold they will regard as a pollution; neither their silver nor their gold will be able to save them on the day of Yahweh’s fury. Never again will they have enough to eat, never again will they fill their bellies, since that was the occasion for their guilt. They used to pride themselves on the beauty of their jewellery, out of which they made their loathsome images, their horrors; so now I have made it pollute them. I shall hand it over as plunder to foreigners, as loot to the most evil people on earth. They will profane it. I shall turn my face away from them, while my treasure-house is profaned and robbers will force their way in and profane it.</p>

<p>‘Forge yourself a chain; for the country is full of bloody executions and the city full of deeds of violence, so I shall bring the cruellest of the nations to seize their houses. I shall put an end to the pride of their elite, and their sanctuary will be profaned. Terror is on the way: they will look for peace and there will be none. Disaster will follow on disaster, rumour on rumour; they will pester the prophet for a vision; the priest will be at a loss over the law and the elders on how to advise. The king will go into mourning, the prince be plunged in grief, the hands of the country people tremble. I shall treat them as their conduct deserves, and judge them as their own verdicts merit. Then they will know that I am Yahweh!’.</p>

<h4 id="ch8">A vision of the sins of Jerusalem (8:1–18)</h4>

<p>In the sixth year, on the fifth day of the sixth month, I was sitting at home and the elders of Judah were sitting with me, when suddenly the hand of the Lord Yahweh fell on me there.</p>

<p>I looked, and there was a form with the appearance of a human being. Downwards from what seemed to be the waist there was fire; and upwards from the waist there was a brilliance like the glitter of amber. Something like a hand was stretched out and it took me by a lock of my hair; and the spirit lifted me between heaven and earth and, in visions from God, took me to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the inner north gate, where stands the idol that provokes jealousy. There was the glory of the God of Israel; it looked like what I had seen in the valley. He said, “Son of man, raise your eyes to the north”. I raised my eyes to the north, and there, to the north of the altar gate, stood this statue of jealousy at the entrance. He said, “Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the monstrous, loathsome things that the House of Israel is practising here, to drive me out of my sanctuary? And you will see practices more loathsome still”.</p>

<p>He next took me to the entrance to the court. I looked; there was a hole in the wall. He said, “Son of man, bore through the wall”. I bored through the wall, until I had made an opening. He said, “Go in and look at the loathsome things they are doing inside”. I went in and looked and there was every kind of reptile and repulsive animal, and all the foul idols of the House of Israel, carved all around the walls. Seventy elders of the House of Israel were worshipping the idols — among them Jaazaniah son of Shaphan — each one with his censer in his hand, from which rose a fragrant cloud of incense. He said, “Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the House of Israel do in the dark, each in his personal image-shrine? They say, ‘Yahweh cannot see us; Yahweh has abandoned the country’”. He said, “You will see them at practices more loathsome still”.</p>

<p>He next took me to the entrance of the north gate of the Temple of Yahweh where women were sitting, weeping for Tammuz. He said, “Son of man, do you see that? You will see even more loathsome things than that”.</p>

<p>He then led me to the inner court of the Temple of Yahweh. And there, at the entrance to Yahweh’s sanctuary, between the portico and the altar, there were about twenty-five men, with their backs to Yahweh’s sanctuary and their faces turned towards the east. They were prostrating themselves to the east, before the rising sun. He said to me, “Son of man, do you see that? Is it not bad enough for the House of Judah to be doing the loathsome things they are doing here? But they fill the country with violence and provoke my anger further; look at them now putting that branch to their nostrils. And so I shall reäct in fury; I shall show neither pity nor mercy. They may cry as loudly as they like to me; I will not listen”.</p>

<h4 id="ch9">The punishment (9:1–10:17)</h4>

<p>Then he shouted loudly for me to hear, “The scourges of the city are approaching, each carrying his weapon of destruction!”. Immediately six men advanced from the upper north gate, each holding a deadly weapon. Among them was a man dressed in linen, with a scribe’s ink-horn in his belt. They came in and halted in front of the bronze altar. The glory of the God of Israel rose from above the winged creature where it had been, towards the threshold of the Temple. He called to the man dressed in linen with a scribe’s ink-horn in his belt and Yahweh said to him, “Go all through the city, all through Jerusalem, and mark a cross on the foreheads of all who grieve and lament over all the loathsome practices in it”. I heard him say to the others, “Follow him through the city and strike. Not one glance of pity; show no mercy; old men, young men, girls, children, women, kill and exterminate them all. But do not touch anyone with a cross on his forehead. Begin at my sanctuary”. So they began with the old men who were in the Temple. He said to them, “Defile the Temple; fill the courts with corpses; then go out!”. They went out and hacked their way through the city.</p>

<p>While they were hacking them down, I was left alone; I fell on my face, crying out, “Ah, Lord Yahweh, are you going to annihilate all that is left of Israel by venting your fury on Jerusalem?”.</p>
	
<p>He said, “The guilt of the House of Israel and Judah is immense; the country is full of bloodshed, the city full of perversity, for they say, ‘Yahweh has abandoned the country, Yahweh cannot see’. Then, I too shall neither give one glance of pity nor show any mercy. I shall repay them for what they have done”.</p>

<p>The man dressed in linen with the scribe’s ink-horn in his belt then came back and made his report, “I have carried out your orders”.</p>

<p id="ch10">Then, in vision I saw that above the solid surface over the heads of the winged creatures there was above them something like sapphire, which seemed to be like a throne. He then said to the man dressed in linen, “Go in between the wheels below the winged creatures; take a handful of burning coal from between the winged creatures and scatter it over the city”. He went in as I watched.</p>

<p>The winged creatures were on the right of the Temple as the man went in, and the cloud filled the inner court. The glory of Yahweh rose from above the winged creatures, towards the threshold of the Temple; the Temple was filled by the cloud and the court was full of the brightness of the glory of Yahweh. The noise of the winged creatures’ wings could be heard even in the outer court, like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.</p>

<p>When he had given the order to the man dressed in linen, “Take the fire from between the wheels, between the winged creatures”, the man went in and stood by one of the wheels. One of the winged creatures then reached his hand out towards the fire between the winged creatures, took some of it and put it into the hands of the man dressed in linen, who took it and came out again.</p>

<p>There appeared to be what looked like a human hand under the winged creatures’ wings. And I looked, and there were four wheels beside the winged creatures, one wheel beside each winged creature, and the appearance of the wheels was like the sparkle of chrysolite. In appearance, all four looked alike, as though each wheel had another wheel inside it.</p>

<p>In whichever of the four directions they moved, they did not need to turn as they moved, but whichever way the head was facing there they followed; they did not turn as they moved, and their entire bodies, their backs, their hands, their wings, as well as the wheels, had eyes all the way around (the wheels of all four). In my hearing, these wheels were called “galgal”. Each had four faces; the first was a winged creature’s face, the second a human face, the third a lion’s face and the fourth an eagle’s face. The winged creatures rose; this was the being I had seen by the River Chebar. When the winged creatures moved, the wheels moved beside them; and when the winged creatures raised their wings to leave the ground, the wheels did not turn beside them. When the former halted the latter halted; when the former rose, the latter rose with them, since they shared the same living spirit.</p>

<h4>The glory of Yahweh leaves the Temple (10:18–22)</h4>

<p>The glory of Yahweh then came out over the Temple threshold and paused over the winged creatures. These raised their wings and rose from the ground as I watched, and the wheels were beside them. They paused at the entrance to the east gate of the Temple of Yahweh, with the glory of the God of Israel over them, above. This was the winged creature I had seen beneath the God of Israel by the River Chebar; I knew that they were winged creatures. Each had four faces and four wings and what seemed to be human hands under their wings. Their faces were like those I had seen by the River Chebar. Each one moved straight forward.</p>

<h4 id="ch11">The sins of Jerusalem (continued) (11:1–13)</h4>

<p>The spirit lifted me up and brought me to the east gate of the Temple of Yahweh, the gate that looks eastwards. There at the entrance to the gate stood twenty-five men, among whom I saw Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, leaders of the people.</p>

<p>He said to me, “Son of man, these are the wicked schemers who are spreading their bad advice through this city. They say, ‘There will be no house-building yet awhile. The city is the cooking pot and we are the meat’. So prophesy against them, prophesy, son of man!”.</p>

<p>The spirit of Yahweh fell on me, and he said to me, “Say, ‘Yahweh says this: I know what you are saying, House of Israel, I know how insolent you are. You have filled this city with more and more of your victims; you have strewn its streets with victims. And so the Lord Yahweh says this: Your victims, whom you have put in it, are the meat, and the city is the cooking pot; but I shall take you out of it. You are afraid of the sword and I shall bring the sword down on you — declares the Lord Yahweh — and I shall take you out of it and hand you over to foreigners and bring you to justice; you will fall by the sword on the soil of Israel; I shall execute justice on you, and you will know that I am Yahweh. This city will be no cooking pot for you, nor will you be the meat inside; I shall execute justice on you on the soil of Israel; and you will know that I am Yahweh, whose laws you have not obeyed and whose judgements you have not kept; instead, you have adopted the customs of the nations around you’”.</p>

<p>Now as I was prophesying, Pelatiah son of Benaiah dropped dead. I fell to the ground and cried out, “Ah, Lord Yahweh, are you going to annihilate the remnant of Israel?”.</p>

<h4>The new covenant promised to the exiles (11:14–21)</h4>

<p>The word of Yahweh was then addressed to me as follows, “Son of man, to your brothers one and all, to your kinsfolk and to the whole House of Israel, the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, ‘Keep well away from Yahweh. This country has now been made over to us!’. So say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Yes, I have sent them far away among the nations and I have dispersed them to foreign countries; and for a while I have been a sanctuary for them in the country to which they have gone’. So say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: I shall gather you back from the peoples, I shall collect you in from the countries where you have been scattered and give you the land of Israel. When they come back, they will purge it of all its horrors and loathsome practices. I shall give them a single heart and I shall put a new spirit in them; I shall remove the heart of stone from their bodies and give them a heart of flesh, so that they can keep my laws and respect my judgements and put them into practice. Then they will be my people and I shall be their God. But those whose hearts are set on their horrors and loathsome practices I shall repay for their conduct — declares the Lord Yahweh’”.</p>

<h4>The glory of Yahweh leaves Jerusalem (11:22–25)</h4>

<p>The winged creatures then raised their wings and the wheels moved with them, with the glory of the God of Israel over them, above. And the glory of Yahweh rose from the centre of the city and halted on the mountain to the east of the city.</p>

<p>Then the spirit lifted me up and took me, in vision, in the spirit of God, to the exiles in Chaldaea, and the vision which I had seen faded. I then told the exiles everything that Yahweh had shown me.</p>

<h4 id="ch12">The mime of the exile (12:1–20)</h4>

<p>The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows: “Son of man, you are living among a tribe of rebels who have eyes and never see, they have ears and never hear, because they are a tribe of rebels. So, son of man, pack an exile’s bundle and set off for exile by daylight while they watch. You will leave your home and go somewhere else while they watch. Then perhaps they will see that they are a tribe of rebels. You will pack your baggage like an exile’s bundle, by daylight, while they watch, and leave like an exile in the evening, while they watch. While they watch, make a hole in the wall, and go out through it. While they watch, you will shoulder your pack and go out into the dark; you will cover your face so that you cannot see the ground, since I have made you an omen for the House of Israel”.</p>

<p>I did as I had been told. I packed my baggage like an exile’s bundle, by daylight; and in the evening I made a hole through the wall with my hands; then I went out into the dark and shouldered my pack while they watched.</p>

<p>Next morning the word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows: “Son of man, did not the House of Israel, did not that tribe of rebels, ask you, ‘What are you doing?’? Say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: This prophecy concerns Jerusalem and the whole House of Israel who live there’. Say, ‘I am an omen for you; as I have done, so will be done to them; they will be deported into exile. Their prince will shoulder his pack in the dark and go out through the wall; a hole will be made to let him out; he will cover his face, so that he cannot see the country. I shall throw my net over him and catch him in my mesh; I shall take him to Babylon, to the land of the Chaldaeans, though he will not see it; and there he will die. And all those in attendance on him, his army and all his troops, I shall scatter to all the winds and unsheathe the sword behind them. Then they will know that I am Yahweh, when I scatter them throughout the nations and disperse them in foreign countries. But I shall let a few of them escape the sword, famine and plague, to describe all their loathsome practices to the peoples among whom they will go, so that these too may know that I am Yahweh’”.</p>

<p>The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows: “Son of man, you are to tremble as you eat your food and shudder apprehensively as you drink your water, and you are to say to the people of the country, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. They will shudder apprehensively as they eat their food, and drink their water in fear, so that the country and its population may be freed from the violence of its inhabitants. When the populous cities have been destroyed and the country has been reduced to desert, then you will know that I am Yahweh’”.</p>

<h4>Popular proverbs (12:21–28)</h4>

<p>The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows: “Son of man, what do you understand by the saying pronounced over the land of Israel, ‘Days go by and visions fade’?</p>

<p>“Very well, tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: I shall put an end to this saying; it will never be used in Israel again’. Instead, tell them:</p>

<p>‘The days are coming when every vision will come true, for there will be no more futile visions or deceptive prophecy in the House of Israel, since I, Yahweh, shall speak. And what I shall say will come true without delay; for what I shall say, I shall perform in your own lifetime, you tribe of rebels — declares the Lord Yahweh’”.</p>

<p>The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows: “Son of man, the House of Israel is now saying, ‘The vision that this man sees concerns the distant future; he is prophesying for times far ahead’. Very well, tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: There will be no further delay in the fulfilling of any of my words. What I have said shall be done now — declares the Lord Yahweh’”.</p>

<h4 id="ch13">Against the false prophets (13:1)</h4>

<p>The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows: “Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel; prophesy, and say to those who make up prophecies out of their own heads, ‘Hear what Yahweh says: The Lord Yahweh says this: Disaster is in store for the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing! Your prophets, Israel, are like ruin-haunting jackals!</p>

<p>‘You have not ventured into the breach; you have not built up the wall around the House of Israel, to hold fast in battle on the Day of Yahweh. Theirs are futile visions and false predictions, who say: A prophecy from Yahweh, when Yahweh has not sent them; yet they expect their words to come true. Have not the visions you see been futile, have not the predictions you make been false, although you say: A prophecy of Yahweh, when I have not spoken?</p>

<p>‘Very well, the Lord Yahweh says this: Because of your futile words and false predictions, I am now against you — declares Lord Yahweh. My hand will be against the prophets who have futile visions and give false predictions; they will not be admitted to the council of my people, their names will not be entered in the roll of the House of Israel, they will not set foot on the soil of Israel; and they will know that I am the Lord Yahweh. This is because they have misled my people by saying, “Peace!”, when there is no peace. When my people were repairing a wall, these men came and plastered it over! Tell these plasterers: It will rain hard, it will hail, it will blow a gale, and down will come the wall! Will not people ask you: What has become of the plaster you slapped on it? Well then, the Lord Yahweh says this: I am going to unleash a stormy wind in my fury, torrential rain in my anger, hailstones in my destructive fury, and I shall shatter the wall you plastered and knock it down and lay its foundations bare. It will fall and you will perish under it; then you will know that I am Yahweh’.</p>

<p>“When I have sated my anger on the wall and those who plastered it, I shall say to you, ‘The wall is gone, and so are those who plastered over it, the prophets of Israel who prophesy about Jerusalem and have visions of peace for her when there is no peace — declares the Lord Yahweh’.</p>

<h4>Against false prophetesses (13:17–23)</h4>

<p>“Also, son of man, turn to the women of your people who make up prophecies out of their own heads; prophesy against them. Say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Disaster is in store for women who sew ribbons around each wrist and make head-cloths for people of all sizes, in their hunt for souls! Are you to hunt the souls of my people and keep your own souls safe? You dishonour me in front of my people for a few handfuls of barley, a few bits of bread, killing those who ought not to die and sparing those who ought not to live, lying to my people who love listening to lies.</p>

<p>‘Very well, the Lord Yahweh says this: Look, I am now against your ribbons, with which you hunt souls like birds, and I shall tear them off your arms and free those souls whom you hunt like birds. I shall tear your head-cloths to pieces and rescue my people from your clutches; no longer will they be fair game for you to ensnare. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.</p>

<p>‘For having intimidated with lies the heart of the upright whom I had done nothing to alarm, and for having encouraged the wicked not to give up wicked ways and so be saved, very well, you will have no more futile visions and make no more predictions, for I shall rescue my people from your clutches, and you will know that I am Yahweh’”.</p>

<h4 id="ch14">Against idolatry (14:1–11)</h4>

<p>Next, some elders of Israel visited me and while they were sitting with me, the word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows, “Son of man, these men have enshrined their foul idols in their hearts and placed the cause of their sinning right before their eyes. Why should I let myself be consulted by them? So speak to them; tell them this, ‘Lord Yahweh says this: Every member of the House of Israel who enshrines his foul idols in his heart and places the cause of his sinning right before his eyes, and who then approaches the prophet, will get this answer from me, Yahweh, as the multiplicity of his idols deserves, and in this way I hope to win back the hearts of the House of Israel who have all been estranged from me by their foul idols’.</p>

<p>“So say to the House of Israel, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Come back, turn away from your foul idols, turn your backs on all your loathsome practices; for if any member of the House of Israel — or any foreigner living in Israel — deserts me to enshrine his foul idols in his heart and places the cause of his sinning right before his eyes and then approaches a prophet to consult me through him, he will get his answer from me, Yahweh. I shall set my face against that person; I shall make him an example and a byword; I shall rid my people of him, and you will know that I am Yahweh. And if the prophet is seduced into saying something, I, Yahweh, shall have seduced that prophet; I shall point my finger at him and rid my people Israel of him. Both will be punished for their guilt; the prophet’s punishment will be the same as that of the person who consults him, so that the House of Israel will never stray from me again or defile themselves again with these crimes, but be my people and I their God — declares the Lord Yahweh’”.</p>

<h4>Individual responsibility (14:12–23)</h4>

<p>The word of Yahweh was addressed to me: “Son of man, when a country sins against me by being unfaithful and I point my finger at it and destroy its supply of food, inflicting famine on it and denuding it of human and animal, even if the three men, Noah, Danel and Job, were living in it, they would save no one but themselves by their uprightness — declares the Lord Yahweh. Were I to unleash wild beasts on that country to rob it of its children and reduce it to a desert which no one would dare to cross because of the animals, even if these three men were living there, as I live — declares the Lord Yahweh — they would not be able to save either son or daughter; they alone would be saved, and the country would become a desert. Were I to bring the sword down on that country and say, ‘Sword, cross the country!’, so as to denude it of human and animal, even if these three men were living there, as I live — declares the Lord Yahweh — they would not be able to save either son or daughter; they alone would be saved. If I were to send the plague on that country and vent my fury on it by bloodshed, so as to denude it of human and animal, even if Noah and Danel and Job were living there, as I live — declares the Lord Yahweh — they would be able to save neither son nor daughter, only themselves by their uprightness.</p>

<p>“The Lord Yahweh says this, ‘Even if I send my four dreadful scourges on Jerusalem — sword, famine, wild beasts and plague — to denude it of human and animal, even so, there will be a remnant left, a few men and women who come through; when they come to you and you see their conduct and actions, you will take comfort in spite of the disaster which I have brought on Jerusalem, in spite of all I have brought on her. They will comfort you, when you see their conduct and actions, and so you will know that I have not done in vain all I have done to her — declares the Lord Yahweh’”.</p>

<h4 id="ch15">A parable of the vine (15:1–8)</h4>

<p>The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Son of man, how is the wood of the vine better</span><br />
		<span>than wood from the branch of a forest tree?</span><br />
		<span>Is its wood used for making anything?</span><br />
		<span>Are pegs on which to hang things made from it?</span><br />
		<span>There it is, thrown on the fire for fuel.</span><br />
		<span>The fire burns off both ends;</span><br />
		<span>the middle is charred; can it be kept for anything now?</span><br />
		<span>While it was intact, you could make nothing with it;</span><br />
		<span>burned and charred, is it any more useful now?</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, the Lord Yahweh says this:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>As the wood of the vine among the forest trees,</span><br />
		<span>which I have thrown on the fire for fuel,</span><br />
		<span>so shall I treat the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span><br />
		<span>I shall set my face against them.</span><br />
		<span>They have escaped one fire, but fire will devour them yet.</span><br />
		<span>And you will know that I am Yahweh, when I set my face against them.</span><br />
		<span>I shall reduce the country to a desert, because of their infidelity —</span><br />
		<span>declares the Lord Yahweh.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="ch16">An allegorical history of Jerusalem (16:1–63)</h4>

<p>The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows, “Son of man, confront Jerusalem with her loathsome practices! Say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: By origin and birth you belong to the land of Canaan. Your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite. At birth, the very day you were born, there was no one to cut your navel-string, or wash you in water to clean you, or rub you with salt, or wrap you in swaddling clothes. No one looked at you with pity enough to do any of these things out of sympathy for you. You were exposed in the open fields in your own dirt on the day you were born.</p>

<p>‘I saw you kicking on the ground in your blood as I was passing, and I said to you as you lay in your blood: Live! And I made you grow like the grass of the fields. You developed, you grew, you reached marriageable age. Your breasts became firm and your hair grew richly, but you were stark naked. Then I saw you as I was passing. Your time had come, the time for love. I spread my cloak over you and covered your nakedness; I gave you my oath, I made a covenant with you — declares the Lord Yahweh — and you became mine. I bathed you in water, I washed the blood off you, I anointed you with oil. I gave you embroidered dresses, fine leather shoes, a linen headband and a cloak of silk. I loaded you with jewels, gave you bracelets for your wrists and a necklace for your throat. I gave you nose-ring and earrings; I put a beautiful diadem on your head. You were loaded with gold and silver and dressed in linen and silk and brocade. Your food was the finest flour, honey and oil. You grew more and more beautiful; and you rose to be queen. The fame of your beauty spread through the nations, since it was perfect, because I had clothed you with my own splendour — declares the Lord Yahweh.
</p>

<p>‘But you became infatuated with your own beauty and used your fame to play the whore, lavishing your debauchery on all comers. You took some of your clothes to make for yourself high places bright with colours and there you played the whore. You also took your jewellery, made with my gold and silver which I had given you, and made yourself male images to serve your whorings. You took your embroidered clothes and used these to dress them up, and you offered them my oil and my incense. And the bread I gave you, the finest flour, the oil and honey with which I fed you, you offered them as a pleasing smell.</p>

<p>‘What is more — declares the Lord Yahweh — you took the sons and daughters you had borne me and sacrificed them as food to the images. Was not your whoring enough in itself, for you to slaughter my children and hand them over to be burnt in their honour? And in all your loathsome practices and your whorings you never called your early days to mind, when you were stark naked, kicking on the ground in your own blood.</p>

<p>‘To crown your wickedness — disaster upon you, disaster! declares the Lord Yahweh — you built yourself a mound and made yourself a high place in every open space. At the entry to every alley you made yourself a high place, defiling your beauty and opening your legs to all comers in countless acts of fornication. You have also fornicated with your big-membered neighbours, the Egyptians, provoking my anger with further acts of fornication. So now I have raised my hand against you, I have cut down on your food, I have put you at the mercy of your enemies, the Philistine women, who blush at your lewd behaviour. Still unsatisfied, you prostituted yourself to the Assyrians; you played the whore with them, but were not satisfied even then. You committed further acts of fornication in the country of merchants, with the Chaldaeans, and these did not satisfy you either.</p>

<p>‘How simple-minded you are! — declares the Lord Yahweh — for although you do all the things that a professional prostitute would, in building a mound and making yourself a high place in every street, you do not act like a proper prostitute because you disdain to take a fee. An adulteress welcomes strangers instead of her husband. All prostitutes accept presents, but you give presents to all your lovers, you bribe them to come from all over the place to fornicate with you! In fornicating, you are the opposite of other women, since no one runs after you to fornicate with you; since you give the fee and do not get one, you are the very opposite!</p>

<p>‘Very well, whore, hear the word of Yahweh! The Lord Yahweh says this: For having squandered your money and let yourself be seen naked while whoring with your lovers and all the foul idols of your loathsome practices and for giving them your children’s blood — for all this, I shall assemble all the lovers to whom you have given pleasure, all the ones you liked and also all the ones you disliked; yes, I shall assemble them around you and strip you naked in front of them, and let them see you naked from head to foot. I shall pass on you the sentence that adulteresses and murderesses receive; I shall hand you over to their jealous fury; I shall hand you over to them; they will destroy your mound and pull down your high place; they will tear off your clothes, take away your jewels and leave you stark naked. Then they will call an assembly of citizens to deal with you, who will stone you to death and hack you to pieces with their swords, and burn down your premises and execute justice on you, while many other women look on; and I shall put an end to your whoring: no more paid lovers for you! Once my fury is exhausted with you, then my jealousy will leave you; I shall be calm and not angry any more. Since you never called to mind your early days and have done nothing but provoke me, now I in my turn shall bring your conduct down on your own head — declares the Lord Yahweh!</p>

<p>‘Have you not added this lewd behaviour to your other loathsome practices? So now all dealers in proverbs will apply this one to you: Like mother, like daughter. Yes; you are a true daughter of your mother, who hated her husband and her children; you are a true sister of your sisters, who hated their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite. Your elder sister is Samaria, who lives to the north of you with her daughters. Your younger sister is Sodom, who lives to the south of you with her daughters. You never failed to imitate their behaviour and copy their loathsome practices, and soon your behaviour was more corrupt than theirs was. As I live - declares the Lord Yahweh — your sister Sodom and her daughters never did what you and your daughters have done. The crime of your sister Sodom was pride, gluttony, calm complacency; such were hers and her daughters’ crimes. They never helped the poor and needy; they were proud, and engaged in loathsome practices before me, and so I swept them away as you have seen. And yet Samaria never committed half the crimes that you have.</p>

<p>‘You have done more loathsome things than they have. By all your loathsome practices you have made your sisters seem innocent, and now you bear the shame of which you have freed your sisters; since the sins which you have committed are more revolting than theirs, they are more upright than you are. So now, bear the disgrace and shame of having put your sisters in the right.</p>

<p>‘I shall restore their fortunes, I shall restore Sodom and her daughters, I shall restore Samaria and her daughters, and then I shall restore your fortune with theirs, so that you can bear your shame and disgrace for all you have done, and so console them. When your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, are restored to what they were, and Samaria and her daughters are restored to what they were, then you too and your daughters will be restored to what you were. Did you not gloat over your sister Sodom when you were so proud, before you were stripped naked? Like her, you are now the laughing-stock of the women of Edom, of all the women around, of the women of Philistia, who pour out their contempt on you. You have brought this on yourself, with your lewdness and your loathsome practices — declares the Lord Yahweh.</p>

<p>‘For the Lord Yahweh says this: I shall treat you as you have deserved for making light of an oath and breaking a covenant, but I shall remember my covenant with you when you were a girl and shall conclude a covenant with you that will last for ever. And you for your part will remember your behaviour and feel ashamed of it when you receive your elder and younger sisters and I make them your daughters, although this is not included in my covenant with you. I shall renew my covenant with you; and you will know that I am Yahweh, and so remember and feel ashamed and in your confusion be reduced to silence, when I forgive you for everything you have done — declares the Lord Yahweh’”.</p>

<h4 id="ch17">The allegory of the eagle (17:1–24)</h4>

<p>The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows, “Son of man, put a riddle, propound a parable to the House of Israel. Say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>A great eagle with great wings,</span><br />
		<span>long-pinioned,</span><br />
		<span>rich with many-coloured plumage,</span><br />
		<span>came to the Lebanon.</span><br />
		<span>He took the top of the cedar tree,</span><br />
		<span>he plucked off the top branch,</span><br />
		<span>he carried it off to the country of merchants</span><br />
		<span>and set it down in a city of shopkeepers.</span><br />
		<span>Next, he took one of the country’s seeds</span><br />
		<span>and put it in a fertile field;</span><br />
		<span>by the side of a generous stream,</span><br />
		<span>like a willow tree, he placed it.</span><br />
		<span>It grew and became a fruitful vine</span><br />
		<span>of modest size,</span><br />
		<span>grew up towards the eagle,</span><br />
		<span>its roots grew downwards.</span><br />
		<span>So it became a vine,</span><br />
		<span>branching out and sprouting new shoots.</span>
	</p>

	<p class="poem">
		<span>But there was another great eagle</span><br />
		<span>with great wings and thick plumage.</span><br />
		<span>And now the vine twisted its roots towards him</span><br />
		<span>and stretched its branches towards him,</span><br />
		<span>for him to water it</span><br />
		<span>away from the bed where it was planted.</span><br />
		<span>It was in a fertile field,</span><br />
		<span>by the side of a wide stream</span><br />
		<span>that the vine had been planted,</span><br />
		<span>to branch out and bear fruit</span><br />
		<span>and become a noble vine’.</span>
	</p>

	<p class="poem">
		<span>Say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this:</span><br />
		<span>Will it succeed?</span><br />
		<span>Will the eagle not tear out its roots</span><br />
		<span>and strip off its fruit,</span><br />
		<span>so that all the new leaves it puts out will wither,</span><br />
		<span>and no great strength is needed nor many people</span><br />

		<span>Will it not shrivel up when the east wind blows?</span><br />
		<span>It will wither in the bed where it was growing!’”.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows:</p>

<p>“Say to that tribe of rebels, ‘Do you not know what this means?’. Say this, “Look, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem; he carried away the king and the princes, and took them to his home in Babylon. He took a member of the royal family and made a treaty with him, forcing him to swear loyalty, having already deported the leading men of the country, so that the kingdom would remain modest and without ambitions, and would keep and honour his treaty. But the prince rebelled against him and sent envoys to Egypt to procure himself horses and a large number of troops. Will he succeed? Will a man who has done this go unpunished? Can he break a treaty and go unpunished? As I live, I swear it — declares the Lord Yahweh — in Babylon, in the country of the king who put him on the throne, whose oath he has disregarded and whose treaty he has broken, there he will die. Despite the pharaoh’s great army and hordes of men, he will not be able to save him by fighting, however many earthworks are raised, however many trenches dug to the loss of many lives. He has disregarded the oath by breaking the treaty to which he had pledged himself and, having done all this, will not go unpunished.</p>

<p>‘So, the Lord Yahweh says this: As I live, I swear it: my oath which he has disregarded, my treaty which he has broken, I shall make them both recoil on his own head. I shall throw my net over him, he will be caught in my mesh; I shall take him to Babylon and punish him there for being unfaithful to me. All the pick of all his troops will fall by the sword, and the survivors be scattered to all the winds. And you will know that I, Yahweh, have spoken.</p>

<p>‘The Lord Yahweh says this:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>From the top of the tall cedar tree,</span><br />
		<span>from the highest branch I shall take a shoot</span><br />
		<span>and plant it myself on a high and lofty mountain.</span><br />
		<span>I shall plant it on the highest mountain in Israel.</span><br />
		<span>It will put out branches and bear fruit</span><br />
		<span>and grow into a noble cedar tree.</span><br />
		<span>Every kind of bird will live beneath it,</span><br />
		<span>every kind of winged creature will rest in the shade of its branches.</span><br />
		<span>And all the trees of the countryside will know that I, Yahweh, am the one</span><br />
		<span>who lays the tall tree low and raises the low tree high,</span><br />
		<span>who makes the green tree wither and makes the withered bear fruit.</span><br />
		<span>I, Yahweh, have spoken, and I will do it’”.</span>

<p>The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows, “Why do you keep repeating this proverb in the land of Israel:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>The parents have eaten unripe grapes;</span><br />
		<span>and the children’s teeth are set on edge?</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“As I live — declares the Lord Yahweh — you will have no further cause to repeat this proverb in Israel. Look, all life belongs to me; the father’s life and the son’s life, both alike belong to me. The one who has sinned is the one to die.</p>

<p>“But if a man is upright, his actions law-abiding and upright, and he does not eat on the mountains or raise his eyes to the foul idols of the House of Israel, does not defile his neighbour’s wife or touch a woman during her periods, oppresses no one, returns the pledge on a debt, does not rob, gives his own food to the hungry, his clothes to those who lack clothing, does not lend for profit, does not charge interest, abstains from evil, gives honest judgement between one person and another, keeps my laws and sincerely respects my judgements — someöne like this is truly upright and will live — declares the Lord Yahweh.</p>

<p>“But if he has a son prone to violence and bloodshed, who commits one of these misdeeds — even though the father never has — a son who dares to eat on the mountains, who defiles his neighbour’s wife, who oppresses the poor and needy, robs, fails to return pledges, raises his eyes to foul idols, engages in loathsome practices, lends for profit, or charges interest, such a person will by no means live; having committed all these appalling crimes he will die, and his blood be on his own head.</p>

<p>“But if he in turn has a son who, in spite of seeing all the sins that his father has committed, does not imitate him, does not eat on the mountains or raise his eyes to the foul idols of the House of Israel, does not defile his neighbour’s wife, oppresses no one, takes no pledges, does not rob, gives his own food to the hungry, his clothes to those who lack clothing, abstains from evil, does not lend for profit or charge interest, respects my judgements and keeps my laws, he will not die for his father’s sins: he will most certainly live. But his father, because he was violent, robbed others and never did good among his people, will most certainly die in his guilt.</p>

<p>“Now, you say, ‘Why doesn’t the son bear his father’s guilt?’. If the son has been law-abiding and upright, has kept all my laws and followed them, most certainly he will live. The one who has sinned is the one who must die; a son is not to bear his father’s guilt, nor a father his son’s guilt. The upright will be credited with his uprightness, and the wicked with his wickedness.</p>

<p>“If the wicked, however, renounces all the sins he has committed, respects my laws and is law-abiding and upright, he will most certainly live; he will not die. None of the crimes he committed will be remembered against him from then on; he will most certainly live because of his upright actions. Would I take pleasure in the death of the wicked — declares the Lord Yahweh — and not prefer to see him renounce his wickedness and live?</p>

<p>“But if the upright abandons uprightness and does wrong by copying all the loathsome practices of the wicked, is he to live? All his upright actions will be forgotten from then on; for the infidelity of which he is guilty and the sin which he has committed, he will most certainly die.</p>

<p>“Now, you say, ‘What the Lord does is unjust’. Now listen, House of Israel: is what I do unjust? Is it not what you do that is unjust? When the upright abandons uprightness and does wrong and dies, he dies because of the wrong which he himself has done. Similarly, when the wicked abandons wickedness to become law-abiding and upright, he saves his own life. Having chosen to renounce all his previous crimes, he will most certainly live: he will not die. And yet the House of Israel says, ‘What the Lord does is unjust’. Is what I do unjust, House of Israel? Is it not what you do that is unjust? So in future, House of Israel, I shall judge each of you by what that person does — declares the Lord Yahweh. Repent, renounce all your crimes, avoid all occasions for guilt. Shake off all the crimes you have committed, and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit! Why die, House of Israel? I take no pleasure in the death of anyone — declares the Lord Yahweh — so repent and live!”.</p>

<h4 id="ch20">An account of Israel’s infidelities (20:1–44)</h4>

<p>In the seventh year, on the tenth day of the fifth month, some of the elders of Israel came to consult Yahweh and were sitting with me, when the word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows, “Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel. Say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Have you come to consult me? As I live, I will not be consulted by you — declares the Lord Yahweh’.</p>

<p>“Are you ready to judge them? Are you ready to judge them, son of man? Confront them with the loathsome practices of their ancestors. Say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: On the day when I chose Israel, when I pledged my word to the House of Jacob, I made myself known to them in Egypt; I pledged my word to them and said: I am Yahweh your God. That day I pledged them my word that I would bring them out of Egypt to a country which I had reconnoitred for them, a country flowing with milk and honey, and the loveliest of them all. And I said to them: Each of you must reject the horrors which attract you; do not pollute yourselves with the foul idols of Egypt; I am Yahweh your God. But they rebelled against me and would not listen to me. Not one of them rejected the horrors which attracted them; they did not give up the foul idols of Egypt. I then resolved to vent my fury on them, to sate my anger on them in Egypt. But respect for my own name kept me from letting it be profaned in the eyes of the nations among whom they were living, and before whom I had made myself known to them and promised to bring them out of Egypt. So I brought them out of Egypt and led them into the desert. I gave them my laws and taught them my judgements, in whose observance people find life. And I also gave them my Sabbaths as a sign between me and them, so that they might know that I, Yahweh, am the one who sanctifies them. The House of Israel, however, rebelled against me in the desert; they refused to keep my laws, they scorned my judgements, in whose observance people find life, and they grossly profaned my Sabbaths. I then resolved to vent my fury on them in the desert and destroy them. But respect for my own name kept me from letting it be profaned in the eyes of the nations, before whom I had brought them out. Even so, I pledged them my word in the desert that I would not lead them to the country which I had given them, a country flowing with milk and honey, and the loveliest of them all, since they had scorned my judgements, had refused to keep my laws and had profaned my Sabbaths, their hearts being attached to foul idols. In spite of this, I took pity on them; I refrained from destroying them and did not make an end of them in the desert.</p>

<p>‘I said to their children in the desert: Do not follow the laws of your ancestors, do not practise their judgements, do not defile yourselves with their foul idols. I am Yahweh your God. Keep my laws, respect my judgements and practise them. Keep my Sabbaths holy; let them be a sign between me and you, so that people may know that I am Yahweh your God. Their children, however, rebelled against me; they refused to keep my laws, they did not respect or practise my judgements, which must be practised by all who want to live; they profaned my Sabbaths. I then resolved to vent my fury on them, to sate my anger on them in the desert. But I restrained my hand; respect for my own name kept me from letting it be profaned in the eyes of the nations, before whom I had brought them out. Once again, however, I pledged them my word that I would scatter them throughout the nations and disperse them in foreign countries, because they had not followed my judgements but had rejected my laws and profaned my Sabbaths, their eyes being fastened on the foul idols of their ancestors. And for this reason I gave them laws that were not good and judgements by which they could never live; and I polluted them with their own offerings, making them sacrifice every first-born son in order to fill them with revulsion, so that they would know that I am Yahweh’.</p>

<p>“For this reason, son of man, speak to the House of Israel. Say to them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Here is another way by which your ancestors outraged me by their infidelity. Once I had brought them into the country which I had pledged my word to give them, they then saw all sorts of high hills, all kinds of leafy trees, and there they performed their sacrifices and made offerings that provoked my anger; there they set out their pleasing smell and poured their libations. I then said to them: What is this high place where you go? And they gave, and still give it, the name of Bamah’.</p>

<p>“So, say to the House of Israel, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: If you are polluting yourselves as your ancestors did by fornicating with their horrors — for by offering your gifts and by burning your children as sacrifices, you have been polluting yourselves with all your foul idols to this very day — shall I let myself be consulted by you, House of Israel? As I live — declares Lord Yahweh — I shall not let myself be consulted by you. And what you sometimes imagine will never be so, when you say: We shall be like the peoples, the tribes of foreign lands, worshipping wood and stone. As I live I swear it — declares the Lord Yahweh — I am the one who will reign over you, with a strong hand and outstretched arm, once my fury is sated. With a strong hand and outstretched arm, once my fury is sated, I shall bring you back from the peoples and gather you again from the countries throughout which you have been scattered. I shall lead you into the desert of the nations and there I shall judge you face to face. As I judged your ancestors in the desert of Egypt, so will I judge you — declares the Lord Yahweh. I shall make you pass under the crook, bring you to respect the covenant and rid you of the rebels who have revolted against me; I shall bring them out of the country where they are staying, but they will not enter the country of Israel, and you will know that I am Yahweh. House of Israel, Lord Yahweh says this: Go on, all of you, worship your foul idols, but later we shall see if you don’t listen to me! Then you will stop profaning my holy name with your offerings and your foul idols. For on my holy mountain, on the high mountain of Israel — declares the Lord Yahweh — is where the whole House of Israel, everyone in the country, will worship me. There I shall accept and there expect your presents, your choicest offering and all your consecrated gifts. I shall welcome you like a pleasing smell when I bring you back from the peoples and gather you from the countries throughout which you have been scattered, and through you I shall display my holiness for all the nations to see; and you will know that I am Yahweh, when I bring you back to the soil of Israel, to the country which I pledged my word to give to your ancestors. There you will remember your past behaviour and all the actions by which you have defiled yourselves, and you will loathe yourselves for all the wrongs which you have committed. And you will know that I am Yahweh, when I treat you as respect for my own name requires, and not as your wicked behaviour and corrupt actions deserve, House of Israel — declares the Lord Yahweh’”.</p>

<h4 id="ch21">The sword of Yahweh (21:1–22)</h4>

<p>The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows, “Son of man, turn to the right; utter your word towards the south, prophesy against the forest land of the Negeb. Say to the forest of Negeb, ‘Hear the word of Yahweh! The Lord Yahweh says this: Listen; I am about to kindle a fire in you which will burn up every green tree in you as well as every dry one; it will be an unquenchable blaze and every face will be scorched by it from the Negeb to the north. All humanity will see that it was I, Yahweh, who kindled it, and it will not be extinguished’”.</p>

<p>I said, “Lord Yahweh, they say of me, ‘He does nothing but speak in riddles!’”.</p>

<p>Then the word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows, “Son of man, turn towards Jerusalem, utter your word towards the sanctuary and prophesy against the land of Israel. Say to the land of Israel, ‘Yahweh says this: Now I am against you; I am about to unsheathe my sword and rid you of the upright and the wicked alike. Since I am going to rid you of upright and wicked alike, I shall unsheathe my sword against everyone alive, from the Negeb to the north, so that everyone alive will know that I, Yahweh, am the one who has unsheathed my sword; it will not go back again’.</p>

<p>“Son of man, groan as though your heart were breaking. Litter your bitter groans where they can see you. And if they say, ‘Why these groans?’, reply, ‘Because of the news which is about to come, all hearts will sink, all hands grow weak, all spirits grow faint and all knees turn to water. It is coming now, it is here! — declares Lord Yahweh’”.</p>

<p>The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows, “Son of man, prophesy. Say, ‘The Lord says this. Say:</p>

<h4>The king of Babylon at the crossroads (21:23–32)</h4>

<p>The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows, “Son of man, mark out two roads for the sword of the king of Babylon to come along, making both of them begin from the same country. Then put up a signpost, put it where the road leaves for the city, trace the route which the sword should take for Rabbah-of-the-Ammonites, and for Judah, to the fortress of Jerusalem. For the king of Babylon has halted at the fork where these two roads diverge, to take the omens. He has shaken the arrows, questioned the household gods, inspected the liver. The lot marked “Jerusalem” is in his right hand: there to set up battering-rams, give the word for slaughter, raise the war cry, level battering-rams against the gates, cast up earthworks, build entrenchments. The inhabitants will believe that these omens are idle, for they have received sworn guarantees, but he will bring their guilt to mind and capture them. And so the Lord Yahweh says this, ‘Since you have brought your guilt to mind by parading your misdeeds and flaunting your sins in everything you do: because you have drawn attention to yourselves, you will be captured. As for you, impious and wicked prince of Israel, whose doom is approaching to put an end to your crimes, the Lord Yahweh says this: They will take away your diadem and remove your crown. Everything will be changed; the low will be raised and the high brought low! Ruin, ruin, I shall bring such ruin as never was before, until the rightful ruler comes, on whom I shall bestow it’.</p>

<h4>The punishment of Ammon (21:33–37)</h4>

<p>“Son of man, prophesy and say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: In reply to the Ammonites and their jeers, say: The sword, the sword is drawn for slaughter, polished to devour, to flash like lightning — while you have empty visions and consult lying omens — to cut the throats of the wicked, whose doom is approaching to put an end to their crimes. Put it back in the scabbard. The place where you were created, the land of your origin, will be where I judge you. I shall vent my fury on you, breathe the fire of my rage against you and hand you over to barbarous men whose trade is destruction. You will be fuel for the fire, your blood will flow through the country, you will leave no memory behind you; for I, Yahweh, have spoken!’”.</p>

<h4 id="ch22">The crimes of Jerusalem (22:1–31)</h4>

<p>The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows, “Son of man, are you ready to judge? Are you ready to judge the blood-stained city? Confront her with all her loathsome practices! Say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: City shedding blood inside yourself to hasten your doom, making foul idols on your soil to defile yourself, you have incurred guilt by the blood you have shed, you have defiled yourself with the foul idols you have made, you have shortened your days, you have come to the end of your years. This is why I have made you an object of scorn to the nations and a laughing-stock to every country. From far and near they will taunt you with your infamous disorders.</p>

<p>‘Look! In you the princes of Israel, one and all, have furthered their own interests at the cost of bloodshed; in you people have despised their fathers and mothers; in you they have ill-treated the settler; in you they have oppressed the widow and orphan. You have treated my sanctuary with contempt, you have profaned my Sabbaths. In you informers incite to bloodshed; in you people eat on the mountains and act licentiously; in you they have sexual intercourse with their fathers; in you they force themselves on women in their periods; in you one man engages in loathsome practices with his neighbour’s wife, another lewdly defiles his daughter-in-law, another violates his sister, his own father’s daughter. In you people take bribes for shedding blood; you lend for profit and charge interest, you profit from your fellow by extortion and have forgotten about me — declares the Lord Yahweh.</p>

<p>‘Now I shall clap my hands at your acts of banditry and the blood that flows in you. Will your heart be able to resist, will your hands be steady, the day when I call you to account? I, Yahweh, have spoken and shall act. I shall scatter you among the nations and disperse you in foreign countries, and so put an end to the filthiness now inside you; through your own fault, you will be profaned in the eyes of the nations, and you will know that I am Yahweh!’”.</p>

<p>The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows, “Son of man, for me, the House of Israel has become dross: copper, tin, iron, lead, all mixed up together in the melting-pot; they are dross. And so, Lord Yahweh says this, ‘Since you have all become dross, right! I shall collect you inside Jerusalem. As silver, copper, iron, lead and tin are collected in the melting-pot, and the fire is blown underneath to melt them down, so I shall collect you in my furious anger and have you melted down; I shall collect you and blow up the fire of my rage for you and have you melted down inside the city. As silver is melted in the melting-pot, so you will be melted down inside the city, and you will know that I, Yahweh, have vented my fury on you’”.</p>

<p>The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows, “Son of man, say to her, ‘You are a land that has not received rain or shower on the day of anger. In you, the princes are like a roaring lion tearing its prey. They have eaten the people, seized wealth and jewels and widowed many inside her. Her priests have violated my law and desecrated my sanctuary; they have made no distinction between sacred and profane, they have not taught people the difference between clean and unclean; they have turned their eyes away from my Sabbaths and I have been dishonoured by them. In her the leaders are wolves tearing their prey, shedding blood and killing people to steal their possessions. Her prophets have plastered these things over with their empty visions and lying prophecies, saying: Yahweh says this, although Yahweh has not spoken. The people of the country have taken to extortion and banditry; they have oppressed the poor and needy and ill-treated the settler in a way that is unjustifiable. I have been looking for someöne among them to build a barricade and oppose me in the breach, to defend the country and prevent me from destroying it; but I have found no one. Hence I have vented my fury on them; I have put an end to them in the fire of my rage. I have made their conduct recoil on their own heads — declares the Lord Yahweh’”.</p>

<h4 id="ch23">An allegorical history of Jerusalem and Samaria (23:1–49)</h4>

<p>The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows, “Son of man, there were once two women, daughters of the same mother. They played the whore in Egypt; they played the whore when they were still girls. There their nipples were handled, there their virgin breasts were first fondled. Their names were: Oholah the elder, Oholibah her sister. They belonged to me and bore sons and daughters. As regards their names, Samaria is Oholah, Jerusalem Oholibah. Now Oholah played the whore, although she belonged to me; she lusted after her lovers, her neighbours the Assyrians, dressed in purple, governors and magistrates, all of them young and desirable, and skilful horsemen. She played the whore with all of them, the pick of Assyria, and defiled herself with all the foul idols of all those with whom she was in love, nor did she give up the whoring begun in Egypt, where men had slept with her from her girlhood, fondling her virgin breasts, debauching her over and over again.</p>

<p>“That is why I have handed her over to her lovers, to the Assyrians with whom she was in love. They stripped her naked, seized her sons and daughters and put her to the sword. She became notorious among women for the justice done on her.</p>

<p>“Her sister Oholibah saw all this, but she was even more depraved, and her whorings were worse than her sister’s. She fell in love with her neighbours the Assyrians, governors and magistrates, dressed in sumptuous clothes, skilful horsemen, all young and desirable. Then I saw that she had defiled herself, that both sisters were equally bad. She began whoring worse than ever; no sooner had she seen wall-carvings of men, pictures of Chaldaeans coloured vermilion, men with sashes around their waists and elaborate turbans on their heads, all so lordly of bearing, depicting the Babylonians, natives of Chaldaea, than she fell in love with them at first sight and sent messengers to them in Chaldaea. The Babylonians came to her, shared her love-bed and defiled her with their whoring. Once defiled by them, she withdrew her affection from them. Thus she flaunted her whoring, exposing her body, until I withdrew my affection from her as I had withdrawn it from her sister. But she began whoring worse than ever, remembering her girlhood, when she had played the whore in Egypt, when she had been in love with their profligates, big-membered as donkeys, ejaculating as violently as stallions.</p>

<p>“You were hankering for the debauchery of your girlhood, when they used to handle your nipples in Egypt and fondle your young breasts. And so, Oholibah, Lord Yahweh says this, ‘I shall set all your lovers against you, from whom you have withdrawn your affection, and bring them to assault you from all directions: the Babylonians and all the Chaldaeans, the men of Pekod and Shoa and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them, young and desirable, all governors and magistrates, all famous lords and skilful horsemen. From the north, they will advance on you with chariots and wagons and an international army and beset you with shield, buckler and helmet on all sides. I shall charge them to pass sentence on you and they will pass sentence on you as they think fit. I shall direct my jealousy against you; they will treat you with fury; they will cut off your nose and ears, and what is left of your family will fall by the sword; they will seize your sons and daughters, and what is left will be burnt. They will strip off your garments and rob you of your jewels. I shall put an end to your debauchery and to the whorings you began in Egypt; you will not look to the Egyptians any more, you will never think of them again. For the Lord Yahweh says this: Now, I shall hand you over to those you hate, to those for whom you no longer feel affection. They will treat you with hatred, they will rob you of the entire fruit of your labours and leave you stark naked. And thus your shameful whorings will be exposed, your debauchery and your whorings. This will happen to you because you have played the whore with the nations and have defiled yourself with their foul idols. Since you have copied your sister’s behaviour, I shall put her cup in your hand’. The Lord Yahweh says this:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>You will drink your sister’s cup,</span><br />
		<span>a cup both deep and wide,</span><br />
		<span>leading to laughter and mockery,</span><br />
		<span>so ample the draught it holds.</span><br />
		<span>You will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow.</span><br />
		<span>Cup of affliction and devastation,</span><br />
		<span>the cup of your sister Samaria,</span><br />
		<span>you will drink it, you will drain it;</span><br />
		<span>then you will break it in pieces</span><br />
		<span>and lacerate your own breasts.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote> 

<p>For I have spoken — declared the Lord Yahweh.</p>

<p>‘And so, the Lord Yahweh says this: Since you have forgotten me and have turned your back on me, you too will have to bear the weight of your debauchery and whorings’”. And Yahweh said to me, “Son of man, are you ready to judge Oholah and Oholibah and charge them with their loathsome practices? They have been adulteresses, their hands are dripping with blood, they have committed adultery with their foul idols. As for the children they had borne me, they have offered them as burnt sacrifices to feed them. And here is something else they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary today and have profaned my Sabbaths. The same day as sacrificing their children to their idols, they have been to my sanctuary and profaned it. Yes, this is what they have done in my own house.</p>

<p>“Worse still, they summoned men from far away, invited by messenger, and they came. For them you bathed, you painted your eyes, put on your jewels and sat on a sumptuous bed, by which a table was laid out. On this you had put my incense and my oil. The noise of the carefree company resounded, made by the crowd of men brought in from the desert; they put bracelets on the women’s arms and magnificent crowns on their heads. I thought, ‘That woman, worn out with adultery! Are they going to fornicate with her too?’. Yet they visit her like any common prostitute, just as they visited those profligate women Oholah and Oholibah. All the same, there are upright men who will judge them as adulteresses and murderesses are judged, since they are adulteresses and their hands are dripping with blood’.</p>

<p>“The Lord Yahweh says this, ‘Summon an assembly to deal with them, and hand them over to terror and pillage; let the assembly stone them and dispatch them with their swords; let their sons and daughters be slaughtered and their houses set on fire. This is how I shall purge the country of debauchery, so that all women will be taught the lesson never to ape your debauchery again. Your debauchery will recoil on yourselves, and you will bear the weight of the sins committed with your foul idols and you will know that I am the Lord Yahweh’”.</p>

<h4 id="ch24">Announcement of the siege of Jerusalem (24:1–14)</h4>

<p>In the ninth year, on the tenth day of the tenth month, the word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows, “Son of man, write down today’s date, yes, today’s, for this very day the king of Babylon began his attack on Jerusalem. So pronounce a parable for this tribe of rebels. Say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Put the pot on the fire;</span><br />
		<span>put it on; pour the water in!</span><br />
		<span>Now put the cuts of meat all in together,</span><br />
		<span>all the best cuts, leg and shoulder.</span><br />
		<span>Fill it with the best bones.</span><br />
		<span>Take the best of the flock,</span><br />
		<span>then heap wood underneath;</span><br />
		<span>boil it thoroughly</span><br />
		<span>until even the bones are cooked.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>‘For the Lord Yahweh says this:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Disaster is in store for the bloody city,</span><br />
		<span>for that rusty cooking pot</span><br />
		<span>whose rust will not come off!</span><br />
		<span>Empty it, bit by bit,</span><br />
		<span>not bothering to draw lots;</span><br />
		<span>for she is still full of bloodshed,</span><br />
		<span>she has put blood on the naked rock;</span><br />
		<span>she did not pour it on the ground</span><br />
		<span>so as to cover it with dust.</span><br />
		<span>To make anger rise, to exact vengeance,</span><br />
		<span>I have put her blood on the naked rock,</span><br />
		<span>so that it should not be covered:</span>
	</p>

<p>‘So, the Lord Yahweh says this:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Disaster is in store for the bloody city!</span><br />
		<span>I too plan to build a great fire.</span><br />
		<span>Heap on the wood, light it,</span><br />
		<span>cook the meat, prepare the seasoning</span><br />
		<span>let the bones burn!</span><br />
		<span>Put the empty pot on the coals</span><br />
		<span>to make it hot,</span><br />
		<span>until the bronze glows,</span><br />

		<span>and the rust is burnt away!</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>‘But all that rust would not come off in the fire. Your filth is infamous. Since I have tried to purge you and you would not let yourself be purged of your filth, so now you will never be purged of your filth until I have sated my anger on you. I, Yahweh, have spoken; this will happen; I shall act and not relent; I shall show no pity, no compassion. You will be judged as your conduct and actions deserve — declares the Lord Yahweh’.</p>

<h4>Ordeals for the prophet (24:15–27)</h4>

<p>The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows, “Son of man, at a blow I am about to deprive you of the delight of your eyes. But you are not to lament, not to weep, not to let your tears run down. Groan in silence, do not go into mourning for the dead, knot your turban around your head, put your sandals on your feet, do not cover your beard, do not eat the usual food”. I told this to the people in the morning, and my wife died in the evening, and the next morning I did as I had been ordered.</p>

<p>The people then said to me, “Will you not explain what meaning these actions have for us?”.</p>

<p>I replied, “The word of Yahweh has been addressed to me as follows, ‘Say to the House of Israel, the Lord Yahweh says this: I am about to profane my sanctuary, the pride of your strength, the delight of your eyes, the joy of your hearts. Your sons and daughters whom you have left behind will fall by the sword. Then you will do as I have done: you will not cover your beards or eat the usual food; you will keep your turbans on your heads and your sandals on your feet; you will not lament or weep but will waste away for your crimes, groaning among yourselves. Thus Ezekiel is a sign for you. You will do exactly what he has done. And when this happens, you will know that I am Lord Yahweh!’.</p>

<p>“And, son of man, the day that I deprive them of their strength, their crowning joy, the delight of their eyes, the joy of their hearts, their sons and daughters, that day a survivor will bring you the news. That day your mouth will be opened to speak to the survivor; you will speak and no longer be dumb; you will be a sign for them, and they will know that I am Yahweh”.</p>

<h2 id="ii">II: Prophecies Against the Nations (25:1–32:32)</h2>

<h4>Against the Ammonites (25:1–7)</h4>

<p>The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows, “Son of man, turn towards the Ammonites and prophesy against them. Say to the Ammonites, ‘Hear the word of the Lord Yahweh. The Lord Yahweh says this:</p> 

<p>‘Since you gloated over my sanctuary when it was profaned, and over the land of Israel when it was ravaged, and over the House of Judah when it went into exile, I shall let the sons of the East take possession of you; they will pitch their camps inside you, they will make their home in you. They will be the ones to eat your produce and drink your milk. I shall turn Rabbah into a camel yard and the towns of Ammon into sheepfolds. And so you will know that I am Yahweh.</p>

<p>‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Since you have clapped your hands and danced for joy, full of malicious delight at Israel’s fate, my hand will be against you for this; I shall hand you over to be looted by the peoples, obliterate you as a nation and wipe you out as a country. I shall reduce you to nothing, and you will know that I am Yahweh.</p>

<h4>Against Moab (25:8–11)</h4>

<p>‘The Lord Yahweh says this:</p>

<p>‘Since Moab and Seir have said: Look at the House of Judah; it is no	different from any other nation; very well, I shall expose Moab’s heights; its cities will no longer be cities throughout the land — the jewels of the country, Beth-Jeshimoth, Baal-Meon and Kiriathaim. I shall let the sons of the East and the Ammonites take possession of them, so that they will no longer be remembered by the nations. I shall bring Moab to justice, and they will know that I am Yahweh.</p>

<h4>Against Edom (25:12–14)</h4>

<p>‘The Lord Yahweh says this:</p>

<p>‘Since Edom has taken revenge on the House of Judah and committed great crimes in doing so, very well, the Lord Yahweh says this: My hand will be against Edom and denude it of human and animal. I shall lay it waste, from Teman as far as Dedan they will be put to the sword. I shall take vengeance on Edom by means of my people Israel. They will treat Edom as my anger and fury dictate, and they will know this is my vengeance — declares the Lord Yahweh.</p>

<h4>Against the Philistines (25:15–17)</h4>

<p>‘The Lord Yahweh says this,</p>

<p>‘Since the Philistines have acted in revenge and, motivated by malice, have taken revenge, doing their best to destroy because of their long-standing hatred, very well, the Lord Yahweh says this: My hand will be against the Philistines; I shall exterminate the Cherethites and destroy the rest of the coastal peoples. I shall perform frightful acts of vengeance and inflict furious punishments on them; and they will know that I am Yahweh, when I exact my vengeance on them’”.</p>

<h4 id="ch26">Against Tyre (26:1–21)</h4>

<p>In the eleventh year, on the first of the month, the word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows,</p>

<p>“Son of man, since Tyre has said of Jerusalem:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
	<span>‘Aha! She is shattered, the Gateway to the Nations;</span><br />
	<span>she now gives way to me.</span><br />
	<span>Her riches are ruined!’.</span><br />
	<span>Very well, the Lord Yahweh says this,</span><br />
	<span>‘Now, Tyre, I am against you,</span><br />
	<span>I shall raise many nations against you</span><br />
	<span>as the sea raises its waves.</span><br />
	<span>They will destroy the walls of Tyre,</span><br />
	<span>they will demolish her towers;</span><br />
	<span>I shall sweep the dust of her away</span><br />
	<span>and reduce her to a naked rock.</span><br />
	<span>She will be a drying-ground out to sea for fishing-nets.</span><br />
	<span>For I have spoken — declares Lord Yahweh.</span><br />
	<span>She will be the prey of the nations.</span><br />
	<span>As for her daughters on the mainland,</span><br />
	<span>these will be put to the sword,</span><br />
	<span>and they will know that I am Yahweh’.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“For the Lord Yahweh says this, ‘From the north, I shall bring Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, king of kings, down on Tyre with horses, chariots, cavalry and an enormous army.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
	<span>He will put your daughters</span><br />

	<span>His horses are so many that their dust will hide you.</span><br />
	<span>The noise of his horsemen and his chariot-wheels</span><br />
	<span>will make your walls tremble as he enters your gates</span><br />
	<span>as though storming into a city through the breach.</span><br />
	<span>With his horses’ hoofs he will trample through all your streets;</span><br />
	<span>he will put your people to the sword,</span><br />
	<span>and throw your massive pillars to the ground.</span><br />
	<span>Your wealth will be seized, your merchandise looted,</span><br />
	<span>your walls razed, your luxurious houses shattered,</span><br />
	<span>your stones, your timbers, your very dust, thrown into the sea.</span><br />
	<span>I shall put an end to the sound of your songs;</span><br />
	<span>the sound of your harps will not be heard again.</span><br />
	<span>I shall reduce you to a naked rock,</span><br />
	<span>and make you into a drying-ground for fishing-nets,</span><br />

<h4>Lament over Tyre (26:15–21)</h4>

<p>“The Lord Yahweh says this to Tyre, ‘Will not the islands quake at the sound of your fall, while the wounded groan and the slaughter takes place inside you? All the princes of the sea will leave their thrones, lay aside their cloaks, take off their embroidered robes. Dressed in terror they will sit on the ground trembling incessantly, stunned at your fate.</p>

<p>‘They will raise the lament for you as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
	<span>You are destroyed then, vanished from the seas,</span><br />
	<span>famous city, former sea-power,</span><br />
	<span>who with her citizens,</span><br />
	<span>used to spread terror</span><br />
	<span>all over the mainland!</span><br />
	<span>Now the islands are trembling</span><br />
	<span>on the day of your fall;</span><br />
	<span>the islands of the sea are terrified by your end.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>‘For the Lord Yahweh says this:</p>

<p>‘When I make you a ruined city like other deserted cities, when I raise the deep against you and the ocean covers you, when I fling you down with those who go down into the abyss, with the people of long ago, and put  you deep in the underworld, in the ruins of long ago with those who sink into oblivion, so that you can never come back or be restored to the land of the living, I will make you an object of terror; you will not exist. People will look for you but never find you again — declares the Lord Yahweh!’”.</p>

<h4 id="ch27">Second lament over the fall of Tyre (27:1–36)</h4>

<p>The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows, “Son of man, raise the lament for Tyre. Say to Tyre, ‘City enthroned at the gateway of the sea, agent between the peoples and the many islands, Lord Yahweh says this:</p>

<p>‘Every sea-going ship and crew frequented you to guarantee your trade. Men from Persia, Lud and Put served as warriors in your army; hanging up shield and helmet in you, they displayed your splendour. The sons of Arvad with their army manned your walls all around, while the Gammadians manned your towers; hanging their shields all around your walls, they completed your beauty. Tarshish traded with you because of your abundant resources and exchanged your merchandise for silver, iron, tin and lead. Javan, Tubal and Meshech traded with you. For your merchandise they traded slaves and bronze artefacts. The people of Beth-Togarmah traded your horses, chargers, mules. The people of Dedan traded with you; many islands were your customers and paid you in ivory tusks and ebony. Edom traded with you for the sake of your many manufactured goods, exchanging garnets, purple, embroideries, fine linen, coral and rubies for your goods. Judah and the land of Israel also traded with you, bringing corn from Minnith, <i>pannag</i>, honey, oil and balm. Damascus traded with you, for quantities of your manufactured goods and other goods of all kinds, furnishing you with wine from Helbon and wool from Zahar. Dan and Javan, from Uzal onwards, supplied you with wrought iron, cassia and reeds in exchange for your goods. Dedan traded with you in saddle-cloths. Arabia and all the sheikhs of Kedar were your customers; they paid in lambs, rams and he-goats. The merchants of Sheba and Raamah traded with you; they supplied you with the finest spices, precious stones and gold for your merchandise. Haran, Canneh and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur and Chilmad traded with you.

No human foot will pass through it, no animal foot will pass through it. For forty years it will remain uninhabited. I shall make Egypt the most desolate of countries; for forty years its cities will be the most desolate of wasted cities. And I shall scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the countries. The Lord Yahweh, however, says this: After forty years have passed, I shall gather the Egyptians back from the nations where they were dispersed. I shall bring the Egyptian captives back and reïnstall them in the land of Pathros, in the country of their origin. There they will constitute a modest kingdom. Egypt will be the most modest of kingdoms and no longer dominate other nations; for I shall reduce it, so that it will not rule other nations ever again. It will no longer be anything for the House of Israel to trust in, but will be a reminder of the guilt which lay in turning to it for help. And they will know that I am Lord Yahweh’”.</p>

<p>In the twenty-seventh year, on the first day of the first month, the word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows:</p>

<p>“Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has taken his army in a great expedition against Tyre. Their heads have all gone bald, their shoulders are all chafed, but even so he has derived no profit, either for himself or for his army, from the expedition mounted against Tyre. Since this is so, the Lord Yahweh says this, ‘Look, I shall hand Egypt over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. He will carry off its riches, loot it, put it to the sack; that will be the wages for his army. As wages for the trouble he has taken, I am giving him Egypt instead (for they have been working for me) — declares the Lord Yahweh.</p>

<p>‘That day, I shall raise up a new stock for the House of Israel and allow you to open your mouth among them. And they will know that I am Yahweh’”.</p>

<h4 id="ch30">Against Egypt: the day of Yahweh (30:1–26)</h4>

<p>The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows: “Son of man, prophesy and say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Howl: Disaster day! For the day is near, the day of Yahweh is near; it will be a day dark with cloud, a time of doom for the nations.</p>

<p>‘The sword will come on Egypt, and anguish on the country of Cush when the slaughtered fall in Egypt, when her riches are carried away and her foundations are destroyed. Cush, Put and Lud, all Arabia, Cub and the children of the country of the covenant will fall by the sword with them.</p>

<p>‘Yahweh says this:</p>

<p>‘The supports of Egypt will fall; the pride of her strength will crumble; they will fall by the sword from Migdol to Syene — declares the Lord Yahweh.</p>

<p>‘They will be the most desolate of desolate countries, and its cities the most ruined of cities. And they will know that I am Yahweh when I set fire to Egypt and all its supports are shattered.</p>

<p>‘That day, I shall send messengers by ship to terrify the carefree Cushites, and anguish will overtake them on the day of Egypt — it is coming now! The Lord Yahweh says this: I shall destroy the huge population of Egypt at the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. He and his people, the most barbarous of nations, will be brought to ravage the country. They will draw the sword against Egypt and fill the country with corpses. I shall dry up the courses of the Nile and sell the country to the wicked. I shall lay the whole country waste and everything in it, at the hand of foreigners. I, Yahweh, have spoken.</p>

<p>‘The Lord Yahweh says this: I shall destroy the foul idols and take the false gods away from Noph. Egypt will be left without a ruler. I shall spread fear through Egypt. I shall lay Pathros waste, set Zoan on fire, inflict my punishments on No. I shall vent my fury on Sin, the bastion of Egypt; I shall wipe out the throngs of No. I shall set fire to Egypt; Sin will be seized with convulsions; a breach will be opened at No and the waters flood out. The young men of On and Pi-Beseth will fall by the sword and the cities themselves go into captivity. At Tahpanhes day will turn to darkness when I shatter the sceptres of Egypt there, when the pride of her strength ceases. A cloud will cover Egypt itself, and its daughters will go into captivity. Such will be the punishments I inflict on Egypt. And they will know that I am Yahweh’”.</p>

<p>In the eleventh year, on the seventh day of the first month, the word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows, “Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; you can see that no one has dressed his wound by applying remedies to it, by bandaging it and by dressing it, to make it strong enough to wield the sword. This being so, the Lord Yahweh says this, ‘Look, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt; I shall break his arms, the sound one and the broken one, and make the sword drop from his hand. I shall scatter Egypt among the nations and disperse it among the countries. I shall strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and put my sword in his hand. I shall break Pharaoh’s arms and, confronted with his enemy, he will groan like a dying man. I shall strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh will fall. And they will know that I am Yahweh, when I put my sword into the hands of the king of Babylon and he wields it against Egypt. I shall scatter Egypt among the nations and disperse it among the countries; and they will know that I am Yahweh’”.</p>

<h4 id="ch31">The cedar tree (31:1–18)</h4>

<p>In the eleventh year, on the first day of the third month, the word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows, “Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and his throng of subjects:</p> 

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>‘What can compare with you for greatness?</span><br />
		<span>I know: a cedar tree in the Lebanon</span><br />
		<span>with noble branches, dense foliage, lofty height.</span><br />
		<span>Its top pierces the clouds.</span><br />
		<span>The waters have made it grow, the deep has made it tall,</span><br />
		<span>pouring its rivers around the place where it is planted,</span><br />
		<span>sending rivulets to all the wild trees.</span><br />
		<span>This is why its height was greater than that of other wild trees,</span><br />
		<span>its branches increased in number, its boughs stretched wide,</span><br />
		<span>because of the plentiful waters making it grow.</span><br />
		<span>All the birds of heaven nested in its branches;</span><br />
		<span>under its boughs all wild animals dropped their young;</span><br />
		<span>in its shade sat many, many people.</span><br />
		<span>It was beautiful in its size, in the span of its boughs;</span><br />
		<span>for its roots were in plentiful waters.</span><br />
		<span>There was no cedar like it in the garden of God,</span><br />
		<span>no cypress had branches such as these,</span><br />
		<span>no plane tree could match its boughs,</span><br />
		<span>no tree in the garden of God could rival its beauty.</span><br />
		<span>I had made it so lovely with its many branches</span><br />
		<span>that it was the envy of every tree in Eden, in the garden of God.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<p>‘Very well, the Lord Yahweh says this:</p> 

<p>‘Since it has raised itself to its full height, has lifted its top into the clouds, and has grown arrogant about its height, I have handed it over to the prince of the nations, for him to treat as its wickedness deserves; I have rejected it. Foreigners, the most barbarous of nations, have cut it down and deserted it. On the mountains, in all the valleys, lie its branches; its broken boughs are in every ravine throughout the country; everybody in the country has fled its shade and deserted it. On its wreckage perch all the birds of heaven; all the wild animals have advanced on its branches.</p>

<p>‘So in future let no tree rear its height beside the waters, none push its top into the clouds, no watered tree stretch its height towards them. For all of them are doomed to death, to the depths of the underworld, with the common run of humanity, with those who sink into oblivion.</p>

<p>‘The Lord Yahweh says this: The day it went down to Sheol, I imposed mourning, I closed the deep over it. I stopped its rivers and the plentiful waters dried up; I made Lebanon dark because of it, and all the wild trees wilted because of it. With the noise when it fell I made the nations quake, as I hurled it down to Sheol, with those who sink into oblivion. In the depths of the underworld all the trees of Eden took comfort, the pick of the loveliest trees of the Lebanon, all irrigated by the waters. And its offspring among the nations, once living in its shade, went down to Sheol with it, to those who have been slaughtered by the sword.</p>

<p>‘Which of the trees of Eden compares with you for glory and greatness? Yet you have been hurled down with the trees of Eden, to the depths of the underworld, among the uncircumcised, and there you lie with those who have been slaughtered by the sword. So much for Pharaoh and all his throng — declares the LordYahweh’”.</p>

<h4 id="ch32">The crocodile (32:1–16)</h4>

<p>In the twelfth year, on the first day of the twelfth month, the word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows, “Son of man, raise a lament for Pharaoh king of Egypt. Say to him:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>‘Young lion of nations, you are destroyed!</span><br />
		<span>Once you were like a crocodile in the lagoons;</span><br />

		<span>you churned up the water with your trampling</span><br />
		<span>and fouled their streams.</span>
	</p>

<p>‘The Lord Yahweh says this:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>I shall throw my net over you in a great concourse of nations;</span><br />
		<span>and they will trawl you up in my net.</span><br />

		<span>I shall throw you out into the wilds</span><br />
		<span>and make all the birds of heaven settle on you,</span><br />
		<span>and glut all the beasts of the earth with you.</span><br />
		<span>I shall strew your flesh on your mountains</span><br />

<p>‘I shall grieve the heart of many peoples when I bring about your destruction among the nations, in countries unknown to you. I shall stun many peoples with shock at your fate; their kings will tremble with horror at your fate, when I brandish my sword before their eyes. The day you fall, each will tremble in terror for his life. For the Lord Yahweh says this: The sword of the king of Babylon will overtake you. I shall make your throngs of subjects fall at the swords of my warriors. They are the most barbarous of nations. They will annihilate the pride of Egypt, and all its throngs will be destroyed. I shall also destroy all its cattle beside the plentiful waters. No human foot will churn them, no animal foot will churn them up again; then I shall let their waters settle and make their rivers glide like oil — declares the Lord Yahweh.</p>

<p>‘When I reduce Egypt to a ruin and the country is stripped of its contents, when I strike all those who live there, they will know that I am Yahweh.</p>

<p>‘Such is the lament which the daughters of the nations will raise. They will raise it over Egypt and all its throng. This is the lament they will raise — declares the Lord Yahweh’”.</p>

<h4>Pharaoh goes down to Sheol (32:17–32)</h4>

<p>In the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the first month, the word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows, “Son of man, lament over the throng of Egypt, for down she must go with the daughters of majestic nations to the depths of the underworld with those who sink into oblivion.</p>

<p>“Whom do you surpass in beauty? Down with you, make your bed with the uncircumcised, with those who have been slaughtered by the sword. (The sword has been given, it has been drawn.) She and all her throngs have fallen. From the depths of Sheol, the mightiest heroes, her allies, will say to her, ‘They have come down, they have lain down, uncircumcised, slaughtered by the sword’.</p>

<p>“Assyria is there and all her hordes, with their graves all around her; all of them slaughtered, fallen by the sword; their graves have been made in the deepest part of the abyss, and her hordes, with their graves all around her; all of them slaughtered, killed by the sword, who once spread terror through the world of the living.</p>

<p>“Elan is there and all her throng around her grave, all of them slaughtered, fallen by the sword; they have gone down uncircumcised to the depths of the underworld, who once spread terror throughout the world of the living. They have borne their shame with those who sink into oblivion. Among the slaughtered, they have put a bed for her, among her throng with their tombs around her, all of them uncircumcised, slaughtered by the sword for having spread terror throughout the world of the living. They have borne their shame with those who sink into oblivion. They have been put among the slaughtered.</p>

<p>“Meshech, Tubal are there and all her throng, with their graves around her, all of them uncircumcised, slaughtered by the sword for having spread terror through the world of the living. They do not lie with the heroes who fell long ago, those who went down to Sheol fully armed, who had their swords laid under their heads and their shields put under their bones, since the heroes inspired the world of the living with terror. But you will be broken with the uncircumcised and lie with those slaughtered by the sword.</p>

<p>“Edom is there, her kings and all her princes who, despite their valour, have been laid with those slaughtered by the sword. They lie with the uncircumcised, with those who sink into oblivion.</p>

<p>“All the princes of the north and all the Sidonians are there, who have gone down with the slaughtered, because of the terror which their power inspired. Ashamed, uncircumcised, they lie among those slaughtered by the sword and bear their shame with those who sink into oblivion.</p>

<p>“Pharaoh will see them and take comfort at the sight of all this throng slaughtered by the sword — Pharaoh and all his throng — declares the Lord Yahweh. For having spread terror through the world of the living, he will be laid with the uncircumcised, with those slaughtered by the sword, Pharaoh and all his throng — declares the Lord Yahweh”.</p>

<h2 id="iii">III: During and After the Siege of Jerusalem (33:1–39:29)</h2>

<h4>The prophet as watchman (33:1–9)</h4>

<p>The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows, “Son of man, speak to the people of your country. Say to them, ‘When I send the sword against the people of that country, take one of their number and post him as a watchman; if he sees the sword coming against the country, he must sound his horn to warn the people. If someöne hears the sound of the horn but pays no attention and the sword overtakes him and destroys him, he will have been responsible for his own death. He has heard the sound of the horn and paid no attention; his death will be his own responsibility. But the life of someöne who pays attention will be secure.</p>

<p>‘If, however, the watchman has seen the sword coming but has not blown his horn, and so the people are not alerted and the sword overtakes them and destroys a single one of them, that person will indeed die for his guilt, but I shall hold the watchman responsible for his death’.</p>

<p>“Son of man I have appointed you as watchman for the House of Israel. When you hear a word from my mouth, warn them from me. If I say to someöne wicked, ‘Evil-doer, you are to die’, and you do not speak to warn the wicked person to renounce such ways, the wicked person will die for this guilt, but I shall hold you responsible for the death. If, however, you do warn someöne wicked to renounce such ways and repent, and that person does not repent, then the culprit will die for this guilt, but you yourself will have saved your life.</p>

<h4>Conversion and perversity (33:10–20)</h4>

<p>“Son of man, say to the House of Israel, ‘You are continually saying: Our crimes and sins weigh heavily on us; we are wasting away because of them. How are we to go on living?’. Say to them, ‘As I live — declares the Lord Yahweh — I do not take pleasure in the death of the wicked but in the conversion of the wicked who changes his ways and saves his life. Repent, turn back from your evil ways. Why die, House of Israel?’.</p>

<p>“Son of man, say to the members of your nation, ‘The uprightness of an upright person will not save him once he takes to wrong-doing; the wickedness of a wicked person will not ruin him once he renounces his wickedness. No one upright will be able to live on the strength of uprightness, having once taken to sinning. If I say to someöne upright: You are to live, and then, trusting in this uprightness, he does wrong, none of the uprightness will be remembered; because of the wrong-doing, he will die. If, however, I say to someöne wicked: You are to die, and he turns back from sin and does what is lawful and upright, if he returns pledges, restores what he has stolen, keeps the laws that give life and no longer does wrong, he will live and will not die. None of his previous sins will be remembered against him; having done what is lawful and upright, he will live.</p>

<p>‘But the members of your nation say: What the Lord does is unjust. But it is what you do that is unjust. When an upright person gives up being upright and does wrong, he dies for it. And when a wicked person gives up being wicked and does what is lawful and upright, because of this he lives. But you say: What the Lord does is unjust! I shall judge each of you by what you do, House of Israel’.</p>

<h4>The taking of the city (33:21–22)</h4>

<p>In the twelfth year of our captivity, on the fifth day of the tenth month, a fugitive arrived from Jerusalem and said to me, “The city has been taken”. Now the hand of the Lord had been on me the evening before the fugitive arrived; he had opened my mouth before the fugitive came to me the next morning; my mouth had been opened and I was dumb no longer.</p>

<h4>The ravaging of the country (33:23–29)</h4>

<p>The word of Yahweh was then addressed to me as follows, “Son of man, the people living in those ruins on the soil of Israel say this, ‘Abraham was alone when he was given possession of this country. But we are many; the country has been given us as our heritage’.</p>

<p>“Very well, tell them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: You eat blood, you raise your eyes to your foul idols, you shed blood; are you to own the country? You rely on your swords, you engage in loathsome practices, each of you defiles his neighbour’s wife; are you to own the country?’. Tell them this, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: As I live, I swear it, those in the ruins will fall to the sword, those in the countryside I shall give to the wild animals for them to eat, and those among the crags and in caves will die of plague. I shall make the country a desolate waste, and the pride of its strength will be at an end. The mountains of Israel will be deserted and no one will pass that way again. Then they will know that I am Yahweh, when I make the country a desolate waste because of all the filthy things they have done’.</p>

<h4>The results of the preaching (33:30–33)</h4>

<p>“Son of man, the members of your nation are talking about you on the ramparts and in doorways. They keep saying to one another, ‘Come and hear the word that has come from Yahweh’. They throng towards you; my people sit down in front of you and listen to your words, but they do not act on them. What they act on is the lie in their mouths, and their hearts are set on dishonest gain. As far as they are concerned, you are like a love song pleasantly sung to a good musical accompaniment. They listen to your words, but no one acts on them. When the thing takes place — and it is beginning now — they will know that there has been a prophet among them”.</p>

<h4 id="ch34">The shepherds of Israel (34:1–31)</h4>

<p>The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows, “Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel; prophesy and say to them, ‘Shepherds, the Lord Yahweh says this: Disaster is in store for the shepherds of Israel who feed themselves! Are not shepherds meant to feed a flock? Yet you have fed on milk, you have dressed yourselves in wool, you have sacrificed the fattest sheep, but failed to feed the flock. You have failed to make weak sheep strong, or to care for the sick ones, or bandage the injured ones. You have failed to bring back strays or look for the lost. On the contrary, you have ruled them cruelly and harshly. For lack of a shepherd they have been scattered, to become the prey of all the wild animals; they have been scattered. My flock is astray on every mountain and on every high hill; my flock has been scattered all over the world; no one bothers about them and no one looks for them.</p>

<p>‘Very well, shepherds, hear the word of Yahweh: As I live, I swear it — declares the Lord Yahweh — since my flock has been pillaged and for lack of a shepherd is now the prey of every wild animal, since my shepherds have ceased to bother about my flock, since my shepherds feed themselves rather than my flock, very well, shepherds, hear the word of Yahweh: The Lord Yahweh says this: Look, I am against the shepherds. I shall take my flock out of their charge and henceforth not allow them to feed my flock. And the shepherds will stop feeding themselves, because I shall rescue my sheep from their mouths to stop them from being food for them.</p>

<p>‘For the Lord Yahweh says this: Look, I myself shall take care of my flock and look after it. As a shepherd looks after his flock when he is with his scattered sheep, so shall I look after my sheep. I shall rescue them from wherever they have been scattered on the day of clouds and darkness. I shall bring them back from the peoples where they are; I shall gather them back from the countries and bring them back to their own land. I shall pasture them on the mountains of Israel, in the ravines and in all the inhabited parts of the country. I shall feed them in good pasturage; the highest mountains of Israel will be their grazing ground. There they will rest in good grazing grounds; they will browse in rich pastures on the mountains of Israel. I myself shall pasture my sheep, I myself shall give them rest — declares the Lord Yahweh. I shall look for the lost one, bring back the stray, bandage the injured and make the sick strong. I shall watch over the fat and healthy. I shall be a true shepherd to them.</p>

<p>‘As for you, my sheep, the Lord Yahweh says this: I shall judge between sheep and sheep, between rams and he-goats. Not content to drink the clearest of the water, you foul the rest with your feet. And my sheep must graze on what your feet have trampled and drink what your feet have fouled. Very well, the Lord Yahweh says this: I myself shall judge between the fat sheep and the thin sheep. Since you have jostled with flank and shoulder and butted all the ailing sheep with your horns, until you have scattered them outside, I shall come and save my sheep and stop them from being victimised. I shall judge between sheep and sheep.</p>

<p>‘I shall raise up one shepherd, my servant David, and put him in charge of them to pasture them; he will pasture them and be their shepherd. I, Yahweh, shall be their God, and my servant David will be ruler among them. I, Yahweh, have spoken. I shall make a covenant of peace with them; I shall rid the country of wild animals. They will be able to live secure in the desert and go to sleep in the woods. I shall settle them around my hill; I shall send rain at the proper time; it will be a rain of blessings. The trees of the countryside will yield their fruit and the soil will yield its produce; they will be secure on their soil. And they will know that I am Yahweh when I break the bars of their yoke and rescue them from the clutches of their slave-masters. No more will they be a prey to the nations, no more will the wild animals of the country devour them. They will live secure, with no one to frighten them. I shall make splendid vegetation grow for them; no more will they suffer from famine in the country; no more will they have to bear the insults of other nations. So they will know that I, their God, am with them and that they, the House of Israel, are my people — declares the Lord Yahweh. And you, my sheep, are the flock of my human pasture, and I am your God — declares the Lord Yahweh’”.</p>

<h4 id="ch35">Against the mountains of Edom (35:1–9)</h4>

<p>The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows: “Son of man, turn towards Mount Seir and prophesy against it. Say to it, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Look, I am against you, Mount Seir; I shall stretch out my hand against you; I shall make you a desolate waste; I shall lay your towns in ruins. You will become a waste and you will know that I am Yahweh. Since, following a long-standing hatred, you betrayed the Israelites to the sword on the day of their distress, on the day when an end came for their guilt, very well, as I live — declares the Lord Yahweh — I destine you to bloodshed, and bloodshed will pursue you. I swear it; you have incurred guilt by shedding blood, and bloodshed will pursue you. I shall make Mount Seir a desolate waste and denude it of anyone travelling to and fro. I shall fill its mountains with its slaughtered; on your hills, in your valleys and in all your ravines, those slaughtered by the sword will fall. I shall make you a perpetual waste, your towns will never be inhabited again, and you will know that I am Yahweh.</p>

<p>‘Since you said: The two nations and the two countries will be mine; we are going to take possession of it, although Yahweh was there, very well, as I live — declares the Lord Yahweh — I shall act with the same anger and jealousy as you acted in your hatred for them. I shall make myself known for their sake, when I punish you, and you will know that I, Yahweh, have heard all the blasphemies which you have uttered against the mountains of Israel, such as: They have been laid waste, they have been given to us for us to devour. Great was your insolence towards me, many your speeches against me; I have heard! Lord Yahweh says this: To the joy of the whole world, I shall make you a waste. Since you rejoiced because the heritage of the House of Israel had been laid waste, I shall do the same to you, Mount Seir; and you will become a waste, and so will the whole of Edom; and they will know that I am Yahweh”’. 
</p>

<h4 id="ch36">Prophecy about the mountains of Israel (36:1–38)</h4>

<p>“Son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel. Say, ‘Mountains of Israel, hear the word of Yahweh. The Lord Yahweh says this: Since the enemy has gloated over you by saying: Aha! These eternal heights are owned by us now, very well, prophesy! Say: The Lord Yahweh says this: Since you have been ravaged and seized on from all sides, and have become the property of the rest of the nations, and become the subject of people’s talk and gossip, very well, mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Yahweh! The Lord Yahweh says this to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys, to the devastated ruins and abandoned cities which have been put to the sack and have become a laughing-stock to the rest of the nations all around; very well, the Lord Yahweh says this: I swear it in the heat of my jealousy; I am speaking to the rest of the nations and to the whole of Edom who so exultantly and contemptuously took possession of my country to despoil its pastureland’.</p>

<p>“Because of this, prophesy about the land of Israel. Say to the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: I am speaking in my jealousy and rage; because you are enduring the insults of the nations, very well, the Lord Yahweh says this: I raise my hand and I swear that the nations all around you shall have their own insults to bear.</p>

<p>‘Mountains of Israel, you will grow branches and bear fruit for my people Israel, who will soon return. Yes, I am coming to you, I shall turn to you; you will be tilled and sown. I shall increase your population, the whole House of Israel, yes, all. The cities will be inhabited and the ruins rebuilt. I shall increase your population, both human and animal; they will be fertile and reproduce. I shall repopulate you as you were before; I shall make you more prosperous than you were before, and you will know that I am Yahweh. Thanks to me, men will tread your soil again, my people Israel; they will own you and you will be their heritage, and never again will you rob them of their children.</p>

<p>‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Since people have said of you: You are a man-eater, you have robbed your nation of its children, very well, you will eat no more men, never rob your nation of its children again — declares the Lord Yahweh. I shall never again let you hear the insults of the nations, you will never again have to bear the taunts of the peoples, you will never again rob the nation of its children — declares the Lord Yahweh’”.</p>

<p>The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows, “Son of man, the members of the House of Israel used to live in their own territory, but they defiled it by their conduct and actions; to me their conduct was as unclean as a woman’s menstruation. I then vented my fury on them because of the blood they shed in the country and the foul idols with which they defiled it. I scattered them among the nations and they were dispersed throughout the countries. I sentenced them as their conduct and actions deserved. They have profaned my holy name among the nations where they have gone, so that people say of them, ‘These are the people of Yahweh; they have been exiled from his land’. But I have been concerned about my holy name, which the House of Israel has profaned among the nations where they have gone. And so, say to the House of Israel, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: I am acting not for your sake, House of Israel, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations where you have gone. I am going to display the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned among them. And the nations will know that I am Yahweh — declares the Lord Yahweh — when in you I display my holiness before their eyes. For I shall take you from among the nations and gather you back from all the countries, and bring you home to your own country. I shall pour clean water over you and you will be cleansed; I shall cleanse you of all your filth and of all your foul idols. I shall give you a new heart, and put a new spirit in you; I shall remove the heart of stone from your bodies and give you a heart of flesh instead. I shall put my spirit in you, and make you keep my laws, and respect and practise my judgements. You will live in the country which I gave your ancestors. You will be my people and I shall be your God. I shall save you from everything that defiles you, I shall summon the wheat and make it plentiful and impose no more famines on you. I shall increase the yield of tree and field, so that you will never again bear the ignominy of famine among the nations. Then you will remember your evil conduct and actions. You will loathe yourselves for your guilt and your loathsome practices. I assure you that I am not doing this for your sake — declares the Lord Yahweh. Be ashamed and blush for your conduct, House of Israel.</p>

<p>‘The Lord Yahweh says this: On the day I cleanse you from all your guilt, I shall repopulate the cities and cause the ruins to be rebuilt. Waste land, once desolate for every passer-by to see, will now be farmed again. And people will say: This land, so recently a waste, is now like a garden of Eden, and the ruined cities once abandoned and levelled to the ground are now strongholds with people living in them. And the nations left around you will know that I, Yahweh, have rebuilt what was levelled and replanted what was ruined. I, Yahweh, have spoken and shall do it.</p>

<p>‘The Lord Yahweh says this: As a further mark of favour, I shall let myself be consulted by the House of Israel; I shall increase their numbers like a human flock, like a flock of sacrificial animals, like the flock in Jerusalem on her solemn feasts. So your ruined cities will be filled with human flocks, and they will know that I am Yahweh’”.</p>

<h4 id="ch37">The dry bones (37:1–14)</h4>

<p>The hand of Yahweh was on me; he carried me away by the spirit of Yahweh and set me down in the middle of the valley, a valley full of bones. He made me walk up and down and all around among them. There were vast quantities of these bones on the floor of the valley; and they were completely dry. He said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?”.</p>

<p>I said, “You know, Lord Yahweh”.</p>

<p>He said, “Prophesy over these bones. Say, ‘Dry bones, hear the word of Yahweh. The Lord Yahweh says this to these bones: I am now going to make breath enter you, and you will live. I shall put sinews on you, I shall make flesh grow on you, I shall cover you with skin and give you breath, and you will live; and you will know that I am Yahweh’”. I prophesied as I had been ordered. While I was prophesying, there was a noise, a clattering sound; it was the bones coming together. And as I looked, they were covered with sinews; flesh was growing on them and skin was covering them, yet there was no breath in them. He said to me, “Prophesy to the breath; prophesy, son of man. Say to the breath, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Come from the four winds, breath; breathe on these dead, so that they come to life!’”. I prophesied as he had ordered me, and the breath entered them; they came to life and stood up on their feet, a great, an immense army.</p>

<p>Then he said, “Son of man, these bones are the whole House of Israel. They keep saying, ‘Our bones are dry, our hope has gone; we are done for’. So, prophesy. Say to them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: I am now going to open your graves; I shall raise you from your graves, my people, and lead you back to the soil of Israel. And you will know that I am Yahweh, when I open your graves and raise you from your graves, my people, and put my spirit in you, and you revive, and I resettle you on your own soil. Then you will know that I, Yahweh, have spoken and done this — declares the Lord Yahweh’”.</p>

<h4>Judah and Israel in one kingdom (37:15–28)</h4>

<p>The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows, “Son of man, take a stick and write on it, ‘Judah and those Israelites loyal to him’. Take another stick and write on it, ‘Joseph (Ephraim’s wood) and all the House of Israel loyal to him’.</p>

<p>“Join one to the other to make a single piece of wood, a single stick in your hand. And when the members of your nation say, ‘Will you not tell us what you mean?’, say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: I am taking the stick of Joseph (now in Ephraim’s hand) and those tribes of Israel loyal to him and shall join them to the stick of Judah. I shall make one stick out of the two, a single stick in my hand’.</p>

<p>“When the pieces of wood you have written on are in your hand in full sight of them, say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: I shall take the Israelites from the nations where they have gone. I shall gather them together from everywhere and bring them home to their own soil. I shall make them into one nation in the country, on the mountains of Israel, and one king is to be king of them all; they will no longer form two nations, nor be two separate kingdoms. They will no longer defile themselves with their foul idols, their horrors and any of their crimes. I shall save them from the acts of infidelity which they have committed and shall cleanse them; they will be my people and I shall be their God. My servant David will reign over them, one shepherd for all; they will follow my judgements, respect my laws and practise them. They will live in the country which I gave to my servant Jacob, the country in which your ancestors lived. They will live in it, they, their children, their children’s children, for ever. David my servant is to be their prince for ever. I shall make a covenant of peace with them, an eternal covenant with them. I shall resettle them and make them grow; I shall set my sanctuary among them for ever. I shall make my home above them; I shall be their God, and they will be my people. And the nations will know that I am Yahweh the sanctifier of Israel, when my sanctuary is with them for ever’”.</p>

<h4 id="ch38">Against Gog, king of Magog (38:1–39:20)</h4>

<p>The word of Yahweh was addressed to me as follows, “Son of man, turn towards Gog, to the country of Magog, towards the paramount prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him. Say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: I am against you, Gog, paramount prince of Meshech and Tubal. I shall turn you about, I shall fix hooks in your jaws and bring you out with your entire army, horses and horsemen, all perfectly equipped, a huge array armed with shields and bucklers, and all wielding swords. Persia and Cush and Put are with them, all with buckler and helmet; Gomer and all its troops, Beth-Togarmah in the far north and all its troops, and many nations with you. Be ready, be well prepared, you and all your troops and the others rallying to you, and hold yourself at my service.</p>

<p>‘Many days will pass before you are given orders; in the final years you will march on this country, whose inhabitants will have been living in confidence, remote from other peoples, since they escaped the sword and were gathered in from various nations, here in the long-deserted mountains of Israel. Like a storm you will approach, you will advance and cover the country like a cloud, you, all your troops and many nations with you.</p>

<p>‘The Lord Yahweh says this: That day, a thought will enter your mind and you will form a sinister plan. You will think: I shall attack this undefended country and march on this peaceful nation living secure, all living in towns without walls or bars or gates. You will come to plunder and loot and turn your might against the ruins they live in, against this people gathered back from the nations, these stock-breeders and traders who live at the Navel of the World. Sheba and Dedan, the merchants and all the magnates of Tarshish will ask you: Have you come for plunder? Are you massing your troops with a view to looting? To make off with gold and silver, seize cattle and goods, and come away with unlimited spoil?’.</p>

<p>“So, son of man, prophesy. Say to Gog, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Is it not true that you will set out at a time when my people Israel is living secure? You will leave your home in the far north, you and many nations with you, a great army of countless troops all mounted. You will invade Israel, my people. You will be like a cloud covering the country. In the final days, I myself shall bring you to attack my country, so that the nations will know who I am, when I display my holiness to them, by means of you, Gog.</p>

<p>‘The Lord Yahweh says this: It was of you that I spoke in the past through my servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those days, foretelling your invasion. The day Gog attacks the land of Israel — declares the Lord Yahweh — my furious wrath will boil up. In my anger, in my jealousy, in the heat of my fury I say it: That day, I swear, there will be such a huge earthquake in the land of Israel, that the fish in the sea and the birds of heaven, the wild beasts, all the reptiles creeping along the ground, and all people on the surface of the earth will quake before me. Mountains will fall, cliffs crumble, all walls collapse, and I shall summon every kind of sword against him — declares the Lord Yahweh — and each will turn his sword against his comrade. I shall punish him with plague and bloodshed, and rain down torrential rain, hailstones, fire and brimstone on him, on his troops and on the many nations with him. I shall display my greatness and holiness and bring the many nations to acknowledge me; and they will know that I am Yahweh’”.</p>

<p id="ch39">“So, son of man, prophesy against Gog. Say, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Look, I am against you, Gog, paramount prince of Meshech and Tubal. I shall turn you about, lead you on, and bring you from the farthest north against the mountains of Israel. I shall break the bow in your left hand and dash the arrows out of your right. You will fall on the mountains of Israel, you, all your troops and the nations with you. I shall make you food for every kind of bird of prey and wild animals. You will fall in the wilds, for I have spoken — declares the Lord Yahweh. I shall send down fire on Magog and on those living undisturbed in the islands, and they will know that I am Yahweh. I shall see that my holy name is acknowledged by my people Israel, and no longer allow my holy name to be profaned; and the nations will know that I am Yahweh, holy in Israel.</p>

<p>‘All this is to happen, all this is to take place — declares the Lord Yahweh. This is the day I predicted.</p>

<p>‘The inhabitants of the towns of Israel will go out and set fire to and burn the weapons, the shields and bucklers, bows and arrows, javelins and spears. They will burn these for seven years and not fetch wood from the countryside or cut it in the forests, since they will be burning the weapons. They will plunder those who plundered them, and despoil those who despoiled them — declares the Lord Yahweh.</p>

<p>‘That day, I shall give Gog a famous spot in Israel for his grave, the valley of the Obarim, east of the Sea — the valley that halts the traveller — and there Gog and his whole throng will be buried, and it will be called the Valley of Hamon-Gog. The House of Israel will take seven months to bury them and cleanse the country. All the people of the country will dig their graves, thus winning themselves renown, the day when I display my glory — declares the Lord Yahweh. And men will be detailed to the permanent duty of going through the country and burying those left above ground and cleansing it. They will begin their search once the seven months are over, and as they go through the country, if one of them sees any human bones, he will set up a marker beside them until the gravediggers have buried them in the valley of Hamon-Gog (and Hamonah is also the name of a town) and have cleansed the country’.</p>

<p>“Son of man, the Lord Yahweh says this, ‘Say to the birds of every kind and to all the wild animals: Muster, come, gather from everywhere around for the sacrifice I am making for you, a great sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, so that you can eat flesh and drink blood. You will eat the flesh of heroes, you will drink the blood of the princes of the world. They are all rams and lambs, goats and fat bulls of Bashan. You will glut yourselves on fat and drink yourselves drunk on blood at this sacrifice I am making for you. You will glut yourselves at my table on horses and chargers, on heroes and every kind of warrior — declares the Lord Yahweh’.</p>

<h4>Conclusion (39:21–29)</h4>

<p>“I shall display my glory to the nations, and all nations will see my sentence when I inflict it and my hand when I strike them. The House of Israel will know that I am Yahweh their God, from that day forward for ever. The nations too will know that the House of Israel were exiled for their guilt; because they were unfaithful to me, I hid my face from them and put them into the clutches of their enemies, so that they all fell by the sword. I treated them as their loathsome acts of infidelity deserved and hid my face from them.</p>

<p>“So, the Lord Yahweh says this, ‘Now I shall bring Jacob’s captives back and take pity on the whole House of Israel and show myself jealous for my holy name. They will forget their disgrace and all the acts of infidelity which they committed against me when they were living safely in their own country, with no one to disturb them. When I bring them home from the peoples, when I gather them back from the countries of their enemies, when I display my holiness in them for many nations to see, they will know that I am Yahweh their God who, having sent them into exile among the nations, have reünited them in their own country, not leaving a single one behind. I shall never hide my face from them again, since I shall pour out my spirit on the House of Israel — declares the Lord Yahweh’”.</p>

<h2 id="iv">IV: The Torah of Ezekiel (40:1–48:35)</h2>

<h4>The future Temple (40:1–4)</h4>

<p>In the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month, fourteen years to the day from the capture of the city, the hand of Yahweh was on me. He carried me away: in divine visions, he carried me away to the land of Israel and put me down on a very high mountain, on the south of which there seemed to be built a city. He took me to it, and there I saw a man, whose appearance was like brass. He had a flax cord and a measuring rod in his hand and was standing in the gateway. The man said to me, “Son of man, look carefully, listen closely and pay attention to everything I show you, since you have been brought here only for me to show it to you. Tell the House of Israel everything that you see”.</p>

<h4>The outer wall (40:5)</h4>

<p>Now, the Temple was surrounded on all sides by an outer wall. The man was holding a measuring rod six cubits long, each cubit a forearm and a handsbreadth. He measured the thickness of this construction — one rod; and its height — one rod.</p>

<h4>The east gate (40:6–16)</h4>

<p>He went to the east gate, climbed the steps and measured its threshold: one rod deep. Each guardroom one rod by one rod; and the piers between the guardrooms five cubits thick, and the threshold of the gate inwards from the porch of the gate: one rod. He measured the porch of the gate: eight cubits; its piers: two cubits; the porch of the gate was at the inner end. There were three guardrooms on each side of the east gate, all three of the same size; the piers between them all of the same thickness each side. He measured the width of the entrance: ten cubits; and the width all down the gateway: thirteen cubits. There was a rail in front of the guardrooms; each rail on either side was one cubit. And the guardrooms on either side were six cubits square. He measured the width of the gate from the back wall of one guardroom to the back wall of the other; it was twenty-five cubits across, the openings being opposite each other. He measured the porch: twenty cubits; the court surrounded the gate on all sides. From the front of the entrance gate, to the far end of the porch of the inner gate: fifty cubits. All around inside the gate there were trellised windows in the guardrooms and in their piers; similarly, in the porch there were windows all around and palm trees on the piers.</p>

<h4>The outer court (40:17–19)</h4>

<p>He then took me to the outer court, which had rooms and a paved terrace going all the way around; there were thirty rooms on this terrace. This terrace, which came up to the sides of the gates and matched their depth, was the Lower Terrace. He measured the width of the court, from the front of the lower gate to the façade of the inner court, outside: a hundred cubits (on the east and on the north).</p>

<h4>The north gate (40:20–23)</h4>

<p>He measured the length and breadth of the north gate of the outer court. It had three guardrooms on each side; its piers and porch were of the same size as those of the first gate: fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. Its windows, its porch and its palm trees were of the same size as those of the east gate. There were seven steps up to it, and its porch was at the inner end. In the inner court there was, opposite the north gate, a gate like the one opposite the east gate. He measured the distance from one gate to the other: a hundred cubits.</p>

<h4>The south gate (40:24–27)</h4>

<p>He took me to the south side where there was a south gate; he measured its guardrooms, piers and porch; they were of the same size as the others. The gateway, as well as its porch, had windows all around, like the windows of the others; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide, and it had seven steps up to it; its porch was at the inner end and had palm trees on its piers, one on either side. The inner court had a south gate; he measured the distance southwards from one gate to the other: a hundred cubits.</p>

<h4>The inner court. The south gate (40:28–31)</h4>

<p>He then took me into the inner court by the south gate; he measured the south gate which was of the same size as the others. Its guardrooms, piers and porch were of the same size as the others. The gateway, as well as its porch, had windows all around; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. The porch gave on to the outer court. It had palm trees on its piers and eight steps leading up to it.</p>

<h4>The east gate (40:32–34)</h4>

<p>He took me to the eastern part of the inner court and measured the gate. It was of the same size as the others. Its guardrooms, piers and porch were of the same size as the others. The gateway, as well as its porch, had windows all around; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. Its porch gave on to the outer court. There were palm trees on its piers on either side and eight steps leading up to it.</p>

<h4>The north gate (40:355–37)</h4>

<p>He then took me to the north gate and measured it. Its guardrooms, piers and porch were of the same size as the others. The gateway had windows all around; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits wide. Its porch gave on to the outer court. There were palm trees on its piers on either side and eight steps leading up to it.</p>

<h4>Subsidiary buildings at the gate (40:38–46)</h4>

<p>There was a room, the entrance to which was in the porch of the gateway, where they washed the burnt offerings. And inside the porch of the gateway were slabs, two on either side, for slaughtering the burnt offerings, the sacrifice for sin and the sacrifice of reparation. Outside, at the approach to the entrance of the north gate, were two slabs, and on the other side, at the porch end of the gate were two slabs. There were four slabs on one side and four slabs on the other side of the gateway, eight slabs in all, on which the slaughtering was done. There were also four slabs of dressed stone for the burnt offerings, a cubit and a half long, a cubit and a half wide and a cubit high, on which the instruments for slaughtering the burnt offerings and sacrifice were placed; runnels a handsbreadth wide went all around the top, and on these slabs was put the sacrificial flesh.</p>

<p>Then he took me into the inner court; there were two rooms in the inner court, one on the side of the north gate, facing south, the other on the side of the south gate, facing north. He told me, “The room looking south is for the priests responsible for the service of the Temple, and the room looking north is for the priests responsible for the service of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok, those of the sons of Levi who approach Yahweh to serve him”.</p>

<h4>The inner court (40:47)</h4>

<p>He measured the court; it was a hundred cubits long and a hundred cubits wide, a square with the altar standing in front of the Temple.</p>

<h4>The Temple. The Ulam (40:48–49)</h4>

<p>He took me to the Ulam of the Temple and measured the piers of the Ulam: five cubits either side; and the width of the entrance was three cubits either side. The length of the Ulam was twenty cubits and its width twelve cubits. There were ten steps leading up to it, and there were columns by the piers, one on either side.</p>

<h4 id="ch41">The Hekal (41:1–2)</h4>

<p>He took me to the Hekal and measured its piers: six cubits wide on the one side, six cubits wide on the other. The width of the entrance was ten cubits, and the returns of the entrance were five cubits on the one side and five cubits on the other. He measured its length: forty cubits; and its width: twenty cubits.</p>

<h4>The Debir (41:3–4)</h4>

<p>He then went inside and measured the pier at the entrance: two cubits; then the entrance; six cubits; and the returns of the entrance: seven cubits. He measured its length; twenty cubits; and its width against the Hekal: twenty cubits. He then said to me, This is the Holy of Holies”.</p>

<h4>The side cells (41:5–11)</h4>

<p>He then measured the wall of the Temple: six cubits. The width of the lateral structure was four cubits, all around the Temple. The cells were one above the other in three tiers of thirty cells each. The cells were recessed into the wall, the wall of the structure comprising the cells, all around, forming offsets; but there were no offsets in the wall of the Temple itself. The width of the cells increased, storey by storey, corresponding to the amount taken in from the wall from one storey to the next, all around the Temple.</p>

<p>Then I saw that there was a paved terrace all around the Temple. The height of this, which formed the base of the side cells, was one complete rod of six cubits. The outer wall of the side cells was five cubits thick. There was a passage between the cells of the Temple and the rooms, twenty cubits wide, all around the Temple. As a way in to the lateral cells on the passage there was one entrance on the north side and one entrance on the south side. The width of the passage was five cubits right around.</p>

<h4>The building on the west side (41:12–15a)</h4>

<p>The building on the west side of the court was seventy cubits wide, the wall of the building was five cubits thick all around and its length was ninety cubits. He measured the length of the Temple: a hundred cubits. The length of the court plus the building and its walls: a hundred cubits. He measured the length of the building, along the court, at the back, and its galleries on either side: a hundred cubits.</p>

<h4>Particulars of the Temple itself (41:15b–21a)</h4>

<p>The inside of the Hekal and the porches of the court, the thresholds, the windows, the galleries on three sides, facing the threshold, were panelled with wood all around from floor to windows, and the windows were screened with latticework. From the door to the inner part of the Temple, as well as outside, and on the wall all around, both inside and out, were carved great winged creatures and palm trees, one palm tree between two winged creatures; each winged creature had two faces: a human face turned towards the palm tree on one side and the face of a lion towards the palm tree on the other side, throughout the Temple, all around. Winged creatures and palm trees were carved on the wall from the floor to above the entrance. The doorposts of the Temple were square.</p>

<h4>The wooden altar (41:21b–22)</h4>

<p>In front of the sanctuary there was something like a wooden altar, three cubits high and two cubits square. Its corners, base and sides were of wood. He said to me, “This is the table in the presence of Yahweh”.</p>

<h4>The doors (41:23–26)</h4>

<p>The Hekal had double doors and the sanctuary double doors. These doors had two hinged leaves, two leaves for the one door, two leaves for the other. On them (on the doors of the Hekal), were carved great winged creatures and palm trees like those carved on the walls. There was a wooden porch roof on the front of the Ulam on the outside, and windows with flanking palm trees on the sides of the Ulam, the cells to the side of the Temple and the porch-roofs.</p>

<h4 id="ch42">Subsidiary buildings of the Temple (42:1–14)</h4>

<p>He then took me out into the outer court on the north side and led me to the room facing the court, that is to say, to the front of the building on the north side. Along the front, it was a hundred cubits long on the north side and fifty cubits wide. Facing the gateways of the inner court and facing the paving of the outer court was a gallery in front of the triple gallery, and in front of the rooms was a walk, ten cubits measured inwards and a hundred cubits long; their doors looked north. The top-floor rooms were narrow because the galleries took up part of the width, being narrower than those on the ground floor or those on the middle floor of the building; these were divided into three storeys and had no columns such as the court had. Hence they were narrower than the ground floor ones or the middle-floor ones (below them). The outer wall parallel to the rooms, facing them and giving onto the outer court, was fifty cubits long, the length of the rooms facing the outer court being fifty cubits, while for those facing the hall of the Temple it was a hundred cubits. Beneath the rooms there was an entrance from the east, leading in from the outer court.</p>

<p>In the thickness of the wall of the court, on the south side fronting the court and the building, were rooms. A walk ran in front of them, as with the rooms built on the north side; they were of the same length and breadth, and were of similar design with similar doors in and out. Before the rooms on the south side there was an entrance at the end of each walk, opposite the corresponding wall on the east side, at their entries. He said to me, “The northern and southern rooms giving onto the court are the rooms of the sanctuary, in which the priests who approach Yahweh will eat the most holy things. In them will be placed the most holy things: the oblation, the sacrifice for sin and the sacrifice of reparation, since this is a holy place. Once the priests have entered, they will not go out of the holy place into the outer court without leaving their liturgical vestments there, since these vestments are holy; they will put on other clothes before going near places assigned to the people”.</p>

<h4>Measurements of the court (42:15–20)</h4>

<p>When he had finished measuring the inside of the Temple, he took me out to the east gate and measured it right around the sides. He measured the east side with his measuring rod: a total of five hundred cubits by the measuring rod. He then measured the north side: a total of five hundred cubits by the measuring rod. He then measured the south side: five hundred cubits by the measuring rod was the total. On the west side he measured five hundred cubits by the measuring rod. He measured the entire enclosing wall on all four sides: length five hundred, breadth five hundred, separating the sacred from the profane.</p>

<h4 id="ch43">The return of Yahweh (43:1–12)</h4>

<p>He took me to the gate, the one facing east. I saw the glory of the God of Israel approaching from the east. A sound came with him like the sound of the ocean, and the earth shone with his glory. This vision was like the one I had seen when I had come for the destruction of the city, and like the one I had seen by the River Chebar. Then I fell to the ground.</p>

<p>The glory of Yahweh arrived at the Temple by the east gate. The Spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court; I saw the glory of Yahweh fill the Temple. And I heard someöne speaking to me from the Temple while the man stood beside me. He said, “Son of man, this is the dais of my throne, the step on which I rest my feet. I shall live here among the Israelites for ever; and the House of Israel, they and their kings, will never again defile my holy name with their whorings and the corpses of their kings, by putting their threshold beside my threshold and their doorposts beside my door-posts, with a party wall shared by them and me. They used to defile my holy name by their loathsome practices, and this is why I put an end to them in my anger. From now on they will banish their whorings and the corpses of their kings from my presence and I shall live among them for ever.</p>

<p>“Son of man, describe this Temple to the House of Israel, to shame them out of their loathsome practices. (Let them draw up the plan of it.) And, if they are ashamed of their behaviour, show them the design and plan of the Temple, its exits and entrances, its shape, how all of it is arranged, the entire design and all its principles. Give them all this in writing so that they can see and take note of its design and the way it is all arranged and carry it out. This is the charter of the Temple: all the surrounding space on the mountain top is an especially holy area. (Such is the charter of the Temple.)”</p>

<h4>The altar (43:13–17)</h4>

<p>These were the dimensions of the altar, in cubits each of a cubit plus a handsbreadth. The base: one cubit high and one cubit wide; the space by the runnel, all around the edge of the altar, one handsbreadth. From the ground level of the base up to the lower plinth, two cubits high and one cubit wide; from the lesser plinth to the greater plinth, four cubits high and one cubit wide. The altar hearth: four cubits high, with four horns projecting from the hearth, the hearth was four-square: twelve cubits by twelve cubits; and the square plinth: fourteen cubits by fourteen cubits; and the ledge all around: half a cubit; and the base: one cubit all around. The steps were on the east side.</p>

<h4>The consecration of the altar (43:18–27)</h4>

<p>He said to me, “Son of man, the Lord Yahweh says this, ‘As regards the altar, this is how things must be done when it has been built for the sacrifice of the burnt offering and for the pouring of blood. To the levitical priests — those of the race of Zadok — who approach me to serve me — declares the Lord Yahweh — you must give a young bull as a sacrifice for sin. You must take some of its blood and put it on the four horns, on the four corners of the plinth and on the surrounding ledge. In this way you will purify it and make expiation on it. Then take the bull of the sacrifice for sin and burn it in that part of the Temple which is cut off from the sanctuary. On the second day, you must offer an unblemished he-goat as the sacrifice for sin, and the altar must be purified again as was done with the bull. When you have finished the purification, you must offer a young, unblemished bull and an unblemished ram from the flock. You must present them before Yahweh, and the priests will sprinkle salt on them and offer them as burnt offerings to Yahweh. As a sacrifice for sin, every day for seven days you must offer a he-goat, a bull and an unblemished ram from the flock. In this way the altar will be expiated and will be purified and inaugurated. At the end of that time, on the eighth day and afterwards, the priest will offer your burnt offerings and your communion sacrifices on the altar, and I shall look favourably on you — declares the Lord Yahweh’”.</p>

<h4 id="ch44">The use of the east gate (44:1–3)</h4>

<p>He brought me back to the outer east gate of the sanctuary. It was shut. Yahweh said to me, “This gate will be kept shut. No one may open it or go through it, since Yahweh, God of Israel, has been through it. And so it must be kept shut. The prince himself, however, may sit there to take his meal in the presence of Yahweh. He must enter and leave through the porch of the gate”.</p>

<h4>Rules of admission to the Temple (44:4–9)</h4>

<p>He led me through the north gate to the front of the Temple. And then I looked; I saw the glory of Yahweh filling the Temple of Yahweh; and I fell to the ground. Yahweh said to me, “Son of man, pay attention, look carefully and listen closely to everything I explain; these are all the arrangements of the Temple of Yahweh and all its laws. Be careful about who is admitted to the Temple and who is excluded from the sanctuary. And say to the rebels of the House of Israel, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: You have gone beyond all bounds with all your loathsome practices, House of Israel, by admitting aliens, uncircumcised in heart and body, to frequent my sanctuary and profane my Temple, while offering my food, the fat and the blood, and breaking my covenant with all your loathsome practices. Instead of maintaining the service of my holy things, you have deputed someöne else to maintain my service in my sanctuary. The Lord Yahweh says this: No alien, uncircumcised in heart and body, may enter my sanctuary, none of the aliens living among the Israelites.</p>

<h4>The Levites (44:10–14)</h4>

<p>‘As regards the Levites who abandoned me when Israel strayed far from me by following its idols, they must bear the weight of their own sin. They must be servants in my sanctuary, responsible for guarding the Temple gates and serving the Temple. They will kill the burnt offerings and the sacrifice for the people, and hold themselves at the service of the people. Since they used to be at their service in front of their idols and were an occasion of guilt for the House of Israel, very well, I stretch out my hand against them — declares the Lord Yahweh — they will bear the weight of their guilt. They may never approach me again to perform the priestly office in my presence, nor touch my holy things and my most holy things; they must bear the disgrace of their loathsome practices. I shall give them the responsibility of serving the Temple; I shall make them responsible for serving it and for everything to be done in it.</p>

<h4>The priests (44:15–31)</h4>

<p>‘As regards the levitical priests, the sons of Zadok, who maintained the service of my sanctuary when the Israelites strayed far from me, they will approach me to serve me; they will stand in my presence to offer me the fat and blood — declares the Lord Yahweh. They will enter my sanctuary and approach my table to serve me; they will maintain my service. Once they enter the gates of the inner court, they must wear linen vestments; they must wear no wool when they serve inside the gates of the inner court and in the Temple. They must wear linen caps on their heads and linen breeches on their loins; they may not wear anything around their waists that makes them sweat. When they go out to the people in the outer court, they must remove the vestments in which they have performed the liturgy and leave them in the rooms of the Holy Place, and put on other clothes, so as not to hallow the people with their vestments. They may neither shave their heads nor let their hair grow long, but must cut their hair carefully. No priest may drink wine on the day he enters the inner court. They may not marry widows or divorced women, but only virgins of the race of Israel; they may, however, marry a widow, if she is the widow of a priest. They must teach my people the difference between what is sacred and what is profane and make them understand the difference between what is clean and what is unclean. They must be judges in law-suits; they must judge in the spirit of my judgements; they must follow my laws and ordinances at all my feasts and keep my Sabbaths holy. They may not go near a dead person, in case they become unclean, except in these permissible cases, that is, for father, mother, daughter, son, brother or unmarried sister. After one of them has been purified, seven days must elapse; then, the day he enters the Holy Place in the inner court to minister in the Holy Place, he must offer his sacrifice for sin — declares the Lord Yahweh. They may have no heritage; I myself shall be their heritage. You may give them no patrimony in Israel; I myself shall be their patrimony. Their food must be the oblation, the sacrifice for sin and the sacrifice of reparation. Everything dedicated by vow in Israel shall be for them. The best of all your first-fruits and of all the dues and of everything you offer, must go to the priests; and the best of your dough you must also give to the priests, so that a blessing may rest on your house. Priests must not eat the flesh of anything that has died a natural death or been savaged, be it bird or animal’”.</p>

<h4 id="ch45">The division of the country. The portion for Yahweh (45:1–6)</h4>

<p>“‘When you draw lots to divide the country by heritage, you must set a sacred portion of the country aside for Yahweh: twenty-five thousand cubits long and twenty thousand wide. The whole of this land must be sacred, and of this an area five hundred by five hundred cubits must be for the sanctuary, with a boundary fifty cubits wide right around. Out of this area you must also measure a section twenty-five thousand by ten thousand cubits, in which will be the sanctuary, the Holy of Holies. This will be the sacred portion of the country, belonging to the priests who officiate in the sanctuary and approach Yahweh to serve him. It will contain room for their houses and room for the sanctuary. A portion twenty-five thousand by ten thousand cubits will be owned by the Levites serving the Temple, with towns for them to live in. You must give the city possession of an area five thousand by twenty-five thousand cubits, near the land belonging to the sanctuary; this must be for the whole House of Israel.</p>

<h4>The portion for the prince (45:7–12)</h4>

<p>‘The prince must have a territory either side of the sacred portion and of the property of the city, adjacent to the sacred portion and the property of the city, stretching westwards from the west and eastwards from the east, its size equal to one of the portions between the west and the east frontiers of the country. This will be his property in Israel. Then my princes will no longer oppress my people; they must leave the rest of the country for the House of Israel, for its tribes.</p>

<p>‘The Lord Yahweh says this: Enough, princes of Israel! Give up your violence and plundering, do what is upright and just, stop crushing my people with taxation — declares the Lord Yahweh. Have fair scales, a fair <i>ephah</i>, a fair <i>bat</i>. Let the <i>ephah</i> and <i>bat</i> be equal, let the <i>bat</i> hold one-tenth of a <i>homer</i> and the <i>ephah</i> one-tenth of a <i>homer</i>. Let the measures be based on the <i>homer</i>. The shekel must be twenty <i>gerah</i>. Twenty shekels, twenty-five shekels and fifteen shekels must make one <i>mina</i>.
</p>

<h4>Offerings for worship (45:13–17)</h4>

<p>‘This is the offering that you must levy: the sixth of an <i>ephah</i> for every <i>homer</i> of wheat, and the sixth of an <i>ephah</i> for every <i>homer</i> of barley. The dues on oil: one <i>bat</i> of oil out of every ten <i>bat</i> or out of every <i>kor</i> (which is equal to ten <i>bat</i> or one <i>homer</i>, since ten <i>bat</i> equal one <i>homer</i>). You must levy one sheep on every flock of two hundred from the pastures of Israel for the oblation, the burnt offerings and the communion sacrifice. This must form your expiation — declares the Lord Yahweh. Let all the people of the country be subject to this due for the prince of Israel. The prince must make himself responsible for providing the burnt offerings, the oblation and the libations for feasts, New Moons, Sabbaths and all the solemn festivals of the House of Israel. He must provide the sacrifice for sin, the oblation, the burnt offerings and the communion sacrifices to make expiation for the House of Israel.</p>

<h4>The feast of the Passover (45:18–24)</h4>

<p>‘The Lord Yahweh says this: On the first day of the first month, you must take a young bull without blemish, to purify the sanctuary. The priest must take blood from the sacrifice for sin and put it on the doorposts of the Temple, on the four corners of the altar plinth and on the doorposts of the gates of the inner court. You must do the same on the seventh of the month, on behalf of anyone who has sinned through inadvertence or ignorance. This is how you must make expiation for the Temple. On the fourteenth day of the first month, you must celebrate the feast of the Passover. For seven days everyone must eat unleavened loaves. On that day, the prince must offer a bull as a sacrifice for sin, for himself and all the people of the country. For the seven days of the feast, he must offer Yahweh burnt offerings of seven bulls and seven rams without blemish, daily for a week, and one he-goat daily as a sacrifice for sin, and as an oblation, one <i>ephah</i> for each bull and one <i>ephah</i> for each ram, and a <i>hin</i> of oil for every <i>ephah</i>.</p>

<h4>The feast of Shelters (45:25)</h4>

<p>‘For the feast that falls on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, he must do the same for seven days, offering the sacrifice for sin, the burnt offerings, the oblation and the oil’”.</p>

<h4 id="ch46">Miscellaneous regulations (46:1–24)</h4>

<p>“‘The Lord Yahweh says this: The east gate of the inner court must be kept shut for the six working days. On the Sabbath day, however, it must be opened, as also on the day of the New Moon; and the prince must go in through the porch of the outer gate and take his position by the doorposts of the gate. The priests must then offer his burnt offerings and his communion sacrifice. He must prostrate himself on the threshold of the gate and go out, and the gate must not be shut again until the evening. The people of the country must prostrate themselves in the presence of Yahweh at the entrance to the gate on Sabbaths and days of the New Moon. The burnt offering offered to Yahweh by the prince on the Sabbath day must consist of six unblemished lambs and one unblemished ram, with an oblation of one <i>ephah</i> for the ram, and such oblation as he pleases for the lambs, and a <i>hin</i> of oil for every <i>ephah</i>. On the day of the New Moon it must consist of an unblemished young bull, six unblemished lambs and one unblemished ram, when he must make an oblation of one <i>ephah</i> for the bull and one <i>ephah</i> for the ram, and what he pleases for the lambs, and a <i>hin</i> of oil for every <i>ephah</i>.</p>

<p>‘When the prince goes in, he must enter by the porch of the gate, and he must leave by the same way. When the people of the country come into the presence of Yahweh at the solemn festivals, those who have come in by the north gate to prostrate themselves must go out by the south gate, and those who have come in by the south gate must go out by the north gate; no one must turn back to leave through the gate by which he entered but must go out on the opposite side. The prince will be with them, coming in like them and going out like them.</p>

<p>‘On feast days and solemn festivals the oblation must be one <i>ephah</i> for every bull, one <i>ephah</i> for every ram, what he pleases for the lambs, and a <i>hin</i> of oil for every <i>ephah</i>. When the prince offers Yahweh voluntary burnt offerings or a voluntary communion sacrifice, the east gate must be opened for him, and he must offer his burnt offerings and his communion sacrifice as he does on the Sabbath day; when he has gone out, the gate must be shut after him. Every day he must offer an unblemished lamb one year old as a burnt offering to Yahweh; he must offer this every morning. Every morning in addition he must offer an oblation of one-sixth of an <i>ephah</i> and one-third of a <i>hin</i> of oil, for mixing with the flour. This is the oblation to Yahweh, a perpetual decree, fixed for ever. The lamb, the oblation and the oil must be offered morning after morning for ever.</p>

<p>‘Lord Yahweh says this: If the prince presents part of his hereditary portion to one of his sons, the gift must pass into the ownership of his sons and become their hereditary property. If, however, he presents part of his hereditary portion to one of his slaves, it will belong to the man only until the year of liberation and then must revert to the prince. Only his sons may retain his hereditary portion. The prince may not take any part of the people’s hereditary portion, thus robbing them of what is theirs; he must provide the patrimony of his sons out of his own property, so that no member of my people is robbed of what is his!’”.</p>

<p>He took me through the entrance at the side of the north gate that leads to the rooms of the Holy Place set apart for the priests. And there before us, to the west, was a space at the end. He said to me, This is where the priests must boil the slaughtered animals for the sacrifice for sin and the sacrifice of reparation, and where they must bake the oblation, without having to carry them into the outer court and so run the risk of hallowing the people”. He then took me into the outer court and led me to each of its four corners; in each corner of the outer court was a compound; in other words, the four corners of the court contained four small compounds, forty cubits by thirty, all four being the same size. All four were enclosed by a wall, with hearths all around the bottom of the wall. He said, “These are the kitchens where the Temple servants must boil the sacrifices offered by the people”.</p>

<h4 id="ch47">The spring in the Temple (47:1–12)</h4>

<p>He brought me back to the entrance of the Temple, where a stream flowed eastwards from under the Temple threshold, for the Temple faced east. The water flowed from under the right side of the Temple, south of the altar. He took me out by the north gate and led me right around outside as far as the outer east gate where the water flowed out on the right-hand side. The man went off to the east holding his measuring line and measured off a thousand cubits; he then made me wade across the stream; the water reached my ankles. He measured off another thousand and made me wade across the stream again; the water reached my knees. He measured off another thousand and made me wade across the stream again; the water reached my waist. He measured off another thousand; it was now a river which I could not cross; the stream had swollen and was now deep water, a river impossible to cross. He then said, “Do you see, son of man?”. He then took me and brought me back to the bank on the river. Now, when I reached it, I saw an enormous number of trees on each bank of the river. He said, “This water flows east down to the Arabah and to the sea; and flowing into the sea it makes its waters wholesome. Wherever the river flows, all living creatures teeming in it will live. Fish will be very plentiful, for wherever the water goes it brings health, and life teems wherever the river flows. There will be fishermen on its banks. Fishing nets will be spread from En-Gedi to En-Eglaim. The species of fish will be the same as the fish of the Great Sea. The marshes and lagoons, however, will not become wholesome, but will remain salt. Along the river, on either bank, will grow every kind of fruit tree with leaves that never wither and fruit that never fails; they will bear new fruit every month, because this water comes from the sanctuary. And their fruit will be good to eat and the leaves medicinal”.</p>

<h4>The frontiers of the Holy Land</h4>

<p>“The Lord Yahweh says this, ‘This will be the territory which you must distribute among the twelve tribes of Israel, with two portions for Joseph. You will each have a fair share of it, since I swore to your fathers that I would give it to them, and this country now falls to you as your heritage. These will be the frontiers of the country. On the north, from the Great Sea, the road from Hethlon to the Pass of Hamath, Zedad, Berothah, Sibraim lying between the territories of Damascus and Hamath, to Hazer-ha-Tikon on the borders of Hauran; the frontier will extend from the sea to Hazer-Enon, with the territory of Damascus and the territory of Hamath to the north; that will be the northern frontier. On the east, the Jordan will serve as frontier between Hauran and Damascus, between Gilead and Israel, down to the Eastern Sea as far as Tamar; that will be the eastern frontier. On the south, from Tamar southward to the Waters of Meribah in Kadesh, to the Wadi and the Great Sea; that will be the southern frontier. And to the west, the Great Sea will serve as frontier up to the point opposite the Pass of Hamath; that will be the western frontier. You must distribute this country among yourselves, among the tribes of Israel. You must distribute it as a heritage for yourselves and the aliens settled among you who have fathered children among you, since you must treat them as citizens of Israel. They must draw lots for their heritage with you, among the tribes of Israel. You will give the alien his heritage in the tribe where he has settled — declares the Lord Yahweh’”.</p>

<h4 id="ch48">Distribution of the Holy Land (48:1–29)</h4>

<p>“‘This is the list of the tribes. One portion in the far north by way of Hethlon to the Pass of Hamath, to Hazer-Enon, with the territory of Damascus to the north, and marching with Hamath, from the eastern limit to the western limit: Dan. One portion bordering Dan, from the eastern limit to the western limit: Asher. One portion bordering Asher, from the eastern limit to the western limit: Naphtali. One portion bordering Naphtali, from the eastern limit to the western limit: Manasseh. One portion bordering Manasseh, from the eastern limit to the western limit: Ephraim. One portion bordering Ephraim, from the eastern limit to the western limit: Reuben. One portion bordering Reuben, from the eastern limit to the western limit: Judah. One portion bordering Judah, from the eastern limit to the western limit, is the portion which you must set aside, twenty-five thousand cubits wide, and as long as each of the other portions from the eastern limit to the western limit. The sanctuary will be in the centre of it.</p>

<p>‘The portion which you must set aside for Yahweh must be twenty-five thousand cubits long and ten thousand cubits wide. This sacred portion must belong to the priests, being, on the north side, twenty-five thousand cubits; on the west side ten thousand cubits wide, on the east side ten thousand cubits wide and on the south side twenty-five thousand cubits long; the sanctuary of Yahweh will be in the centre of it. This will be for the consecrated priests, those of the sons of Zadok who maintained my liturgy and did not go astray with the straying Israelites, as the Levites went astray. And so their portion must be taken out of the especially holy portion of the land, near the territory of the Levites. The territory of the Levites, like the territory of the priests, must be twenty-five thousand cubits long and ten thousand wide — the whole length being twenty-five thousand and the width ten thousand. It will be illegal for them to sell or exchange any part of it, and the domain can never be alienated, since it is consecrated to Yahweh. As regards the remainder, an area of five thousand cubits by twenty-five thousand, this must be for the common use of the city, for houses and pastures. In the middle will be the city. These will be its dimensions: on the north side, four thousand five hundred cubits; on the south side, four thousand five hundred cubits; on the east side, four thousand five hundred cubits; on the west side, four thousand five hundred cubits. The pasture land of the city must extend two hundred and fifty cubits to the north, two hundred and fifty to the south, two hundred and fifty to the east, two hundred and fifty to the west. One strip, contiguous to the sacred portion, must be left over, consisting often thousand cubits to eastward and ten thousand to westward, marching with the sacred portion; this will bring in a revenue for feeding the municipal workmen. And the municipal workmen, drawn from all the tribes of Israel, will farm it. The portion must have a total area of twenty-five thousand cubits by twenty-five thousand. You must allocate a square area from the sacred portion to constitute the city. What is left over will be for the prince, on either side of the sacred portion and of the property of the city, marching with the twenty-five thousand cubits to eastward to the eastern frontier, and marching with the twenty-five thousand cubits to westward to the western frontier — running parallel with the other portions and belonging to the prince. In the centre will be the sacred portion and the sanctuary of the Temple. Thus, apart from the property of the Levites and the property of the city which lie in the middle of the prince’s portion, everything between the borders of Judah and the borders of Benjamin must belong to the prince.</p>

<p>‘As regards the rest of the tribes: One portion from the eastern limit to the western limit: Benjamin. One portion bordering Benjamin, from the eastern limit to the western limit: Simeon. One portion bordering Simeon, from the eastern limit to the western limit: Issachar. One portion bordering Issachar, from the eastern limit to the western limit: Zebulun. One portion bordering Zebulun, from the eastern limit to the western limit: Gad. On the southern border of Gad, on the south side, the border will run from Tamar to the Waters of Meribah in Kadesh, to the Wadi and the Great Sea. This is how you must distribute the country to the tribes of Israel as their heritage, and these must be their portions — declares the Lord Yahweh.</p>

<h4>The gates of Jerusalem (48:30–35)</h4>

<p>‘Here are the exits from the city. On the north side, four thousand five hundred cubits are to be measured off. The gates of the city are to be named after the tribes of Israel. Three gates to the north: one the gate of Reuben; one the gate of Judah; one the gate of Levi. On the east side, there will be four thousand five hundred cubits and three gates: one the gate of Joseph; one the gate of Benjamin; one the gate of Dan. On the south side, four thousand five hundred cubits are to be measured off, and there are to be three gates: one the gate of Simeon; one the gate of Issachar; one the gate of Zebulun. On the west side, there will be four thousand five hundred cubits and three gates: one the gate of Gad; one the gate of Asher; one the gate of Naphtali. Total perimeter: eighteen thousand cubits. The name of the city in future must be: Yahweh-is-there’”.</p>
