2Ma 1:1 “To their brothers, the Jews living in Egypt, from their brothers, the Jews in Jerusalem and Judaea,
greetings and untroubled peace.

2Ma 1 :2 “May God prosper you, remembering his covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, his faithful
servants.

2Ma 1 :3 May he give you all a heart to worship him and to do his will with a generous mind and a willing spirit.
2Ma 1:4 May he open your hearts to his Law and his precepts, and give you peace.

2Ma 1 :5 May he hear your prayers and be reconciled with you, and not abandon you in time of evil.

2Ma 1:6 Such is our prayer for you.

2Ma 1:7 “During the reign of Demetrius, in the year 169, we Jews wrote to you as follows, ‘In the extremity of
trouble that befell us in the years after Jason and his associates had betrayed the Holy Land and the kingdom,

2Ma 1:8 burning down the Temple gateway and shedding innocent blood, we prayed to the Lord and were then

heard. And we then offered a sacrifice, with wheat-flour, we lit the lamps and we set out the loaves’.

2Ma 1 :9 “And we now recommend you too to keep the feast of Shelters in the month of Chislev, in the year one
hundred and eighty-eight”.

2Ma 1:10 “The people of Jerusalem and of Judaea, the senate and Judas, to Aristobulus, tutor to King Ptolemy
and one of the family of the anointed priests, and to the Jews in Egypt, greetings and good health.

2Ma 1:11 “Since we have been rescued by God from great danger, we give him great thanks for championing
our cause against the king,

2Ma 1:12 for he it was who carried off those who had taken up arms against the Holy City.

2Ma 1:13 For when their leader reached Persia with his seemingly irresistible army, he was cut to pieces in the
temple of Nanaea, as the result of a ruse employed by the priests who served that goddess.

2Ma 1:14 On the pretext of marrying Nanaea, Antiochus came to the place with his friends, intending to take its
many treasures as a dowry.

2Ma 1:15 The priests of Nanaea had put these on display, and he for his part had entered the temple precincts
with only a small retinue. As soon as Antiochus had gone inside the temple, the priests shut him in,

2Ma 1:16 opened a trap-door hidden in the ceiling and struck the leader down by hurling stones like



thunderbolts. They then cut him into pieces and threw his head to those who were waiting outside.

2Ma 1:17 Blessed in all things be our God, who has delivered the sacrilegious over to death!

2Ma 1:18 “As we shall be celebrating the purification of the Temple on the twenty-fifth of Chislev, we consider it
proper to notify you, so that you too may celebrate it, as you do the feast of Shelters and the fire that appeared
when Nehemiah, the builder of the Temple and the altar, offered sacrifice.

2Ma 1:19 For when our ancestors were being deported to Persia, the devout priests of the time took some of
the fire from the altar and hid it secretly in a hole like a dry well, where they concealed it in such a way that the
place was unknown to anyone.

2Ma 1 :20 When some years had elapsed, in God’s good time, Nehemiah, commissioned by the king of Persia,
sent the descendants of the priests who had hidden the fire to look for it. When they reported that in fact they
had found not fire but a thick liquid, Nehemiah ordered them to draw some out and bring it back.

2Ma 1 :21 When they had done this, Nehemiah ordered the priests to pour this liquid over the sacrificial
materials, that is, the wood and what lay on it.

2Ma 1:22 When this had been done, and when in due course the sun, which had previously been clouded over,
shone out, a great fire flared up, to the astonishment of all.

2Ma 1:23 While the sacrifice was being burned, the priests offered prayer, Jonathan intoning with all the priests,
and the rest responding with Nehemiah.

2Ma 1 :24 The prayer took this form, ‘Lord, Lord God, Creator of all things, awesome, strong, just, merciful, the
only king and benefactor,

2Ma 1 :25 the only provider, who alone are just, almighty and everlasting, the deliverer of Israel from every evil,
who made our fathers your chosen ones and sanctified them,

2Ma 1 :26 accept this sacrifice on behalf of all your people Israel, and protect your heritage and consecrate it.
2Ma 1 .21 Bring together those of us who are dispersed, set free those in slavery among the heathen, look
favourably on those held in contempt or abhorrence, and let the heathen know that you are our God.

2Ma 1 :28 Punish those who oppress us and affront us by their insolence,

2Ma 1 :29 and plant your people firmly in your Holy Place, as Moses promised’.

2Ma 1:30 “The priests then chanted hymns accompanied by the harp.

2Ma 1:31 When the sacrifice had been burnt, Nehemiah ordered the remaining liquid to be poured over large
stones,

2Ma 1 :32 and when this was done a flame flared up, to be absorbed in a corresponding blaze of light from the
altar.

2Ma 1:33 When the matter became known and the king of the Persians heard that, in the place where the exiled
priests had hidden the fire, a liquid had appeared, with which Nehemiah and his people had purified the
sacrificial offerings,

2Ma 1:34 the king, after verifying the facts, had the place enclosed and pronounced sacred.

2Ma 1:35 To the people on whom the king bestowed it, he granted a part of the considerable revenue he
derived from it.

2Ma 1:36 Nehemiah and his people termed this stuff ‘nephtar’, which means ‘purification’, but it is commonly
called ‘naphta’.

2Ma 2:1 “It is on record that the prophet Jeremiah ordered the deportees to take the fire, as we have described,
2Ma 2:2 and how, having given them the Law, the prophet warned the deportees never to forget the Lord’s
precepts, nor to let their thoughts be tempted by the sight of gold and silver statues or the finery adorning them.
2Ma 2:3 Among other similar admonitions, he urged them not to let the Law depart from their hearts.

2Ma 2:4 “The same document also describes how the prophet, warned by an oracle, gave orders for the tent
and the ark to go with him, when he set out for the mountain which Moses had climbed to survey God’s heritage.
2Ma 2:5 On his arrival, Jeremiah found a cave-dwelling, into which he put the tent, the ark and the altar of
incense, afterwards blocking up the entrance.

2Ma 2:6 Some of his companions went back later to mark out the path but were unable to find it.

2Ma 2:7 When Jeremiah learned this, he reproached them, ‘The place is to remain unknown’, he said, ‘until
God gathers his people together again and shows them his mercy.

2Ma 2:8 Then the Lord will bring these things once more to light, and the glory of the Lord will be seen, and so
will the cloud, as it was revealed in the time of Moses and when Solomon prayed that the holy place might be
gloriously hallowed’.

2Ma 2:9 “It was also recorded how Solomon in his wisdom offered the sacrifice of the dedication and completion
of the sanctuary.

2Ma 2:10 As Moses had prayed to the Lord and fire had come down from heaven and burned up the sacrifice,
so Solomon also prayed, and the fire from above consumed the burnt offerings.

2Ma 2:1 1 Moses had said, ‘Because the sacrifice for sin had not been eaten, it was burnt instead’.

2Ma 2:12 Solomon similarly observed the eight-day festival.



2Ma 2:13 “In addition to the above, it was also recorded, both in these writings and in the Memoirs of Nehemiah,
how Nehemiah founded a library and made a collection of the books dealing with the kings and the prophets, the
writings of David and the letters of the kings on the subject of offerings.

2Ma 2:14 Similarly, Judas made a complete collection of the books dispersed in the late war, and these we still
have.

2Ma 2:15 If you need any of them, send someöne to fetch them.

2Ma 2:16 “Since we are about to celebrate the purification, we now write, requesting you to observe the same
days.

2Ma 2:17 God, who has saved his whole people, conferring heritage, kingdom, priesthood and sanctification on
all of us,

2Ma 2:18 as he has promised in the Law, will surely, as our hope is in him, be swift to show us mercy and
gather us together from everywhere under heaven to the holy place, since he has rescued us from great evils
and has purified it”.

2Ma 2:19 The story of Judas Maccabaeus and his brothers, the purification of the great Temple, the dedication
of the altar,

2Ma 2:20 together with the wars against Antiochus Epiphanes and his son Eupator,

2Ma 2:21 and the celestial manifestations that came to hearten the brave champions of Judaism, so that, few
though they were, they pillaged the whole country, routed the barbarian hordes,

2Ma 2:22 recovered the sanctuary renowned the whole world over, liberated the city and reëstablished the laws
by then all but abolished, the Lord showing his favour by all his gracious help to them-

2Ma 2:23 all this, already related in five books by Jason of Cyrene, we shall attempt to condense into a single
work.

2Ma 2:24 Considering the spate of figures and the difficulty encountered, because of the mass of material, by
those who wish to immerse themselves in historical records,

2Ma 2:25 we have aimed at providing diversion for those who merely want something to read, a saving of labour
for those who enjoy committing things to memory, and profit for each and all.

2Ma 2:26 For us who have undertaken the drudgery of this abridgement, it has been no easy task but a matter
of sweat and midnight oil,

2Ma 2:27 comparable to the exacting task of someöne organising a banquet, whose aim is to satisfy a variety of
tastes. Nevertheless, for the sake of rendering a general service, we remain glad to endure this drudgery,

2Ma 2:28 leaving accuracy of detail to the historian, and concentrating our effort on tracing the outlines in this
condensed version.

2Ma 2:29 Just as the architect of a new house is responsible for the construction as a whole, while the man
undertaking the ceramic painting has to take into consideration only the decorative requirements, so, I think, it is
with us.

2Ma 2:30 To make the subject his own, to explore its by-ways, to be meticulous about details, is the business of
the original historian,

2Ma 2:31 but the person making the adaptation must be allowed to aim at conciseness of expression and to
forgo any exhaustive treatment of his subject.

2Ma 2:32 So now let us begin our narrative, without adding any more to what has been said above; there would
be no sense in expanding the preface to the history and curtailing the history itself.

2Ma 3:1 While the holy city was inhabited in all peace and the laws were observed as perfectly as possible,
owing to the piety of Onias the high priest and his hatred of wickedness,

2Ma 3:2 it came about that the kings themselves honoured the holy place and enhanced the glory of the Temple
with the most splendid offerings,

2Ma 3:3 even to the extent that Seleucus king of Asia defrayed from his own revenues all the expenses arising
out of the sacrificial liturgy.

2Ma 3:4 But a certain Simon, of the tribe of Bilgah, on being appointed administrator of the Temple, came into
conflict with the high priest over the regulation of the city markets.

2Ma 3:5 Unable to get the better of Onias, he went off to Apollonius, son of Thraseos, who was at that time
commander-in-chief of Coele-Syria and Phoenicia,

2Ma 3:6 and made out to him that the Treasury in Jerusalem was groaning with untold wealth, that the amount
contributed was incalculable and out of all proportion to expenditure on the sacrifice, but that it could all be
brought under the control of the king.

2Ma 3:7 Apollonius met the king and told him about the wealth that had been disclosed to him; whereüpon the
king selected Heliodorus, his chancellor, and sent him with instructions to effect the removal of the reported
wealth.

2Ma 3:8 Heliodorus lost no time in setting out, ostensibly to inspect the towns of Coele-Syria and Phoenicia, but
in fact to accomplish the king’s purpose.



2Ma 3:9 On his arrival in Jerusalem, and after a hospitable reception from the high priest and the city, he
announced what had been disclosed, thus revealing the reason for his presence, and asked if this was indeed
the true situation.

2Ma 3:10 The high priest explained that there were funds set aside for widows and orphans,

2Ma 3:11 with some belonging to Hyrcanus son of Tobias, a man occupying a very exalted position, and that
the whole sum, in contrast to what the evil Simon had alleged, amounted to four hundred talants of silver and
two hundred of gold.

2Ma 3:12 He also added that it was entirely out of the question that an injustice should be done to those who
had put their trust in the sanctity of the place and in the inviolable majesty of a Temple venerated throughout the
entire world.

2Ma 3:13 But Heliodorus, because of his instructions from the king, peremptorily insisted that the funds must be
confiscated for the royal exchequer.

2Ma 3:14 Fixing a day for the purpose, he went in to draw up an inventory of the funds. There was no little
consternation throughout the city;

2Ma 3:15 the priests in their sacred vestments prostrated themselves before the altar and prayed to Heaven, to
the Author of the law governing deposits, to preserve these funds intact for the depositors.

2Ma 3:16 The appearance of the high priest was enough to pierce the heart of the beholder, his expression and
his altered colour betraying the anguish of his soul;

2Ma 3:17 the man was so overwhelmed by fear and bodily trembling that those who saw him could not possibly
mistake the distress he was suffering.

2Ma 3:18 People rushed headlong from the houses, intent on making public supplication because of the
indignity threatening the holy place.

2Ma 3:19 Women thronged the streets swathed in sackcloth below their breasts; girls secluded indoors came
running, some to the doorways, some to the city walls, while others leaned out of the windows,

2Ma 3:20 all stretching out their hands to Heaven in entreaty.

2Ma 3:21 It was pitiful to see the people crowding together to prostrate themselves, and the foreboding of the
high priest in his deep anguish.

2Ma 3:22 While they were calling on the all-powerful Lord to preserve the deposits intact for the depositors, in
full security,

2Ma 3:23 Heliodorus set about his appointed task.

2Ma 3:24 He had already arrived with his bodyguard near the Treasury, when the Sovereign of spirits and of
every power caused so great an apparition that all who had dared to accompany Heliodorus were dumbfounded
at the power of God and reduced to abject terror.

2Ma 3:25 Before their eyes appeared a horse richly caparisoned and carrying a fearsome rider. Rearing
violently, it struck at Heliodorus with its forefeet. The rider was seen to be accoutred entirely in gold.

2Ma 3:26 Two other young men of outstanding strength and radiant beauty, magnificently apparelled, appeared
to him at the same time and, taking their stand on each side of him, flogged him unremittingly, inflicting stroke
after stroke.

2Ma 3:27 Suddenly Heliodorus fell to the ground, enveloped in thick darkness. His men came to his rescue and
placed him in a litter,

2Ma 3:28 this man who but a moment before had made his way into the Treasury, as we said above, with a
great retinue and his whole bodyguard; and as they carried him away, powerless to help himself, they openly
acknowledged the sovereign power of God.

2Ma 3:29 While Heliodorus lay prostrate under the divine visitation, speechless and bereft of all hope of
deliverance,

2Ma 3:30 the Jews blessed the Lord who had miraculously glorified his own holy place. And the Temple, which
a little while before had been filled with terror and commotion, now overflowed with joy and gladness at the
manifestation of the almighty Lord.

2Ma 3:31 Some of Heliodorus’ companions quickly begged Onias to entreat the Most High to grant the man his
life, lying as he did at the very point of death.

2Ma 3:32 The high priest, afraid that the king might suspect the Jews of some foul play concerning Heliodorus,
did indeed offer a sacrifice for the man’s recovery.

2Ma 3:33 And while the high priest was performing the rite of expiation, the same young men again appeared to
Heliodorus, wearing the same apparel and, standing beside him, said, “Be very grateful to Onias the high priest,
since it is for his sake that the Lord has granted you your life.

2Ma 3:34 As for you, who have been scourged by Heaven, you must proclaim to everyone the grandeur of
God’s power”. So saying, they vanished.

2Ma 3:35 Heliodorus offered sacrifice to the Lord and made most solemn vows to the preserver of his life, and
then took courteous leave of Onias and marched his forces back to the king.



2Ma 3:36 He openly testified to everyone about the works of the supreme God which he had seen with his own
eyes.

2Ma 3:37 When the king asked Heliodorus what sort of man would be the right person to send to Jerusalem on
a second occasion, he replied,

2Ma 3:38 “If you have some enemy or anyone disloyal to the state, send him there, and you will get him back
well flogged, if he survives at all, since some peculiarly divine power attaches to the holy place.

2Ma 3:39 He who has his dwelling in heaven watches over the place and defends it, and he strikes down and
destroys those who come to harm it”.

2Ma 3:40 This was the outcome of the affair of Heliodorus and the preservation of the Treasury.

2Ma 4:1 The Simon mentioned above as the informer against the funds and against his country began
slandering Onias, insinuating that the latter had been responsible for the assault on Heliodorus and himself had
contrived this misfortune.

2Ma 4:2 Simon now had the effrontery to name this benefactor of the city, this protector of his compatriots, this
zealot for the laws, as an enemy of the public good.

2Ma 4:3 This hostility reached such proportions that murders were actually committed by some of Simon’s
agents,

2Ma 4:4 and at this point Onias, recognising how mischievous this rivalry was, and aware that Apollonius son of
Menestheus, the general commanding Coele-Syria and Phoenicia, was encouraging Simon in his malice,

2Ma 4:5 went to see the king, not to play the accuser of his fellow-citizens, but having the public and private
welfare of the entire people at heart.

2Ma 4:6 He saw that, without some intervention by the king, an orderly administration would no longer be
possible, nor would Simon put a stop to his folly.

2Ma 4:7 When Seleucus had departed this life and Antiochus styled Epiphanes had succeeded to the kingdom,
Jason, brother of Onias, usurped the high priesthood:

2Ma 4:8 he approached the king with a promise of three hundred and sixty talants of silver, with eighty talants to
come from some other source of revenue.

2Ma 4:9 He further committed himself to paying another hundred and fifty, if the king would empower him to set
up a gymnasium and youth centre, and to register the Antiochists of Jerusalem.

2Ma 4:10 When the king gave his assent, Jason, as soon as he had seized power, imposed the Greek way of
life on his fellow-countrymen.

2Ma 4:1 1 He suppressed the liberties which the kings had graciously granted to the Jews at the instance of
John, father of that Eupolemus who was later to be sent on an embassy to negotiate a treaty of friendship and
alliance with the Romans and, overthrowing the lawful institutions, introduced new usages contrary to the Law.
2Ma 4:12 He went so far as to found a gymnasium at the very foot of the Citadel, and to fit out the noblest of his
young men in the petasos.

2Ma 4:13 Godless wretch that he was and no true high priest, Jason set no bounds to his impiety; indeed the
hellenising process reached such a pitch

2Ma 4:14 that the priests ceased to show any interest in serving the altar; but, scorning the Temple and
neglecting the sacrifices, they would hurry, on the stroke of the gong, to take part in the distribution, forbidden by
the Law, of the oil on the exercise ground;

2Ma 4:15 setting no store by the honours of their fatherland, they esteemed hellenic glories best of all.

2Ma 4:16 But all this brought its own retribution; the very people whose way of life they envied, whom they
sought to resemble in everything, proved to be their enemies and executioners.

2Ma 4:17 It is no small thing to violate the divine laws, as the period that followed will demonstrate.

2Ma 4:18 On the occasion of the quadrennial games at Tyre in the presence of the king,

2Ma 4:19 the vile Jason sent an embassy of Antiochists from Jerusalem, taking with them three hundred silver
drachmas for the sacrifice to Hercules. But even those who brought the money did not think it would be right to
spend it on the sacrifice and decided to reserve it for some other item of expenditure;

2Ma 4:20 and so what the sender had intended for the sacrifice to Hercules was in fact applied, at the
suggestion of those who brought it, to the construction of triremes.

2Ma 4:21 Apollonius son of Menestheus had been sent to Egypt to attend the wedding of King Philometor.
Antiochus, having learnt that the latter had become hostile to his affairs, began thinking about his own safety:
that was why he had come to Joppa. He then moved to Jerusalem,

2Ma 4:22 where he was given a magnificent welcome by Jason and the city, and escorted in by torchlight with
acclamation. After which, he marched his army into Phoenicia.

2Ma 4:23 When three years had passed, Jason sent Menelaus, brother of the Simon mentioned above, to
convey the money to the king and to complete negotiations on various essential matters.

2Ma 4:24 But Menelaus, on being presented to the king, flattered him by his own appearance of authority, and
so secured the high priesthood for himself, outbidding Jason by three hundred talants of silver.



2Ma 4:25 He returned with the royal mandate, bringing nothing worthy of the high priesthood and supported
only by the fury of a cruel tyrant and the rage of a savage beast.

2Ma 4:26 Thus Jason, who had supplanted his own brother, was in turn supplanted by a third, and obliged to
take refuge in Ammanitis.

2Ma 4:27 As for Menelaus, he secured the office, but defaulted altogether on the sums promised to the king,
2Ma 4:28 although Sostratus, the commandant of the Citadel, whose business it was to collect the revenue,
kept demanding payment. The pair of them in consequence were summoned before the king,

2Ma 4:29 Menelaus leaving his brother Lysimachus as deputy high priest, while Sostratus left Crates, the
commander of the Cypriots, to act for him.

2Ma 4:30 While all this was going on, it happened that the people of Tarsus and Mallus revolted, because their
towns had been given as a present to Antiochis, the king’s concubine.

2Ma 4:31 The king therefore hurried off to settle the affair, leaving Andronicus, one of his dignitaries, to act as
his deputy.

2Ma 4:32 Thinking he had found a favourable opportunity, Menelaus abstracted a number of golden vessels
from the Temple and presented them to Andronicus, and managed to sell others to Tyre and the surrounding
cities.

2Ma 4:33 On receiving clear evidence to this effect, Onias retired to a place of sanctuary at Daphne near
Antioch and then taxed him with it.

2Ma 4:34 Menelaus then had a quiet word with Andronicus, urging him to get rid of Onias. Andronicus sought
out Onias and, resorting to the trick of offering him his right hand on oath, succeeded in persuading him, despite
the latter’s lingering suspicions, to leave sanctuary; whereüpon, in defiance of all justice, he immediately put him
to death.

2Ma 4:35 The result was that not only Jews but many people of other nationalities were appalled and outraged
by the unjust murder of this man.

2Ma 4:36 On the king’s return from the region of Cilicia, the Jews of the capital, and those Greeks who shared
their hatred of the crime, appealed to him about the unjustified murder of Onias.

2Ma 4:37 Antiochus was profoundly grieved and filled with pity, and he wept for the prudence and moderation of
the dead man.

2Ma 4:38 Burning with indignation, he immediately stripped Andronicus of the purple, tore his garments off him
and, parading him through the length of the city, rid the world of the assassin on the very spot where he had laid
impious hands on Onias, the Lord dealing out to him the punishment he deserved.

2Ma 4:39 Now Lysimachus with the connivance of Menelaus had committed many sacrilegious thefts in the city,
and when the facts became widely known, the populace rose against Lysimachus, who had already disposed of
many pieces of gold plate.

2Ma 4:40 The infuriated mob was becoming menacing, and Lysimachus armed nearly three thousand men and
took aggressive action; the troops were led by a certain Auranus, a man advanced in years and no less in folly.
2Ma 4:41 Recognising this act of aggression as the work of Lysimachus, some snatched up stones, others
cudgels, while others scooped up handfuls of ashes lying at hand, and all hurled everything indiscriminately at
Lysimachus’ men,

2Ma 4:42 to such effect that they wounded many of them, even killing a few, and routed them all; the
sacrilegious thief himself they killed near the Treasury.

2Ma 4:43 As a result of this, legal proceedings were taken against Menelaus.

2Ma 4:44 When the king came down to Tyre, three men deputed by the Senate pleaded their case before him.
2Ma 4:45 Menelaus, seeing the case had gone against him, promised a substantial sum to Ptolemy son of
Dorymenes if he would influence the king in his favour.

2Ma 4:46 Ptolemy then took the king aside into a colonnade, as though for a breath of fresh air, and persuaded
him to change his mind;

2Ma 4:47 the king then dismissed the charges against Menelaus, the cause of all this evil, while he condemned
to death the other poor wretches who, had they pleaded even before Scythians, would have been let off scot-
free.

2Ma 4:48 No time was lost in carrying out this unjust punishment on those who had championed the cause of
the city, the townships and the sacred vessels.

2Ma 4:49 Some Tyrians even were so outraged by the crime that they provided sumptuously for their funeral,
2Ma 4:50 while, as a result of the greed of the powerful, Menelaus remained in power, growing more wicked
than ever and establishing himself as the chief enemy of his fellow-citizens.

2Ma 5:1 At about this time, Antiochus was preparing for his second attack on Egypt.

2Ma 5:2 It then happened that all over the city for nearly forty days there were apparitions of horsemen
galloping through the air in cloth of gold, troops of lancers fully armed,

2Ma 5:3 squadrons of cavalry in order of battle, attacks and charges this way and that, a flourish of shields, a



forest of pikes, a brandishing of swords, a hurling of missiles, a glittering of golden accoutrements and armour of
all kinds.

2Ma 5:4 So everyone prayed that this manifestation might prove a good omen.

2Ma 5:5 Then, on the strength of a false report that Antiochus was dead, Jason took at least a thousand men
and launched an unexpected attack on the city. When the walls had been breached and the city was finally on
the point of being taken, Menelaus took refuge in the Citadel.

2Ma 5:6 Jason, however, made a pitiless slaughter of his fellow-citizens, oblivious of the fact that success
against his own countrymen was the greatest of disasters, but rather picturing himself as winning trophies from
some enemy, and not from his fellow- countrymen.

2Ma 5:7 Even so, he did not manage to seize power; and, in the end, his machinations brought him nothing but
shame, and he took refuge once more in Ammanitis.

2Ma 5:8 His career of wickedness was thus brought to a halt: imprisoned by Aretas, the Arab despot, escaping
from his town, hunted by everyone, detested for having overthrown the laws, abhorred as the butcher of his
country and his countrymen, he drifted to Egypt.

2Ma 5:9 He who had exiled so many from their fatherland, himself perished on foreign soil, having travelled to
Sparta, hoping that, for kinship’s sake, he might find harbour there.

2Ma 5:10 So many carcases he had thrust out to lie unburied; now he himself had none to mourn him, no
funeral rites, no place in the tomb of his ancestors.

2Ma 5:1 1 When the king came to hear of what had happened, he concluded that Judaea was in revolt. He
therefore marched from Egypt, raging like a wild beast, and began by storming the city.

2Ma 5:12 He then ordered his soldiers to cut down without mercy everyone they encountered, and to butcher all
who took refuge in their houses.

2Ma 5:13 It was a massacre of young and old, a slaughter of women and children, a butchery of young girls and
infants.

2Ma 5:14 There were eighty thousand victims in the course of those three days, forty thousand dying by
violence and as many again being sold into slavery.

2Ma 5:15 Not content with this, he had the audacity to enter the holiest Temple in the entire world, with
Menelaus, that traitor to the laws and to his country, as his guide;

2Ma 5:16 with impure hands he seized the sacred vessels; with impious hands he seized the offerings
presented by other kings for the aggrandisement, glory and dignity of the holy place.

2Ma 5:17 Holding so high an opinion of himself, Antiochus did not realise that the Lord was temporarily angry at
the sins of the inhabitants of the city, hence his unconcern for the holy place.

2Ma 5:18 Had they not been entangled in many sins, Antiochus too, like Heliodorus when King Seleucus sent
him to inspect the Treasury, would have been flogged the moment he arrived and checked in his presumption.
2Ma 5:19 The Lord, however, had not chosen the people for the sake of the holy place, but the holy place for
the sake of the people;

2Ma 5:20 and so the holy place itself, having shared the disasters that befell the people, in due course also
shared their good fortune; having been abandoned by the Almighty in his anger, once the great Sovereign was
placated it was reinstated in all its glory.

2Ma 5:21 Antiochus, having extracted eighteen hundred talants from the Temple, hurried back to Antioch; in his
pride he would have undertaken to make the dry land navigable and the sea passable on foot, so high his
arrogance soared.

2Ma 5:22 But he left officials behind to plague the nation: in Jerusalem, Philip, a Phrygian by race, and by
nature more barbarous than the man who appointed him;

2Ma 5:23 on Mount Gerizim, Andronicus; and, besides these, Menelaus, who lorded it over his countrymen
worse than all the others. In his rooted hostility to the Jews,

2Ma 5:24 the king also sent the Mysarch Apollonius at the head of an army twenty-two thousand strong, with
orders to put to death all men in their prime and to sell the women and children.

2Ma 5:25 Arriving in Jerusalem and posing as a man of peace, this man waited until the holy day of the Sabbath
and then, taking advantage of the Jews as they rested from work, ordered his men to parade fully armed;

2Ma 5:26 all those who came out to watch he put to the sword; then, rushing into the city with his armed troops,
he cut down an immense number of people.

2Ma 5:27 Judas, also known as Maccabaeus, however, with about nine others, withdrew into the desert. He
lived like the wild animals in the hills with his companions, eating nothing but wild plants to avoid contracting
defilement.

2Ma 6:1 Shortly afterwards, the king sent Gerontes the Athenian to force the Jews to violate their ancestral
customs and live no longer by the laws of God;

2Ma 6:2 and to profane the Temple in Jerusalem and dedicate it to Olympian Zeus, and the one on Mount
Gerizim to Zeus, Patron of Strangers, as the inhabitants of the latter place had requested.



2Ma 6:3 The advent of these evils was painfully hard for all the people to bear.

2Ma 6:4 The Temple was filled with revelling and debauchery by the gentiles, who took their pleasure with
prostitutes and had intercourse with women in the sacred precincts, introducing other indecencies besides.

2Ma 6:5 The altar of sacrifice was loaded with victims proscribed by the law as profane.

2Ma 6:6 No one might either keep the Sabbath or observe the traditional feasts, or so much as admit to being a
Jew.

2Ma 6:7 People were driven by harsh compulsion to take part in the monthly ritual meal commemorating the
king’s birthday; and when a feast of Dionysus occurred, they were forced to wear ivy wreaths and walk in the
Dionysiac procession.

2Ma 6:8 A decree was issued at the instance of the people of Ptolemais for the neighbouring Greek cities,
enforcing the same conduct on the Jews there, obliging them to share in the sacrificial meals,

2Ma 6:9 and ordering the execution of those who would not voluntarily conform to Greek customs. So it became
clear that disaster was imminent.

2Ma 6:10 For example, two women were charged with having circumcised their children. They were paraded
publicly round the town, with their babies hung at their breasts, and then hurled over the city wall.

2Ma 6:1 1 Other people, who had assembled in some near-by caves to keep the seventh day without attracting
attention, were denounced to Philip, and were then all burnt to death together, since their consciences would not
allow them to defend themselves, out of respect for the holiness of the day.

2Ma 6:12 Now, I urge anyone who may read this book not to be dismayed at these calamities, but to reflect that
such visitations are intended not to destroy our race but to discipline it.

2Ma 6:13 Indeed, when evil-doers are not left for long to their own devices but incur swift retribution, it is a sign
of great benevolence.

2Ma 6:14 In the case of other nations, the Master waits patiently for them to attain the full measure of their sins
before he punishes them, but with us he has decided to deal differently,

2Ma 6:15 rather than have to punish us later, when our sins come to full measure.

2Ma 6:16 And so he never entirely withdraws his mercy from us; he may discipline us by some disaster, but he
does not desert his own people.

2Ma 6:17 Let this be said simply by way of reminder; we must return to our story without more ado.

2Ma 6:18 Eleazar, one of the foremost teachers of the Law, a man already advanced in years and of most noble
appearance, had his mouth forced open, to make him eat a piece of pork.

2Ma 6:19 But he, resolving to die with honour rather than to live disgraced, walked of his own accord to the
torture of the wheel,

2Ma 6:20 having spat the stuff out, as befits those with the courage to reject what is not lawful to taste, rather
than live.

2Ma 6:21 The people supervising the ritual meal, forbidden by the Law, because of the length of time for which
they had known him, took him aside and privately urged him to have meat brought of a kind he could properly
use, prepared by himself, and only pretend to eat the portions of sacrificial meat as prescribed by the king;

2Ma 6:22 this action would enable him to escape death, by availing himself of an act of kindness prompted by
their long friendship.

2Ma 6:23 But having taken a noble decision worthy of his years and the dignity of his great age and the well-
earned distinction of his grey hairs, worthy too of his impeccable conduct from boyhood, and above all of the
holy legislation established by God himself, he answered accordingly, telling them to send him at once to Hades.
2Ma 6:24 “Pretence”, he said, “does not befit our time of life; many young people would suppose that Eleazar at
the age of ninety had conformed to the foreigners’ way of life

2Ma 6:25 and, because I had played this part for the sake of a paltry brief spell of life, might themselves be led
astray on my account; I should only bring defilement and disgrace on my old age.

2Ma 6:26 Even though for the moment I avoid execution by man, I can never, living or dead, elude the grasp of
the Almighty.

2Ma 6:27 Therefore if I am man enough to quit this life here and now, I shall prove myself worthy of my old age,
2Ma 6:28 and I shall have left the young a noble example of how to make a good death, eagerly and
generously, for the venerable and holy laws”. So saying, he walked straight to the wheel,

2Ma 6:29 while those who were escorting him, recently so well disposed towards him, turned against him after
this declaration, which they regarded as sheer madness.

2Ma 6:30 He for his part, just before he died under the blows, gave a sigh and said, “The Lord whose knowledge
is holy sees clearly that, though I might have escaped death, from awe of him I gladly endure these agonies of
body under the lash, and that in my soul I am glad to suffer”.

2Ma 6:31 This was how he died, leaving his death as an example of nobility and a record of virtue not only for
the young but for the greater part of the nation.

2Ma 7:1 It also happened that seven brothers were arrested with their mother. The king tried to force them to



taste some pork, which the Law forbids, by torturing them with whips and scourges.

2Ma 7:2 One of them, acting as spokesman for the others, said, “What are you trying to find out from us? We
are prepared to die rather than break the laws of our ancestors”.

2Ma 7:3 The king, in a fury, ordered pans and cauldrons to be heated over a fire.

2Ma 7:4 As soon as these were red-hot, he commanded that their spokesman should have his tongue cut out,
his head scalped and his extremities cut off, while the other brothers and his mother looked on.

2Ma 7:5 When he had been rendered completely helpless, the king gave orders for him to be brought, still
breathing, to the fire and fried alive in a pan. As the smoke from the pan drifted about, his mother and the rest
encouraged one another to die nobly, with such words as these,

2Ma 7:6 “The Lord God is watching and certainly feels sorry for us, as Moses declared in his song, which clearly
states that ‘he will take pity on his servants’”.

2Ma 7:7 When the first had left the world in this way, they brought the second forward to be tortured. After
stripping the skin from his head, hair and all, they asked him, “Will you eat some pork, before your body is
tortured limb by limb?”.

2Ma 7:8 Replying in his ancestral tongue, he said, “No!”. So he too was put to the torture in his turn.

2Ma 7:9 With his last breath he exclaimed, “Cruel brute, you may discharge us from this present life, but the
King of the world will raise us up, since we die for his laws, to live again for ever”.

2Ma 7:10 After him, they tortured the third, who on being asked for his tongue promptly thrust it out and boldly
held out his hands,

2Ma 7:1 1 courageously saying, “Heaven gave me these limbs; for the sake of his laws I have no concern for
them; from him I hope to receive them again”.

2Ma 7:12 The king and his attendants were astounded at the young man’s courage and his utter indifference to
suffering.

2Ma 7:13 When this one was dead they subjected the fourth to the same torments and tortures.

2Ma 7:14 When he neared his end he cried, “Ours is the better choice, to meet death at men’s hands, yet relying
on God’s promise that we shall be raised up by him; whereäs for you there can be no resurrection to new life”.
2Ma 7:15 Next they brought forward the fifth and began torturing him.

2Ma 7:16 But he looked at the king and said, “You have power over human beings, mortal as you are, and can
act as you please. But do not think that our race has been deserted by God.

2Ma 7:17 Only wait, and you will see in your turn how his mighty power will torment you and your descendants”.
2Ma 7:18 After him, they led out the sixth, and his dying words were these, “Do not delude yourself: we are
suffering like this through our own fault, having sinned against our own God; hence, appalling things have
befallen us-

2Ma 7:19 but do not think you yourself will go unpunished for attempting to make war on God”.

2Ma 7:20 But the mother was especially admirable and worthy of honourable remembrance, for she watched
the death of seven sons in the course of a single day, and bravely endured it because of her hopes in the Lord.
2Ma 7:21 Indeed she encouraged each of them in their ancestral tongue; filled with noble conviction, she
reïnforced her womanly argument with manly courage, saying to them,

2Ma 7:22 “I do not know how you appeared in my womb; it was not I who endowed you with breath and life, I
had not the shaping of your every part.

2Ma 7:23 And hence, the Creator of the world, who made everyone and ordained the origin of all things, will in
his mercy give you back breath and life, since for the sake of his laws you have no concern for yourselves”.

2Ma 7:24 Antiochus thought he was being ridiculed, suspecting insult in the tone of her voice; and as the
youngest was still alive he appealed to him not with mere words but with promises on oath to make him both rich
and happy if he would abandon the traditions of his ancestors; he would make him his Friend and entrust him
with public office.

2Ma 7:25 The young man took no notice at all, and so the king then appealed to the mother, urging her to
advise the youth to save his life.

2Ma 7:26 After a great deal of urging on his part she agreed to try persuasion on her son.

2Ma 7:27 Bending over him, she fooled the cruel tyrant with these words, uttered in their ancestral tongue, “My
son, have pity on me; I carried you nine months in my womb and suckled you three years, fed you and reared
you to the age you are now, and provided for you.

2Ma 7:28 I implore you, my child, look at the earth and sky and everything in them, and consider how God made
them out of what did not exist, and that human beings come into being in the same way.

2Ma 7:29 Do not fear this executioner, but prove yourself worthy of your brothers and accept death, so that I
may receive you back with them in the day of mercy”.

2Ma 7:30 She had hardly finished, when the young man said, “What are you all waiting for? I will not comply
with the king’s ordinance; I obey the ordinance of the Law given to our ancestors through Moses.

2Ma 7:31 As for you, who have contrived every kind of evil against the Hebrews, you will certainly not escape



the hands of God.

2Ma 7:32 We are suffering for our own sins;

2Ma 7:33 and if, to punish and discipline us, our living Lord is briefly angry with us, he will be reconciled with us
in due course.

2Ma 7:34 But you, unholy wretch and wickedest of villains, what cause have you for pride, nourishing vain
hopes and raising your hand against his servants? -

2Ma 7:35 for you have not yet escaped the judgement of God the almighty, the all-seeing.

2Ma 7:36 Our brothers, having endured brief pain, for the sake of ever-flowing life have died for the covenant of
God, while you, by God’s judgement, will have to pay the just penalty for your arrogance.

2Ma 7:37 I too, like my brothers, surrender my body and life for the laws of my ancestors, begging God quickly
to take pity on our nation, and by trials and afflictions to bring you to confess that he alone is God,

2Ma 7:38 so that with my brothers and myself there may be an end to the wrath of the Almighty, rightly let loose
on our whole nation”.

2Ma 7:39 The king fell into a rage and treated this one more cruelly than the others, for he was himself smarting
from the young man’s scorn.

2Ma 7:40 And so the last brother met his end undefiled and with perfect trust in the Lord.

2Ma 7:41 The mother was the last to die, after her sons.

2Ma 7:42 But let this be sufficient account of the ritual meals and monstrous tortures.

2Ma 8:1 Judas, otherwise known as Maccabaeus, and his companions made their way secretly among the
villages, rallying their fellow-countrymen; they recruited those who remained loyal to Judaism and assembled
about six thousand.

2Ma 8:2 They called on the Lord to have regard for the people oppressed on all sides, to take pity on the
Temple profaned by the godless,

2Ma 8:3 to have mercy on the city now being destroyed and levelled to the ground, to hear the blood of the
victims that cried aloud to him,

2Ma 8:4 to remember too the criminal slaughter of innocent babies and to avenge the blasphemies perpetrated
against his name.

2Ma 8:5 As soon as Maccabaeus had an organised force, he at once proved invincible to the foreigners, the
Lord’s anger having turned into compassion.

2Ma 8:6 Making surprise attacks on towns and villages, he fired them; he captured favourable positions and
inflicted very heavy losses on the enemy,

2Ma 8:7 generally availing himself of the cover of night for such enterprises. The fame of his valour spread far
and wide.

2Ma 8:8 When Philip saw Judas was making steady progress and winning more and more frequent successes,
he wrote to Ptolemy, the general officer commanding Coele-Syria and Phoenicia, asking for reinforcements in
the royal interest.

2Ma 8:9 Ptolemy chose Nicanor son of Patroclus, one of the king’s First Friends, and sent him without delay at
the head of an international force of at least twenty thousand men to exterminate the entire Jewish race. As his
associate he appointed Gorgias, a professional general of wide military experience.

2Ma 8:10 Nicanor for his part proposed, by the sale of Jewish prisoners of war, to raise the two thousand talants
of tribute money owed by the king to the Romans.

2Ma 8:1 1 He lost no time in sending the seaboard towns an invitation to come and buy Jewish manpower,
promising delivery of ninety head for one talant; but he did not reckon on the judgement from the Almighty that
was soon to overtake him.

2Ma 8:12 When news reached Judas of Nicanor’s advance, he warned his men of the enemy’s approach,

2Ma 8:13 whereüpon the cowardly ones and those who lacked confidence in the justice of God took to their
heels and ran away.

2Ma 8:14 The rest sold all their remaining possessions, at the same time praying the Lord to deliver them from
the godless Nicanor, who had sold them even in advance of any encounter-

2Ma 8:15 if not for their own sakes, then at least out of consideration for the covenants made with their
ancestors, and because they themselves bore his sacred and majestic name.

2Ma 8:16 Maccabaeus marshalled his men, who numbered about six thousand, and exhorted them not to be
dismayed at the enemy or discouraged at the vast horde of gentiles wickedly advancing against them, but to
fight bravely,

2Ma 8:17 keeping before their eyes the outrage committed by them against the holy place and the infamous and
scornful treatment inflicted on the city, not to mention the destruction of their traditional way of life.

2Ma 8:18 “They may put their trust in their weapons and their exploits”, he said, “but our confidence is in almighty
God, who is able with a single nod to overthrow both those marching on us and the whole world with them”.

2Ma 8:19 He reminded them of the occasions on which their ancestors had received help: that time when, under



Sennacherib, a hundred and eighty-five thousand men had perished;

2Ma 8:20 that time in Babylonia when in the battle with the Galatians the Jewish combatants numbered only
eight thousand, with four thousand Macedonians, yet when the Macedonians were hard pressed, the eight
thousand had destroyed a hundred and twenty thousand, thanks to the help they had received from Heaven, and
had taken great booty as a result.

2Ma 8:21 Having so roused their courage by these words that they were ready to die for the laws and their
country, he then divided his army into four,

2Ma 8:22 putting his brothers, Simon, Joseph and Jonathan in command of one division each, and assigning
them fifteen hundred men apiece.

2Ma 8:23 Next, he ordered Esdrias to read the Holy Book aloud and gave them their watchword ‘Help from
God’. Then, putting himself at the head of the first division, he attacked Nicanor.

2Ma 8:24 With the Almighty for their ally they slaughtered over nine thousand of the enemy, wounded and
crippled the greater part of Nicanor’s army and put them all to flight.

2Ma 8:25 The money of their prospective purchasers fell into their hands. After pursuing them for a good while,
they turned back, since time was pressing:

2Ma 8:26 it was the eve of the Sabbath, and for that reason they did not prolong their pursuit.

2Ma 8:27 They collected the enemy’s weapons and stripped them of their spoils, and because of the Sabbath
even more heartily blessed and praised the Lord, who had saved them and who had chosen that day for the first
manifestation of his compassion.

2Ma 8:28 When the Sabbath was over, they distributed some of the booty among the victims of the persecution
and the widows and orphans; the rest they divided among themselves and their children.

2Ma 8:29 They then joined in public supplication, imploring the merciful Lord to be fully reconciled with his
servants.

2Ma 8:30 They also challenged the forces of Timotheus and Bacchides and destroyed over twenty thousand of
them, gaining possession of several high fortresses. They divided their enormous booty into two equal shares,
one for themselves, the other for the victims of the persecution and the orphans and widows, not forgetting the
aged.

2Ma 8:31 They carefully collected the enemy’s weapons and stored them in suitable places. The rest of the
spoils they took to Jerusalem.

2Ma 8:32 They killed the tribal chieftain on Timotheus’ staff, an extremely wicked man who had done great harm
to the Jews.

2Ma 8:33 In the course of their victory celebrations in Jerusalem, they burned the men who had fired the Holy
Gates; with Callisthenes they had taken refuge in one small house; so these received a fitting reward for their
sacrilege.

2Ma 8:34 The triple-dyed scoundrel Nicanor, who had brought the thousand merchants to buy the Jews,

2Ma 8:35 finding himself with the Lord’s help humbled by men he had himself reckoned as of very little account,
stripped off his robes of state, and made his way across country unaccompanied, like a runaway slave, reaching
Antioch by a singular stroke of fortune, since his army had been destroyed.

2Ma 8:36 Thus the man who had promised the Romans to make good their tribute money by selling the
prisoners from Jerusalem, bore witness that the Jews had a defender and that they were in consequence
invulnerable, since they followed the laws which that defender had ordained.

2Ma 9:1 At about the same time, Antiochus was beating a disorderly retreat from Persia.

2Ma 9:2 He had entered the city called Persepolis, planning to rob the temple and occupy the city; but the
population at once sprang to arms to defend themselves, with the result that Antiochus was routed by the
inhabitants and forced to beat a humiliating retreat.

2Ma 9:3 On his arrival in Ecbatana he learned what had happened to Nicanor and to Timotheus’ forces.

2Ma 9:4 Flying into a passion, he resolved to make the Jews pay for the disgrace inflicted by those who had
routed him, and with this in mind he ordered his charioteer to drive without stopping and get the journey over.

But the sentence of Heaven was already hanging over him. In his pride, he had said, “When I reach Jerusalem, I
shall turn it into a mass grave for the Jews”.

2Ma 9:5 But the all-seeing Lord, the God of Israel, struck him with an incurable and unseen complaint. The
words were hardly out of his mouth when he was seized with an incurable pain in his bowels and with
excruciating internal torture;

2Ma 9:6 and this was only right, since he had inflicted many barbaric tortures on the bowels of others.

2Ma 9:7 Even so, he in no way diminished his arrogance; still bursting with pride, breathing fire in his wrath
against the Jews, he was in the act of ordering an even keener pace when the chariot gave a sudden lurch and
out he fell and, in this serious fall, was dragged along, every joint of his body wrenched out of place.

2Ma 9:8 He who only a little while before had thought in his superhuman boastfulness he could command the
waves of the sea, he who had imagined he could weigh mountain peaks in a balance, found himself flat on the



ground and then being carried in a litter, a visible demonstration to all of the power of God,

2Ma 9:9 in that the very eyes of this godless man teemed with worms and his flesh rotted away while he
lingered on in agonising pain, and the stench of his decay sickened the whole army.

2Ma 9:10 A short while before, he had thought to grasp the stars of heaven; now no one could bring himself to
act as his bearer, for the stench was intolerable.

2Ma 9:1 1 Then and there, as a consequence, in his shattered state, he began to shed his excessive pride and
come to his senses under the divine lash, spasms of pain overtaking him.

2Ma 9:12 His stench being unbearable even to himself, he exclaimed, “It is right to submit to God; no mortal
should aspire to equality with the Godhead”.

2Ma 9:13 The wretch began to pray to the Master, who would never take pity on him now, declaring

2Ma 9:14 that the holy city, towards which he had been speeding to rase it to the ground and turn it into a mass

grave, should be declared free;

2Ma 9:15 as for the Jews, whom he had considered as not even worth burying, so much carrion to be thrown
out with their children for birds and beasts to prey on, he would give them all equal rights with the Athenians;

2Ma 9:16 the holy Temple which he had once plundered he would now adorn with the finest offerings; he would
restore all the sacred vessels many times over; he would defray from his personal revenue the expenses
incurred for the sacrifices;

2Ma 9:17 and, to crown all, he would himself turn Jew and visit every inhabited place, proclaiming the power of
God.

2Ma 9:18 Finding no respite at all from his suffering, God’s just sentence having overtaken him, he abandoned
all hope for himself and wrote the Jews the letter transcribed below, which takes the form of an appeal in these
terms:

2Ma 9:19 “To the excellent Jews, to the citizens, Antiochus, king and commander-in-chief, sends hearty
greetings, wishing them all health and prosperity.

2Ma 9:20 “If you and your children are well and your affairs as you would wish, we are profoundly thankful.

2Ma 9:21 For my part, I cherish affectionate memories of you. “On my return from the country of Persia I fell
seriously ill, and thought it necessary to make provision for the common security of all.

2Ma 9:22 Not that I despair of my condition, for I have great hope of shaking off the malady,

2Ma 9:23 but considering how my father, whenever he was making an expedition into the uplands, would
designate his successor

2Ma 9:24 so that, in case of any unforeseen event or disquieting rumour, the people of the provinces might
know to whom he had left the conduct of affairs, and thus remain undisturbed;

2Ma 9:25 furthermore, being well aware that the sovereigns on our frontiers and the neighbours of our realm are
watching for opportunities and waiting to see what will happen, I have designated as king my son Antiochus,
whom I have more than once entrusted and commended to most of you when I was setting out for the upland
satrapies; a transcript of my letter to him is appended hereto.

2Ma 9:26 I therefore urge and require you, being mindful of the benefits both public and personal received from
me, that you each persist in those sentiments of goodwill that you harbour towards me.

2Ma 9:27 I am confident that he will pursue my own policy with benevolence and humanity, and will prove
accommodating to your interests”.

2Ma 9:28 And so this murderer and blasphemer, having endured sufferings as terrible as those which he had
made others endure, met his pitiable fate, and ended his life in the mountains far from his home.

2Ma 9:29 His comrade Philip brought back his body, and then, fearing Antiochus’ son, withdrew to Egypt, to the
court of Ptolemy Philometor.

2Ma 10:1 Maccabaeus and his companions, under the Lord’s guidance, restored the Temple and the city,

2Ma 10:2 and pulled down the altars erected by the foreigners in the market place, as well as the shrines.

2Ma 10:3 They purified the sanctuary and built another altar; then, striking fire from flints and using this fire, they
offered the first sacrifice for two years, burning incense, lighting the lamps and setting out the loaves.

2Ma 10:4 When they had done this, prostrating themselves on the ground, they implored the Lord never again
to let them fall into such adversity, but if they should ever sin, to correct them with moderation and not to deliver
them over to blasphemous and barbarous nations.

2Ma 10:5 This day of the purification of the Temple fell on the very day on which the Temple had been profaned
by the foreigners, the twenty-fifth of the same month, Chislev.

2Ma 1 0:6 They kept eight festal days with rejoicing, in the manner of the feast of Shelters, remembering how,
not long before at the time of the feast of Shelters, they had been living in the mountains and caverns like wild
beasts.

2Ma 10:7 Then, carrying thyrsuses, leafy boughs and palms, they offered hymns to him who had brought the
cleansing of his own holy place to a happy outcome.

2Ma 10:8 They also decreed by public edict, ratified by vote, that the whole Jewish nation should celebrate



those same days every year.

2Ma 10:9 Such were the circumstances attending the death of Antiochus styled Epiphanes.

2Ma 10:10 Our task now is to unfold the history of Antiochus Eupator, son of that godless man, and briefly to
relate the evil effects of the wars.

2Ma 10:1 1 On coming to the throne, this prince put at the head of affairs a certain Lysias, the general officer
commanding Coele-Syria and Phoenicia,

2Ma 10:12 whereäs Ptolemy, known as Macron, and the first person to govern the Jews justly, had done his
best to govern them peacefully to make up for the wrongs inflicted on them in the past.

2Ma 10:13 Denounced, in consequence, to Eupator by the Friends of the King, he heard himself called traitor at
every turn: for having abandoned Cyprus, which had been entrusted to him by Philometer, for having gone over
to Antiochus Epiphanes, and for having shed no lustre on his illustrious office: he committed suicide by poisoning
himself.

2Ma 10:14 Gorgias now became general of the area; he maintained a force of mercenaries and a continual
state of war with the Jews.

2Ma 10:15 At the same time, the Idumaeans, who controlled important fortresses, were harassing the Jews,
welcoming outlaws from Jerusalem and endeavouring to maintain a state of war.

2Ma 10:16 Maccabaeus and his men, after making public supplication to God, entreating him to support them,
began operations against the Idumaean fortresses.

2Ma 10:17 Vigorously pressing home their attack, they seized possession of these vantage points, beating off
all who fought on the ramparts; they slaughtered all who fell into their hands, accounting for no fewer than twenty
thousand.

2Ma 10:18 Nine thousand at least took refuge in two exceptionally strong towers with everything they needed to
withstand a siege,

2Ma 10:19 whereüpon, Maccabaeus left Simon and Joseph, with Zacchaeus and his forces, in sufficient
numbers to besiege them, and himself went off to other places requiring his attention.

2Ma 10:20 But Simon’s men were greedy for money and allowed themselves to be bribed by some of the men
in the towers; accepting seventy thousand drachmas, they let a number of them escape.

2Ma 10:21 When Maccabaeus was told what had happened, he summoned the people’s commanders and
accused the offenders of having sold their brothers for money by releasing their enemies to fight them.

2Ma 10:22 Having executed them as traitors, he at once proceeded to capture both towers.

2Ma 10:23 Successful in all that he undertook by force of arms, in these two fortresses he slaughtered more
than twenty thousand men.

2Ma 10:24 Timotheus, who had been beaten by the Jews once before, now assembled an enormous force of
mercenaries, mustering cavalry from Asia in considerable numbers, and soon appeared in Judaea, expecting to
conquer it by force of arms.

2Ma 10:25 At his approach, Maccabaeus and his men made their supplications to God, sprinkling earth on their
heads and putting sackcloth round their waists.

2Ma 10:26 Prostrating themselves on the terrace before the altar, they begged him to support them and to show
himself the enemy of their enemies, the adversary of their adversaries, as the Law clearly states.

2Ma 10:27 After these prayers, they armed themselves and advanced a fair distance from the city, halting when
they were close to the enemy.

2Ma 1 0:28 As the first light of dawn began to spread, the two sides joined battle, the one having as their pledge
of success and victory not only their own valour but their recourse to the Lord, the other making their own ardour
their mainstay in the fight.

2Ma 10:29 When the battle was at its height, the enemy saw five magnificent men appear from heaven on
horses with golden bridles and put themselves at the head of the Jews;

2Ma 10:30 surrounding Maccabaeus and screening him with their own armour, they kept him unscathed, while
they rained arrows and thunderbolts on the enemy until, blinded and confused, they scattered in complete
disorder.

2Ma 10:31 Twenty thousand five hundred infantry and six hundred cavalry were slaughtered.

2Ma 10:32 Timotheus himself fled to a strongly guarded citadel called Gezer, where Chaereas was in
command.

2Ma 1 0:33 For four days Maccabaeus and his men eagerly besieged the fortress,

2Ma 10:34 while the defenders, confident in the security of the place, hurled fearful blasphemies and godless
insults at them.

2Ma 10:35 At daybreak on the fifth day, twenty young men of Maccabaeus’ forces, fired with indignation at the
blasphemies, manfully assaulted the wall, with wild courage cutting down everyone they encountered.

2Ma 1 0:36 Others, in a similar scaling operation, took the defenders in the rear, and set fire to the towers,
lighting pyres on which they burned the blasphemers alive. The first, meanwhile, breaking open the gates, let the



rest of the army in and, at their head, captured the town.

2Ma 10:37 Timotheus had hidden in a storage-well, but they killed him, with his brother Chaereas, and
Apollophanes.

2Ma 10:38 When all this was over, with hymns and thanksgiving they blessed the Lord, who had shown such
great kindness to Israel and given them the victory.

2Ma 11:1 Almost immediately afterwards, Lysias, the king’s tutor and cousin, chief minister of the realm, much
disturbed at the turn of events,

2Ma 1 1 :2 mustered about eighty thousand foot soldiers and his entire cavalry and advanced against the Jews,
intending to make the city a place for Greeks to live in,

2Ma 1 1 :3 to levy a tax on the Temple as on other national shrines, and to put the office of high priest up for sale
every year;

2Ma 1 1 :4 he took no account at all of the power of God, being sublimely confident in his tens of thousands of
infantrymen, his thousands of cavalry, and his eighty elephants.

2Ma 1 1 :5 Invading Judaea, he approached Beth-Zur, a fortified position about twenty miles from Jerusalem, and
began to subject it to strong pressure.

2Ma 1 1 :6 When Maccabaeus and his men learned that Lysias was besieging the fortresses, they and the
populace with them begged the Lord with lamentation and tears to send a good angel to save Israel.

2Ma 1 1 :7 Maccabaeus himself was the first to take up his weapons, and he urged the rest to risk their lives with
him in support of their brothers; so they sallied out resolutely, as one man.

2Ma 1 1 :8 They were still near Jerusalem when a rider attired in white appeared at their head, brandishing
golden weapons.

2Ma 1 1 :9 With one accord they all blessed the God of mercy, and found themselves filled with such courage
that they were ready to lay low not men only but the fiercest beasts and walls of iron.

2Ma 11:10 They advanced in battle order with the aid of their celestial ally, the Lord having had mercy on them.
2Ma 11:11 Charging like lions on the enemy, they laid low eleven thousand of the infantry and sixteen hundred
horsemen, and routed all the rest.

2Ma 11:12 Of those, the majority got away, wounded and weaponless. Lysias himself escaped only by
ignominious flight.

2Ma 11:13 Now Lysias was not lacking in intelligence and, as he reflected on the reverse he had just suffered,
he realised that the Hebrews were invincible because the mighty God fought for them. He therefore sent them a
delegation

2Ma 11:14 to persuade them to accept reasonable terms all round, and promised to compel the king to become
their friend.

2Ma 11:15 Maccabaeus, thinking only of the common good, agreed to all that Lysias proposed, and whatever
Maccabaeus submitted to Lysias in writing concerning the Jews was granted by the king.

2Ma 11:16 Here is the text of the letter Lysias wrote to the Jews: “Lysias to the Jewish people, greetings.

2Ma 11:17 “John and Absalom, your envoys, have delivered to me the communication transcribed below,
requesting me to approve its provisions.

2Ma 11:18 Anything requiring the king’s attention I have put before him; whatever was possible, I have granted.
2Ma 11:19 Provided you maintain your goodwill towards the interests of the State, I shall do my best in the
future to promote your well-being.

2Ma 1 1 :20 As regards the details, I have given orders for your envoys and my own officials to discuss these
with you.

2Ma 1 1 :21 May you prosper. “The twenty-fourth day of Dioscorus, in the year one hundred and forty-eight”.

2Ma 1 1 :22 The king’s letter ran as follows: “King Antiochus to his brother Lysias, greetings.

2Ma 1 1 :23 “Now that our father has taken his place among the gods, our will is that the subjects of the realm be
left undisturbed to attend to their own affairs.

2Ma 1 1 :24 We understand that the Jews do not approve our father’s policy, the adoption of Greek customs, but
prefer their own way of life and ask to be allowed to observe their own laws.

2Ma 1 1 :25 Accordingly, since we intend this people to be free from vexation like any other, our ruling is that the
Temple be restored to them and that they conduct their affairs according to the customs of their ancestors.

2Ma 1 1 :26 “It will therefore be your concern to send them a mission of friendship, so that on learning our policy
they may have confidence and happily go about their business”.

2Ma 1 1 :27 The king’s letter to the Jewish nation was in these terms: “King Antiochus to the Jewish Senate and
the rest of the Jews, greetings.

2Ma 1 1 :28 “If you are well, that is as we would wish; we ourselves are in good health.

2Ma 1 1 :29 “Menelaus informs us that you wish to return home and attend to your own affairs.

2Ma 1 1 :30 Accordingly, all those who return before the thirtieth day of Xanthicus may rest assured that they
have nothing to fear.



2Ma 1 1 :31 The Jews may make use of their own kind of food and their own laws as formerly, and none of them
is to be molested in any way for any unwitting offences.

2Ma 1 1 :32 I am in fact sending Menelaus to set your minds at rest.

2Ma 1 1 :33 Farewell. The fifteenth day of Xanthicus in the year one hundred and forty-eight”.

2Ma 1 1 :34 The Romans also sent the Jews a letter, which read as follows: “Quintus Memmius, Titus Manilius,
Manius Sergius, legates of the Romans, to the people of the Jews, greetings.

2Ma 1 1 :35 “Whatever Lysias, the king’s Cousin, has granted you we also approve.

2Ma 1 1 :36 As for the matters he decided to refer to the king, consider them carefully and send someöne without
delay, if we are to interpret them to your advantage, because we are leaving for Antioch.

2Ma 1 1 :37 Lose no time, therefore, in sending us those who can tell us what your intentions are.

2Ma 1 1 :38 Farewell. “The fifteenth day of Dioscorus in the year one hundred and forty-eight”.

2Ma 12:1 These agreements once concluded, Lysias returned to the king and the Jews went back to their
farming.

2Ma 12:2 Among the local generals, Timotheus and Apollonius son of Gennaeus, as also Hieronymus and
Demophon, and Nicanor the Cypriarch as well, would not allow the Jews to live in peace and quiet.

2Ma 12:3 The people of Joppa committed a particularly wicked crime: they invited the Jews living among them
to go aboard some boats they had lying ready, taking their wives and children. There was no hint of any intention
to harm them;

2Ma 12:4 there had been a public vote by the citizens, and the Jews accepted, as well they might, being
peaceable people with no reason to suspect anything. But once out in the open sea they were all sent to the
bottom, a company of at least two hundred.

2Ma 12:5 When Judas heard of the cruel fate of his countrymen, he issued his orders to his men

2Ma 12:6 and after invoking God, the just judge, he attacked his brothers’ murderers. Under cover of dark he

set fire to the port, burned the boats and put to the sword everyone who had taken refuge there.

2Ma 12:7 As the town gates were closed, he withdrew, intending to come back and wipe out the whole
community of Joppa.

2Ma 12:8 But hearing that the people of Jamnia were planning to treat their resident Jews in the same way,

2Ma 1 2:9 he made a night attack on the Jamnites and fired the port with its fleet; the glow of the flames was
seen as far off as Jerusalem, thirty miles away.

2Ma 12:10 When they had left the town barely a mile behind them in their advance on Timotheus, Judas was
attacked by an Arab force of at least five thousand foot soldiers, with five hundred cavalry.

2Ma 12:1 1 A fierce engagement followed, and with God’s help Judas’ men won the day; the defeated nomads
begged Judas to offer them the right hand of friendship, and promised to surrender their herds and make
themselves generally useful to him.

2Ma 12:12 Realising that they might indeed prove valuable in many ways, Judas consented to make peace with
them and after an exchange of pledges the Arabs withdrew to their tents.

2Ma 12:13 Judas also attacked a certain fortified town, closed by ramparts and inhabited by a medley of races;
its name was Caspin.

2Ma 12:14 Confident in the strength of their walls and their stock of provisions, the besieged adopted an
insolent attitude to Judas and his men, reinforcing their insults with blasphemies and profanity.

2Ma 12:15 But Judas and his men invoked the great Sovereign of the world who without battering-ram or siege-
engine had overthrown Jericho in the days of Joshua; they then made a fierce assault on the wall.

2Ma 12:16 By God’s will, having captured the town, they made such indescribable slaughter that the nearby
lake, a quarter of a mile across, seemed filled to overflowing with blood.

2Ma 12:17 Ninety-five miles further on from there, they reached the Charax, in the country of Jews known as
Tubians.

2Ma 12:18 They did not find Timotheus himself in that neighbourhood; he had already left the district, having
achieved nothing apart from leaving a very strong garrison at one point.

2Ma 12:19 Dositheus and Sosipater, two of the Maccabaean generals, marched out and destroyed the force
Timotheus had left behind in the fortress, amounting to more than ten thousand men.

2Ma 12:20 Maccabaeus himself divided his army into cohorts to which he assigned commanders, and then
hurried in pursuit of Timotheus, whose troops numbered one hundred and twenty thousand infantry and two
thousand five hundred cavalry.

2Ma 12:21 Timotheus’ first move on learning of Judas’ advance was to send away the women and children and
the rest of the baggage train to the place called the Carnaim, since it was an impregnable position, difficult of
access owing to the narrowness of all the approaches.

2Ma 12:22 Judas’ cohort came into sight first. The enemy, seized with fright and panic-stricken by the
manifestation of the All-seeing, began to flee, one running this way, one running that, often wounding one
another in consequence and running on the points of one another’s swords.



2Ma 12:23 Judas pursued them with a will, cutting the sinners to pieces and killing something like thirty
thousand men.

2Ma 12:24 Timotheus himself, having fallen into the hands of Dositheus and Sosipater and their men, very
craftily pleaded with them to let him go with his life, on the grounds that he had the relatives and even the
brothers of many of them in his power, and that these could otherwise expect short shrift.

2Ma 12:25 When at long last he convinced them that he would honour his promise and return these people safe
and sound, they let him go for the sake of saving their brothers.

2Ma 12:26 Reaching the Carnaim and the Atargateion, Judas slaughtered twenty-five thousand men.

2Ma 12:27 Having defeated and destroyed them, he led his army against Ephron, a fortified town, where
Lysanias was living. Stalwart young men drawn up outside the walls offered vigorous resistance, while inside
there were quantities of war-engines and missiles in reserve.

2Ma 12:28 But the Jews, having invoked the Sovereign who by his power shatters enemies’ defences, gained
control of the town and cut down nearly twenty-five thousand of the people inside.

2Ma 12:29 Moving off from there, they pressed on to Scythopolis,

2Ma 12:30 seventy-five miles from Jerusalem. But as the Jews who had settled there assured Judas that the
people of Scythopolis had always treated them well and had been particularly kind to them when times were at
their worst,

2Ma 12:31 he and his men thanked them and urged them to extend the same friendship to his race in the future.
They reached Jerusalem shortly before the feast of Weeks.

2Ma 12:32 After Pentecost, as it is called, they marched against Gorgias, the general commanding Idumaea.
2Ma 12:33 He came out at the head of three thousand infantry and four hundred cavalry;

2Ma 12:34 in the course of the ensuing battle a few Jews lost their lives.

2Ma 12:35 A man called Dositheus, a horseman of the Tubian contingent, a valiant man, overpowered Gorgias
and, gripping him by the cloak, was forcibly dragging him along, intending to take the accursed man alive, but
one of the Thracian cavalry, hurling himself on Dositheus, slashed his shoulder, and Gorgias escaped to Marisa.
2Ma 12:36 Meanwhile, since Esdrias and his men had been fighting for a long time and were exhausted, Judas
called on the Lord to show himself their ally and leader in battle.

2Ma 12:37 Then, chanting the battle cry and hymns at the top of his voice in his ancestral tongue, by a surprise
attack he routed Gorgias’ troops.

2Ma 12:38 Judas then rallied his army and moved on to the town of Adullam where, as it was the seventh day of
the week, they purified themselves according to custom and kept the Sabbath.

2Ma 12:39 Next day, they came to find Judas (since the necessity was by now urgent) to have the bodies of the
fallen taken up and laid to rest among their relatives in their ancestral tombs.

2Ma 12:40 But when they found on each of the dead men, under their tunics, objects dedicated to the idols of
Jamnia, which the Law prohibits to Jews, it became clear to everyone that this was why these men had lost their
lives.

2Ma 12:41 All then blessed the ways of the Lord, the upright judge who brings hidden things to light,

2Ma 12:42 and gave themselves to prayer, begging that the sin committed might be completely forgiven. Next,
the valiant Judas urged the soldiers to keep themselves free from all sin, having seen with their own eyes the
effects of the sin of those who had fallen;

2Ma 12:43 after this he took a collection from them individually, amounting to nearly two thousand drachmas,
and sent it to Jerusalem to have a sacrifice for sin offered, an action altogether fine and noble, prompted by his
belief in the resurrection.

2Ma 12:44 For had he not expected the fallen to rise again, it would have been superfluous and foolish to pray
for the dead,

2Ma 12:45 whereäs if he had in view the splendid recompense reserved for those who make a pious end, the
thought was holy and devout. Hence, he had this expiatory sacrifice offered for the dead, so that they might be
released from their sin.

2Ma 13:1 In the year one hundred and forty-nine, Judas and his men discovered that Antiochus Eupatorwas
advancing in force against Judaea,

2Ma 1 3:2 and with him Lysias his tutor and chief minister; he had moreover a Greek force of one hundred and
ten thousand infantry, five thousand three hundred cavalry, twenty-two elephants, and three hundred chariots
fitted with scythes.

2Ma 1 3:3 Menelaus, too, joined them and very craftily kept urging Antiochus on, not for the welfare of his own
country but in the hope of being restored to office.

2Ma 13:4 But the King of kings stirred up the anger of Antiochus against the guilty wretch, and when Lysias
made it clear to the king that Menelaus was the cause of all the troubles, Antiochus gave orders for him to be
taken to Beroea and there put to death by the local method of execution.

2Ma 13:5 In that place there is a tower fifty cubits high, full of ash, with an internal lip all round overhanging the



ashes.

2Ma 1 3:6 If anyone is convicted of sacrilegious theft or of some other heinous crime, he is taken up to the top
and pushed over to perish.

2Ma 13:7 In such a manner was the renegade fated to die; Menelaus had not even the privilege of burial.

2Ma 13:8 Deserved justice, this; since he had committed many sins against the altar, the fire and ashes of
which were holy, it was in ashes that he met his death.

2Ma 13:9 The king, then, was advancing, his mind filled with barbarous designs, to give the Jews a
demonstration of far worse things than anything that had happened under his father.

2Ma 13:10 When Judas heard of this, he ordered the people day and night to call on the Lord as never before,
to come to the help of those who were in peril of being deprived of the Law, their fatherland and the holy Temple,
2Ma 13:1 1 and not to allow the people, just when they were beginning to breathe again, to fall into the power of
ill-famed foreigners.

2Ma 13:12 When they had all, with one voice, obeyed his instructions and had made their petitions to the
merciful Lord, weeping, fasting and prostrating themselves for three days continuously, Judas spoke words of
encouragement and told them to keep close to him.

2Ma 13:13 After separate consultation with the elders, he resolved not to wait for the king’s army to invade
Judaea and take possession of the city, but to march out and settle the whole matter with the Lord’s help.

2Ma 13:14 Having thus committed the outcome to the Creator of the world, and having exhorted his soldiers to
fight bravely to the death for the laws, the Temple, the city, their country and their way of life, he encamped his
army near Modein.

2Ma 13:15 Giving his men the password “Victory from God”, he made a night attack on the king’s pavilion with a
picked band of the bravest young men. Inside the camp he destroyed about two thousand, and his men cut
down the largest of the elephants with its mahout;

2Ma 13:16 having eventually filled the camp with terror and confusion, they successfully withdrew,

2Ma 13:17 just as dawn was breaking. This was achieved, thanks to the protection which the Lord granted
Judas.

2Ma 13:18 The king, having had a taste of Jewish daring, now tried to capture their positions by trickery.

2Ma 13:19 He advanced on Beth-Zur, a strong fortress of the Jews, but was checked, overcome and so
repulsed.

2Ma 13:20 Judas supplied the garrison with what they needed,

2Ma 13:21 but Rhodocus, of the Jewish army, supplied the enemy with secret information; the man was
identified, arrested, and dealt with.

2Ma 13:22 A second time, the king parleyed with the garrison of Beth-Zur; he offered and accepted pledges of
friendship, retired, then attacked Judas and his men, but lost the battle.

2Ma 1 3:23 He was then told that Philip, left in charge of affairs, had rebelled in Antioch. He was stunned by this,
opened negotiations with the Jews, came to an agreement, and swore to abide by all reasonable conditions.
Agreement reached, he offered a sacrifice, honoured the Temple, and made generous gifts to the holy place.
2Ma 13:24 He received Maccabaeus kindly and, leaving Hegemonides to exercise command from Ptolemais to
the territory of the Gerrenians,

2Ma 1 3:25 went to Ptolemais. The inhabitants of the place disapproved of the treaty; they complained furiously
and wanted to annul its provisions.

2Ma 13:26 Lysias mounted the rostrum and made a convincing defence of the provisions which convinced and
calmed them and won their goodwill. He then withdrew to Antioch. So much for the episode of the king’s
offensive and retreat.

2Ma 14:1 Three years after this, Judas and his men learned that Demetrius son of Seleucus had landed at the
port of Tripolis with a strong army and a fleet,

2Ma 14:2 and that he had occupied the country and had killed Antiochus and his tutor Lysias.

2Ma 14:3 A certain Alcimus, a former high priest, had wilfully incurred defilement at the time of the insurrection;
realising that whichever way he turned there was no security for him, nor any further access to the holy altar,

2Ma 14:4 he went to King Demetrius in about the year one hundred and fifty-one and presented him with a
golden crown and a palm, together with the traditional olive branches from the Temple; there, for that day, he let
the matter rest.

2Ma 14:5 Presently he found an opportunity to further his mad plan. When Demetrius called him into his council
and questioned him about the dispositions and intentions of the Jews, he replied,

2Ma 14:6 “Those Jews called Hasidaeans, who are led by Judas Maccabaeus, are war-mongers and rebels who
are preventing the kingdom from finding stability.

2Ma 14:7 That is why, after being deprived of my hereditary dignity — 1 mean the high priesthood — 1 have come
here now,

2Ma 14:8 first out of genuine concern for the king’s interests, and secondly, out of a regard for our own fellow-



citizens, because the irresponsible behaviour of those I have mentioned has brought no slight misery on our
entire race.

2Ma 14:9 When your majesty has taken note of all these points, may it please you to make provision for the
welfare of our country and our oppressed nation, as befits the gracious benevolence you extend to all;

2Ma 14:10 for, as long as Judas remains alive, the State will never enjoy peace”.

2Ma 14:11 No sooner had he spoken thus than the rest of the King’s Friends, who were hostile to Judas’
activities, stoked Demetrius’ anger.

2Ma 14:12 The latter at once selected Nicanor, then commander of the elephants, promoted him to the
command of Judaea and despatched him

2Ma 14:13 with instructions to dispose of Judas, disperse his followers and instal Alcimus as high priest of the
greatest of temples.

2Ma 14:14 The foreigners in Judaea, who had fled before Judas, flocked to join Nicanor, thinking that the
misfortunes and troubles of the Jews would be to their own advantage.

2Ma 14:15 When the Jews heard that Nicanor was coming and that the foreigners were about to attack, they
sprinkled dust over themselves and made supplication to him who had established his people for ever and who
never failed to support his own heritage by direct manifestations.

2Ma 14:16 On their leader’s orders, they at once left the place where they were and confronted the enemy at
the village of Dessau.

2Ma 14:17 Simon, brother of Judas, engaged Nicanor but, owing to the sudden arrival of the enemy, suffered a
slight reverse.

2Ma 14:18 Nicanor, however, had heard how brave Judas and his men were and how resolutely they always
fought for their country, and he did not dare allow bloodshed to decide the issue.

2Ma 14:19 And so he sent Posidonius, Theodotus and Mattathias to offer the Jews pledges of friendship and to
accept theirs.

2Ma 14:20 After careful consideration of his terms, the leader communicated them to his troops, and since they
were all clearly of one mind they agreed to the treaty.

2Ma 14:21 A day was fixed on which the respective leaders were to meet as individuals. A litter came out from
either side and seats were set up.

2Ma 14:22 Judas had posted armed men in strategic positions, in case of a sudden treacherous move by the
enemy. The leaders held their conference and reached agreement.

2Ma 14:23 Nicanor took up residence in Jerusalem and did nothing out of place there; indeed, he sent away the
crowds that had flocked to join him.

2Ma 14:24 He kept Judas constantly with him, becoming deeply attached to him

2Ma 14:25 and encouraged him to marry and have children. Judas married, settled down and led a normal life.
2Ma 14:26 When Alcimus saw how friendly the two men had become, he went to Demetrius with a copy of the
treaty they had signed and told him that Nicanor was harbouring thoughts against the interests of the State, and
was planning that Judas, an enemy of the realm, should fill the next vacancy among the Friends of the King.

2Ma 14:27 The king flew into a rage; roused by the slanders of this villain, he wrote to Nicanor, telling him of his
strong displeasure at these agreements and ordering him immediately to send Maccabaeus to Antioch in chains.
2Ma 14:28 When the letter reached Nicanor, he was very much upset, for he disliked the prospect of breaking
an agreement with a man who had done nothing wrong.

2Ma 14:29 Since, however, there was no way of opposing the king, he waited for an opportunity to carry out the
order by a stratagem.

2Ma 14:30 Maccabaeus began to notice that Nicanor was treating him more sharply and that his manner of
speaking to him was more abrupt than it had been, and he concluded that such sharpness could have no very
good motive. He therefore collected a considerable number of his followers and got away from Nicanor.

2Ma 14:31 The latter, realising that the man had well and truly outmanoeuvred him, went to the greatest and
holiest of Temples when the priests were offering the customary sacrifices, and ordered them to surrender
Judas.

2Ma 14:32 When they protested on oath that they did not know where the wanted man could be,

2Ma 14:33 he stretched out his right hand towards the Temple and swore this oath, “If you do not hand Judas
over to me as prisoner, I shall rase this dwelling of God to the ground, I shall demolish the altar, and on this very
spot I shall erect a splendid temple to Dionysus”.

2Ma 14:34 With these words he left them. The priests stretched out their hands to heaven, calling on him who
has at all times done battle for our nation; this was their prayer:

2Ma 14:35 “O Lord in need of nothing, it has pleased you that the Temple where you dwell should be here with
us.

2Ma 14:36 Now, therefore, holy Lord of all holiness, preserve for ever from all profanation this House, so newly
purified”.



2Ma 14:37 Now, a man called Razis, one of the elders of Jerusalem, was denounced to Nicanor. He was a man
who loved his countrymen and stood high in their esteem, and he was known as the father of the Jews because
of his kindness.

2Ma 14:38 In the earlier days of the insurrection he had been convicted of Judaism, and he had risked both life
and limb for Judaism with the utmost zeal.

2Ma 1 4:39 Nicanor, by way of demonstrating the enmity he had for the Jews, sent over five hundred soldiers to
arrest him,

2Ma 14:40 reckoning that if he eliminated this man he would be dealing them a severe blow.

2Ma 14:41 When the troops were on the point of capturing the tower and were forcing the outer door and calling
for fire to set the doors alight, Razis, finding himself completely surrounded, fell on his own sword,

2Ma 14:42 nobly resolving to die rather than fall into the clutches of these villains and suffer outrages unworthy
of his noble birth.

2Ma 14:43 But in the heat of conflict he missed his thrust, and while the troops swarmed in through the
doorways, he ran nimbly upstairs to the parapet and manfully threw himself down among the troops.

2Ma 14:44 But, as they immediately drew back, he fell into the middle of the empty space.

2Ma 14:45 Still breathing, and blazing with anger, he struggled to his feet, blood spurting in all directions, and
despite his terrible wounds ran right through the crowd; then, taking his stand on a steep rock,

2Ma 14:46 although he had now lost every drop of blood, he tore out his entrails and taking them in both hands
flung them down on the crowd, calling on the Master of his life and spirit to give them back to him one day. Thus
he died.

2Ma 15:1 Nicanor heard that Judas and his men were in the neighbourhood of Samaria, so he decided to attack
them, at no risk to himself, on the day of rest.

2Ma 15:2 Those Jews who had been compelled to follow him, said, “Do not massacre them in such a savage,
barbarous way. Respect the day on which the All-seeing has conferred a special holiness”.

2Ma 15:3 At this the triple-dyed scoundrel asked if there were in heaven a sovereign who had ordered the
keeping of the Sabbath day.

2Ma 15:4 When they answered, “The living Lord himself, the Heavenly Sovereign, has ordered the observance
of the seventh day”,

2Ma 15:5 he retorted, “And I, as sovereign on earth, order you to take up arms and do the king’s business”. For
all that, he did not manage to carry out his wicked plan.

2Ma 15:6 While Nicanor, in his unlimited boastfulness and pride, was planning to erect a general trophy with the
spoils taken from Judas and his men,

2Ma 15:7 Maccabaeus remained firm in his confident conviction that the Lord would stand by him.

2Ma 15:8 He urged his men not to be dismayed by the foreigners’ attacks but, keeping in mind the help that had
come to them from Heaven in the past, to be confident that this time too victory would be theirs with the help of
the Almighty.

2Ma 15:9 He put fresh heart into them by citing the Law and the Prophets and, by stirring up memories of the
battles they had already won, he filled them with new enthusiasm.

2Ma 15:10 Having thus aroused their courage, he ended his exhortation by demonstrating the treachery of the
foreigners and how they had violated their oaths.

2Ma 15:1 1 Having armed each one of them not so much with the safety given by shield and lance as with that
confidence which springs from noble language, he encouraged them all by describing to them a convincing
dream — a vision, as it were.

2Ma 15:12 What he had seen was this: Onias, the former high priest, that paragon of men, modest of bearing
and gentle of manners, suitably eloquent and trained from boyhood in the practice of every virtue — Onias was
stretching out his hands and praying for the whole Jewish community.

2Ma 15:13 Next, there appeared a man equally remarkable for his great age and dignity and invested with a
marvellous and impressive air of majesty.

2Ma 15:14 Onias began to speak: “This is a man”, he said, “who loves his brothers and prays much for the
people and the holy city-Jeremiah, the prophet of God”.

2Ma 15:15 Jeremiah then stretched out his right hand and presented Judas with a golden sword, saying as he
gave it,

2Ma 15:16 “Take this holy sword as a gift from God; with it you will shatter the enemy”.

2Ma 15:17 Encouraged by the noble words of Judas, which had the power to inspire valour and give the young
the spirit of mature men, they decided not to entrench themselves in a camp, but bravely to take the offensive
and, in hand-to-hand fighting, to commit the result to the fortune of war, since the city, their holy religion and the
Temple were in danger.

2Ma 15:18 Their concern for their wives and children, their brothers and relatives, had shrunk to minute
importance; their chief and greatest fear was for the consecrated Temple.



2Ma 15:19 Those left behind in the city felt a similar anxiety, alarmed as they were about the forthcoming
encounter in the open country.

2Ma 15:20 Everyone now awaited the coming issue. The enemy had already concentrated their forces and
stood formed up in order of battle, with the elephants drawn up in a strategic position and the cavalry disposed
on the wings.

2Ma 15:21 Maccabaeus took note of these masses confronting him, the glittering array of armour and the fierce
aspect of the elephants; then, raising his hands to heaven, he called on the Lord who works miracles, in the
knowledge that it is not by force of arms but as he sees fit to decide, that victory is granted by him to such as
deserve it.

2Ma 15:22 His prayer was worded thus: “You, Master, sent your angel in the days of Hezekiah king of Judaea,
and he destroyed no less than one hundred and eighty-five thousand of Sennacherib’s army;

2Ma 15:23 now, once again, Sovereign of heaven, send a good angel before us to spread terror and dismay.
2Ma 15:24 May these men be struck down by the might of your arm, since they have come with blasphemy on
their lips to attack your holy people”. And on these words he finished.

2Ma 15:25 Nicanor and his men advanced to the sound of trumpets and war songs,

2Ma 15:26 but the men of Judas closed with the enemy uttering invocations and prayers.

2Ma 15:27 Fighting with their hands and praying to God in their hearts, they cut down at least thirty-five
thousand men and were greatly cheered by this manifestation of God.

2Ma 15:28 When the engagement was over and they were withdrawing in triumph, they recognised Nicanor,
lying dead in full armour.

2Ma 15:29 With shouting and confusion all around, they blessed the sovereign Master in their ancestral tongue.
2Ma 15:30 He who, as protagonist, had devoted himself, body and soul, to his fellow-citizens, and had
preserved the love he felt even in youth for those of his own race, gave orders for Nicanor’s head to be cut off,
with his arm up to the shoulder, and taken to Jerusalem.

2Ma 15:31 When he arrived there himself, he called his countrymen together, stationed the priests in front of the
altar and then sent for the people from the Citadel.

2Ma 15:32 He showed them the head of the abominable Nicanor, and the hand which this infamous man had
stretched out so insolently against the holy House of the Almighty.

2Ma 1 5:33 Then, cutting out godless Nicanor’s tongue, he gave orders for it to be fed piecemeal to the birds,
and for the salary of his folly to be hung up in front of the Temple.

2Ma 15:34 At this, everyone sent blessings heavenwards to the glorious Lord, saying, “Blessed be he who has
preserved his holy place from pollution!”.

2Ma 15:35 He hung Nicanor’s head from the Citadel, a clear and evident sign to all of the help of the Lord.

2Ma 15:36 They all decreed by public vote never to let that day go by unobserved, but to celebrate the
thirteenth day of the twelfth month, called Adar in Aramaic, the eve of what is called the Day of Mordecai.

2Ma 15:37 So ends the episode of Nicanor, and as, since then, the city has remained in the possession of the
Hebrews, I shall bring my own work to an end here too.

2Ma 15:38 If it is well composed and to the point, that is just what I wanted. If it is worthless and mediocre, that
is all I could manage.

2Ma 15:39 Just as it is injurious to drink wine by itself, or again water alone, whereäs wine mixed with water is
pleasant and produces a delightful sense of well-being, so skill in presenting the incidents is what delights the
understanding of those who read the book. And here I close.
