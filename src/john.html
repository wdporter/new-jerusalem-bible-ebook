<h2 id="a">A: Prologue (1:1–18)</h2>

<blockquote>In the beginning was the Word: <br />
the Word was with God <br />
and the Word was God.<br />
He was with God in the beginning.<br />
Through him all things came into being, <br />
not one thing came into being except through him. <br />
What has come into being in him was life, <br />
life that was the light of men; <br />
and light shines in darkness, <br />
and darkness could not overpower it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A man came, sent by God. <br />
His name was John. <br />
He came as a witness, <br />
to bear witness to the light, <br />
so that everyone might believe through him. <br />
He was not the light, <br />
he was to bear witness to the light.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Word was the real light <br />
that gives light to everyone; <br />
he was coming into the world. <br />
He was in the world <br />
that had come into being through him, <br />
and the world did not recognise him. <br />
He came to his own <br />
and his own people did not accept him. <br />
But to those who did accept him <br />
he gave power to become children of God, <br />
to those who believed in his name <br />
who were born not from human stock <br />
or human desire <br />
or human will <br />
but from God himself. <br />
The Word became flesh, <br />
he lived among us, <br />
and we saw his glory, <br />
the glory that he has from the Father as only Son of the Father, <br />
full of grace and truth.</blockquote>

<blockquote>John witnesses to him. He proclaims: <br />
“This is the one of whom I said: <br />
He who comes after me <br />
has passed ahead of me <br />
because he existed before me”.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Indeed, from his fullness we have, all of us, received — <br />
one gift replacing another, <br />
for the Law was given through Moses, <br />
grace and truth have come through Jesus Christ. <br />
No one has ever seen God; <br />
it is the only Son, who is close to the Father’s heart, <br />
who has made him known.</blockquote>

<h2 id="b">B: Jesus’ Ministry (1:19–12:50)</h2>

<h3 id="bi">I: Proclamation of the New Order<br />
The Ministry of Jesus (1:19–4:54)</h3>

<h4 id="bia">A: The Opening Week (1:19–2:12)</h4>

<h5>The witness of John (1:19–34)</h5>

<p>This was the witness of John, when the Jews sent to him priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”.</p>

<p>He declared, he did not deny but declared, “I am not the Christ”.</p>

<p>So they asked, “Then are you Elijah?”. </p>

<p>He replied, “I am not”.</p>

<p>“Are you the Prophet?”.</p>

<p>He answered, “No”.</p>

<p>So they said to him, “Who are you? We must take back an answer to those who sent us. What have you to say about yourself?”.</p>

<p>So he said, “I am, as Isaiah prophesied: </p>

<blockquote>A voice of one that cries in the desert: <br />
Prepare a way for the Lord. <br />
Make his paths straight!</blockquote>

<p>Now those who had been sent were Pharisees, and they put this question to him, “Why are you baptising if you are not the Christ, and not Elijah, and not the Prophet?”.</p>

<p>John answered them, “I baptise with water; but standing among you — unknown to you — is the one who is coming after me; and I am not fit to undo the strap of his sandal”. This happened at Bethany, on the far side of the Jordan, where John was baptising.</p>

<p>The next day, he saw Jesus coming towards him and said, “Look, there is the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world. It was of him that I said, ‘Behind me comes one who has passed ahead of me because he existed before me’. I did not know him myself, and yet my purpose in coming to baptise with water was so that he might be revealed to Israel”. And John declared, “I saw the Spirit come down on him like a dove from heaven and rest on him. I did not know him myself, but he who sent me to baptise with water had said to me, ‘The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and rest is the one who is to baptise with the Holy Spirit’. I have seen and I testify that he is the Chosen One of God”.</p>

<h5>The first disciples (1:35–51)</h5>

<p>The next day as John stood there again with two of his disciples, Jesus went past, and John looked towards him and said, “Look, there is the lamb of God”. And the two disciples heard what he said and followed Jesus. </p>

<p>Jesus turned round, saw them following and said, “What do you want?”. </p>

<p>They answered, “<i>Rabbi</i>” — which means Teacher — “where do you live?”.</p>

<p>He replied, “Come and see”; so they went and saw where he lived, and stayed with him that day. It was about the tenth hour.</p>

<p>One of these two who became followers of Jesus after hearing what John had said was Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter. The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother and say to him, “We have found the <i>Messiah</i>” — which means the Christ — and he took Simon to Jesus. </p>

<p>Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon son of John; you are to be called <i>Cephas</i>” — which means Rock.</p>

<p>The next day, after Jesus had decided to leave for Galilee, he met Philip and said, “Follow me”. Philip came from the same town, Bethsaida, as Andrew and Peter.</p>

<p>Philip found Nathanael and said to him, “We have found him of whom Moses in the Law and the prophets wrote, Jesus son of Joseph, from Nazareth”.</p>

<p>Nathanael said to him, “From Nazareth? Can anything good come from that place?”.</p>

<p>Philip replied, “Come and see”.</p>

<p>When Jesus saw Nathanael coming he said of him, “There, truly, is an Israelite in whom there is no deception”.</p>

<p>Nathanael asked, “How do you know me?”. </p>

<p>Jesus replied, “Before Philip came to call you, I saw you under the fig tree”.</p>

<p>Nathanael answered, “<i>Rabbi</i>, you are the Son of God, you are the king of Israel”.</p>

<p>Jesus replied, “You believe that just because I said: I saw you under the fig tree. You are going to see greater things than that”. And then he added, “In all truth I tell you, you will see heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending over the Son of man”.</p>

<h5>The wedding at Cana (2:1–12)</h5>

<p>On the third day there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee. The mother of Jesus was there, and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited. And they ran out of wine, since the wine provided for the feast had all been used, and the mother of Jesus said to him, “They have no wine”. </p>

<p>Jesus said, “Woman, what do you want from me? My hour has not come yet”.</p>

<p>His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you”. There were six stone water jars standing there, meant for the ablutions that are customary among the Jews: each could hold twenty or thirty gallons. </p>

<p>Jesus said to the servants, “Fill the jars with water”, and they filled them to the brim. Then he said to them, “Draw some out now and take it to the president of the feast”. They did this; the president tasted the water, and it had turned into wine. </p>

<p>Having no idea where it came from — though the servants who had drawn the water knew — the president of the feast called the bridegroom and said, “Everyone serves good wine first and the worse wine when the guests are well wined; but you have kept the best wine until now”.</p>

<p>This was the first of Jesus’ signs: it was at Cana in Galilee. He revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him. After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and his brothers and his disciples, but they 
stayed there only a few days. </p>

<h4 id="bib">B: The Passover (2:13–4:54)</h4>

<h5>The cleansing of the Temple (2:13–22)</h5>

<p>When the time of the Jewish Passover was near Jesus went up to Jerusalem, and in the Temple he found people selling cattle and sheep and doves, and the money changers sitting there. Making a whip out of cord, he drove them all out of the Temple, sheep and cattle as well, scattered the money changers’ coins, knocked their tables over and said to the dove sellers, “Take all this out of here and stop using my Father’s house as a market”. Then his disciples remembered the words of scripture: I am eaten up with zeal for your house. </p>

<p>The Jews intervened and said, “What sign can you show us that you should act like this?”.</p>

<p>Jesus answered, “Destroy this Temple, and in three days I will raise it up”.</p>

<p>The Jews replied, “It has taken forty-six years to build this Temple: are you going to raise it up again in three days?”. But he was speaking of the Temple that was his body, and when Jesus rose from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the scripture and what he had said. </p>

<h5>Jesus in Jerusalem (2:23–25)</h5>

<p>During his stay in Jerusalem for the feast of the Passover many believed in his name when they saw the signs that he did, but Jesus knew all people and did not trust himself to them; he never needed evidence about anyone; he could tell what someone had in him.</p>

<h5>The conversation with Nicodemus (3:1–21)</h5>

<p>There was one of the Pharisees called Nicodemus, a leader of the Jews, who came to Jesus by night and said, “<i>Rabbi</i>, we know that you have come from God as a teacher; for no one could perform the signs that you do unless God were with him”.</p>

<p>Jesus answered:</p>

<blockquote>In all truth I tell you, <br />
no one can see the kingdom of God <br />
without being born from above. </blockquote>

<p>Nicodemus said, “How can anyone who is already old be born? Is it possible to go back into the womb again and be born?”.</p>

<p>Jesus replied:</p>

<blockquote>In all truth I tell you, <br />
no one can enter the kingdom of God <br />
without being born through water and the Spirit; <br />
what is born of human nature is human; <br />
what is born of the Spirit is spirit. <br />
Do not be surprised when I say: <br />
You must be born from above. <br />
The wind blows where it pleases; <br />
you can hear its sound, <br />
but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. <br />
So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit. </blockquote>

<p>“How is that possible?”, asked Nicodemus. </p>

<p>Jesus replied, “You are the Teacher of Israel, and you do not know these things!</p>

<blockquote> 
In all truth I tell you, <br />
we speak only about what we know <br />
and witness only to what we have seen <br />
and yet you people reject our evidence. <br />
If you do not believe me <br />
when I speak to you about earthly things, <br />
how will you believe me <br />
when I speak to you about heavenly things? <br />
No one has gone up to heaven <br />
except the one who came down from heaven, <br />
the Son of man; <br />
as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, <br />
so must the Son of man be lifted up <br />
so that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him. <br />
For this is how God loved the world: <br />
he gave his only Son, <br />
so that everyone who believes in him may not perish <br />
but may have eternal life. <br />
For God sent his Son into the world <br />
not to judge the world, <br />
but so that through him the world might be saved. <br />
No one who believes in him will be judged; <br />
but whoëver does not believe is judged already, <br />
because that person does not believe <br />
in the Name of God’s only Son. <br />
And the judgement is this: <br />
though the light has come into the world <br />
people have preferred <br />
darkness to the light <br />
because their deeds were evil. <br />
And indeed, everybody who does wrong <br />
hates the light and avoids it, <br />
to prevent his actions from being shown up; <br />
but whoëver does the truth <br />
comes out into the light, <br />
so that what he is doing may plainly appear as done in God.</blockquote>

<h5>Jesus’ ministry in Judaea <br />
John bears witness for the last time (3:22–36)</h5>

<p>After this, Jesus went with his disciples into the Judaean countryside and stayed with them there and baptised. John also was baptising at Aenon near Salim, where there was plenty of water, and people were going there and were being baptised. For John had not yet been put in prison. </p>

<p>Now a discussion arose between some of John’s disciples and a Jew about purification, so they went to John and said, “<i>Rabbi</i>, the man who was with you on the far side of the Jordan, the man to whom you bore witness, is baptising now, and everyone is going to him”.</p>

<p>John replied:</p>

<blockquote>No one can have anything <br />
except what is given him from heaven.</blockquote>

<p>“You yourselves can bear me out. I said, ‘I am not the Christ; I am the one who has been sent to go in front of him’.</p>

<blockquote>It is the bridegroom who has the bride; <br />
and yet the bridegroom’s friend, <br />
who stands there and listens to him, <br />
is filled with joy at the bridegroom’s voice. <br />
This is the joy I feel, and it is complete. <br />
He must grow greater, <br />
I must grow less. <br />
He who comes from above <br />
is above all others; <br />
he who is of the earth <br />
is earthly himself and speaks in an earthly way. <br />
He who comes from heaven <br />
bears witness to the things he has seen and heard, <br />
but his testimony is not accepted by anybody; <br />
though anyone who does accept his testimony <br />
is attesting that God is true, <br />
since he whom God has sent <br />
speaks God’s own words, <br />
for God gives him the Spirit without reserve. <br />
The Father loves the Son <br />
and has entrusted everything to his hands. <br />
Anyone who believes in the Son has eternal life, <br />
but anyone who refuses to believe in the Son will never see life: <br />
God’s retribution hangs over him. </blockquote>

<h5>Jesus among the Samaritans (4:1–42)</h5>

<p>When Jesus heard that the Pharisees had found out that he was making and baptising more disciples than John — though in fact it was his disciples who baptised, not Jesus himself — he left Judaea and went back to Galilee. He had to pass through Samaria. On the way he came to the Samaritan town called Sychar near the land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. Jacob’s well was there and Jesus, tired by the journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour. When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, “Give me something to drink”. His disciples had gone into the town to buy food. </p>

<p>The Samaritan woman said to him, “You are a Jew. How is it that you ask me, a Samaritan, for something to drink?” — Jews, of course, do not associate with Samaritans. </p>

<p>Jesus replied to her: </p>

<blockquote>If you only knew what God is offering <br />
and who it is that is saying to you, <br />
“Give me something to drink”, <br />
you would have been the one to ask, <br />
and he would have given you living water. </blockquote>

<p>“You have no bucket, sir”, she answered, “and the well is deep: how do you get this living water?. Are you a greater man than our father Jacob, who gave us this well and drank from it himself with his sons and his cattle?”</p>

<p>Jesus replied:</p>

<blockquote>Whoëver drinks this water <br />
will be thirsty again; <br />
but no one who drinks the water that I shall give him <br />
will ever be thirsty again: <br />
the water that I shall give him <br />
will become in him a spring of water, welling up for eternal life. </blockquote>

<p>“Sir”, said the woman, “give me some of that water, so that I may never be thirsty or come here again to draw water”. </p>

<p>“Go and call your husband”, said Jesus to her, “and come back here”.</p>

<p>The woman answered, “I have no husband”. </p>

<p>Jesus said to her, “You are right to say, ‘I have no husband’; for although you have had five, the one you now have is not your husband. You spoke the truth there”.</p>

<p>“I see you are a prophet, sir”, said the woman. “Our fathers worshipped on this mountain, though you say that Jerusalem is the place where one ought 
to worship”.</p>

<p>Jesus said: </p>

<blockquote>Believe me, woman, the hour is coming <br />
when you will worship the Father <br />
neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. <br />
You worship what you do not know; <br />
we worship what we do know; <br />
for salvation comes from the Jews. <br />
But the hour is coming — indeed is already here — <br />
when true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth: <br />
that is the kind of worshipper <br />
the Father seeks. <br />
God is spirit, <br />
and those who worship <br />
must worship in spirit and truth. </blockquote>

<p>The woman said to him, “I know that <i>Messiah</i> — that is, Christ — is coming; and when he comes he will explain everything”.</p>

<p>Jesus said, “That is who I am, I who speak to you”.</p>

<p>At this point his disciples returned and were surprised to find him speaking to a woman, though none of them asked, “What do you want from her?”, or, “What are you talking to her about?”. </p>

<p>The woman put down her water jar and hurried back to the town to tell the people, “Come and see a man who has told me everything I have done; could this be the Christ?”. This brought people out of the town and they made their way towards him. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the disciples were urging him, “Rabbi, do have something to eat”; but he said, “I have food to eat that you do not know about”. </p>

<p>So the disciples said to one another, “Has someone brought him food?”.</p>

<p>But Jesus said: </p>

<blockquote>My food <br />
is to do the will of the one who sent me, <br />
and to complete his work. <br />
Do you not have a saying: <br />
Four months and then the harvest? <br />
Well, I tell you, <br />
look around you, look at the fields; <br />
already they are white, ready for harvest! <br />
Already the reaper is being paid his wages, <br />
already he is bringing in the grain for eternal life, <br />
so that sower and reaper can rejoice together. <br />
For here the proverb holds true: <br />
one sows, another reaps; <br />
I sent you to reap <br />
a harvest you have not laboured for. <br />
Others have laboured for it; <br />
and you have come into the rewards of their labour. </blockquote>

<p>Many Samaritans of that town believed in him on the strength of the woman’s words of testimony, “He told me everything I have done”. So, when the Samaritans came up to him, they begged him to stay with them. </p>

<p>He stayed for two days, and many more came to believe on the strength of the words he spoke to them; and they said to the woman, “Now we believe no longer because of what you told us; we have heard him ourselves and we know that he is indeed the Saviour of the world”.</p>

<h5>Jesus in Galilee (4:43–45)</h5>

<p>When the two days were over Jesus left for Galilee. He himself had declared that a prophet is not honoured in his own home town. On his arrival the Galileans received him well, having seen all that he had done at Jerusalem during the festival which they too had attended. </p>

<h5>Second sign at Cana<br />
The cure of a royal official’s son (4:46–54)</h5>

<p>He went again to Cana in Galilee, where he had changed the water into wine. And there was a royal official whose son was ill at Capernaum; hearing that Jesus had arrived in Galilee from Judaea, he went and asked him to come and cure his son, as he was at the point of death. Jesus said to him, “Unless you see signs and portents you will not believe!”. </p>

<p>“Sir”, answered the official, “come down before my child dies”. </p>

<p>“Go home”, said Jesus, “your son will live”. The man believed what Jesus had said and went on his way home; and while he was still on the way his servants met him with the news that his boy was alive. He asked them when the boy had begun to recover. </p>

<p>They replied, “The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour”. </p>

<p>The father realised that this was exactly the time when Jesus had said, “Your son will live”; and he and all his household believed. </p>

<p>This new sign, the second, Jesus performed on his return from Judaea to Galilee. </p>

<h3 id="bii">II: The Second Feast at Jerusalem <br />First Opposition to Revelation (5:1–47)</h3>

<h4>The cure of a sick man at the Pool of Bethesda (5:1–47)</h4>

<p>After this there was a Jewish festival, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. Now in Jerusalem next to the Sheep Pool there is a pool called Bethesda in Hebrew, which has five porticos; and under these were crowds of sick people, blind, lame, paralysed. One man there had an illness which had lasted thirty-eight years, and when Jesus saw him lying there and knew he had been in that condition for a long time, he said, “Do you want to be well again?”. </p>

<p>“Sir”, replied the sick man, “I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is disturbed; and while I am still on the way, someone else gets down there before me”. </p>

<p>Jesus said, “Get up, pick up your sleeping-mat and walk around”. The man was cured at once, and he picked up his mat and started to walk around. </p>

<p>Now that day happened to be the Sabbath, so the Jews said to the man who had been cured, “It is the Sabbath; you are not allowed to carry your sleeping-mat”. </p>

<p>He replied, “But the man who cured me told me, ‘Pick up your sleeping-mat and walk around’”. </p>

<p>They asked, “Who is the man who said to you, ‘Pick up your sleeping-mat and walk around’?”. The man had no idea who it was, since Jesus had disappeared, as the place was crowded. </p>

<p>After a while Jesus met him in the Temple and said, “Now you are well again, do not sin any more, or something worse may happen to you”. The man went back and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had cured him. It was because he did things like this on the Sabbath that the Jews began to harass Jesus. His answer to them was, “My Father still goes on working, and I am at work, too”. But that only made the Jews even more intent on killing him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he spoke of God as his own Father and so made himself God’s equal. </p>

<p>To this Jesus replied: </p>

<blockquote>In all truth I tell you, <br />
by himself the Son can do nothing; <br />
he can do only what he sees the Father doing: <br />
and whatever the Father does the Son does too. <br />
For the Father loves the Son <br />
and shows him everything he himself does, <br />
and he will show him even greater things than these, <br />
works that will astonish you. <br />
Thus, as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, <br />
so the Son gives life to anyone he chooses; <br />
for the Father judges no one; <br />
he has entrusted all judgement to the Son, <br />
so that all may honour the Son <br />
as they honour the Father. <br />
Whoëver refuses honour to the Son <br />
refuses honour to the Father who sent him. <br />
In all truth I tell you, <br />
whoëver listens to my words, <br />
and believes in the one who sent me, <br />
has eternal life; <br />
without being brought to judgement <br />
such a person has passed from death to life. <br />
In all truth I tell you, <br />
the hour is coming — indeed it is already here — <br />
when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, <br />
and all who hear it will live. <br />
For as the Father has life in himself, <br />
so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself; <br />
and, because he is the Son of man, <br />
has granted him power to give judgement. <br />
Do not be surprised at this, <br />
for the hour is coming <br />
when the dead will leave their graves <br />
at the sound of his voice: <br />
those who did good <br />
will come forth to life; <br />
and those who did evil will come forth to judgement. <br />
By myself I can do nothing; <br />
I can judge only as I am told to judge, <br />
and my judging is just, <br />
because I seek to do not my own will <br />
but the will of him who sent me. <br />
Were I to testify on my own behalf, <br />
my testimony would not be true; <br />
but there is another witness who speaks on my behalf, <br />
and I know that his testimony is true. <br />
You sent messengers to John, <br />
and he gave his testimony to the truth — <br />
not that I depend on human testimony; <br />
no, it is for your salvation that I mention it. <br />
John was a lamp lit and shining <br />
and for a time you were content to enjoy the light that he gave. <br />
But my testimony is greater than John’s: <br />
the deeds my Father has given me to perform,<br />
these same deeds of mine <br />
testify that the Father has sent me. <br />
Besides, the Father who sent me <br />
bears witness to me himself. <br />
You have never heard his voice, <br />
you have never seen his shape, <br />
and his word finds no home in you <br />
because you do not believe <br />
in the one whom he has sent. </blockquote>

<blockquote>You pore over the scriptures, <br />
believing that in them you can find eternal life; <br />
it is these scriptures that testify to me, <br />
and yet you refuse to come to me to receive life! <br />
Human glory means nothing to me. <br />
Besides, I know you too well: <br />
you have no love of God in you. <br />
I have come in the name of my Father <br />
and you refuse to accept me; <br />
if someone else should come in his own name <br />
you would accept him. <br />
How can you believe, <br />
since you look to each other for glory <br />
and are not concerned <br />
with the glory that comes from the one God? <br />
Do not imagine that I am going to accuse you before the Father: <br />
you have placed your hopes on Moses, <br />
and Moses will be the one who accuses you. <br />
If you really believed him <br />
you would believe me too, <br />
since it was about me that he was writing; <br />
but if you will not believe what he wrote, <br />
how can you believe what I say? </blockquote>

<h3 id="biii">III: The Passover of the Bread of Life <br />
Further Opposition to Revelation (6:1–71)</h3>

<h4>The miracle of the loaves (6:1–15)</h4>

<p>After this, Jesus crossed the Sea of Galilee — or of Tiberias — and a large crowd followed him, impressed by the signs he had done in curing the sick. Jesus climbed the hillside and sat down there with his disciples. The time of the Jewish Passover was near. </p>

<p>Looking up, Jesus saw the crowds approaching and said to Philip, “Where can we buy some bread for these people to eat?”. He said this only to put Philip to the test; he himself knew exactly what he was going to do. </p>

<p>Philip answered, “Two hundred denarii would not buy enough to give them a little piece each”. </p>

<p>One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said, “Here is a small boy with five barley loaves and two fish; but what is that among so many?”. </p>

<p>Jesus said to them, “Make the people sit down”. There was plenty of grass there, and as many as five thousand men sat down. Then Jesus took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed them to those who were sitting there; he then did the same with the fish, distributing as much as they wanted. When they had eaten enough he said to the disciples, “Pick up the pieces left over, so that nothing is wasted”. So they picked them up and filled twelve large baskets with scraps left over from the meal of five barley loaves. </p>

<p>Seeing the sign that he had done, the people said, “This is indeed the prophet who is to come into the world”. Jesus, as he realised they were about to come and take him by force and make him king, fled back to the hills alone. </p>

<h4>Jesus comes to hid disciples walking on the waters (6:16–21)</h4>

<p>That evening the disciples went down to the shore of the sea and got into a boat to make for Capernaum on the other side of the sea. It was getting dark by now and Jesus had still not rejoined them. The wind was strong, and the sea was getting rough. They had rowed three or four miles when they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming towards the boat. They were afraid, but he said, “It’s me. Don’t be afraid”. They were ready to take him into the boat, and immediately it reached the shore at the place they were making for. </p>

<h4>The discourse in the synagogue at Capernaum (6:22–66)</h4>

<p>Next day, the crowd that had stayed on the other side saw that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not got into the boat with his disciples, but that the disciples had set off by themselves. Other boats, however, had put in from Tiberias, near the place where the bread had been eaten. When the people saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into those boats and crossed to Capernaum to look for Jesus. When they found him on the other side, they said to him, “Rabbi, when did you come here?”. </p>

<p>Jesus answered: </p>

<blockquote>In all truth I tell you, <br />
you are looking for me <br />
not because you have seen the signs <br />
but because you had all the bread you wanted to eat. <br />
Do not work for food that goes bad, <br />
but work for food that endures for eternal life, <br />
which the Son of man will give you, <br />
for on him the Father, God himself, has set his seal. </blockquote>

<p>Then they said to him, “What must we do if we are to carry out God’s work?”. </p>

<p>Jesus gave them this answer, “This is carrying out God’s work: you must believe in the one he has sent”. </p>

<p>So they said, “What sign will you yourself do, the sight of which will make us believe in you? What work will you do? Our fathers ate manna in the desert; as scripture says: He gave them bread from heaven to eat”. </p>

<p>Jesus answered them: </p>

<blockquote>In all truth I tell you, <br />
it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, <br />
it is my Father who gives you the bread from heaven, <br />
the true bread; <br />
for the bread of God <br />
is the bread which comes down from heaven <br />
and gives life to the world. </blockquote>

<p>“Sir”, they said, “give us that bread always”. </p>

<p>Jesus answered them:</p>

<blockquote>I am the bread of life. <br />
No one who comes to me will ever hunger; <br />
no one who believes in me will ever thirst. <br />
But, as I have told you, <br />
you can see me and still you do not believe. <br />
Everyone whom the Father gives me will come to me; <br />
I will certainly not reject <br />
anyone who comes to me, <br />
because I have come from heaven, <br />
not to do my own will, <br />
but to do the will of him who sent me. <br />
Now the will of him who sent me <br />
is that I should lose nothing <br />
of all that he has given to me, <br />
but that I should raise it up on the last day. <br />
It is my Father’s will <br />
that whoëver sees the Son and believes in him <br />
should have eternal life, <br />
and that I should raise that person up on the last day. </blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile the Jews were complaining to each other about him, because he had said, “I am the bread that has come down from heaven”. </p>

<p>They were saying, “Surely this is Jesus son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know. How can he now say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?”. </p>

<p>Jesus said in reply to them, “Stop complaining to each other. </p>

<blockquote>No one can come to me <br />
unless drawn by the Father who sent me, <br />
and I will raise that person up on the last day. <br />
It is written in the prophets: <br />
They will all be taught by God; <br />
everyone who has listened to the Father, <br />
and learnt from him, <br />
comes to me. <br />
Not that anybody has seen the Father, <br />
except him who has his being from God: <br />
he has seen the Father. <br />
In all truth I tell you, <br />
everyone who believes has eternal life. <br />
I am the bread of life. <br />
Your fathers ate manna in the desert <br />
and they are dead; <br />
but this is the bread which comes down from heaven, <br />
so that a person may eat it and not die. <br />
I am the living bread which has come down from heaven. <br />
Anyone who eats this bread will live for ever; <br />
and the bread that I shall give <br />
is my flesh, for the life of the world. </blockquote>

<p>Then the Jews started arguing among themselves, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”. </p>

<p>Jesus replied to them: </p>

<blockquote>In all truth I tell you, <br />
if you do not eat the flesh of the Son of man <br />
and drink his blood, <br />
you have no life in you. <br />
Anyone who does eat my flesh and drink my blood <br />
has eternal life, <br />
and I shall raise that person up on the last day. <br />
For my flesh is real food <br />
and my blood is real drink. <br />
Whoäver eats my flesh and drinks my blood <br />
lives in me <br />
and I live in that person. <br />
As the living Father sent me <br />
and I draw life from the Father, <br />
so whoëver eats me will also draw life from me. <br />
This is the bread which has come down from heaven; <br />
it is not like the bread our ancestors ate: <br />
they are dead, <br />
but anyone who eats this bread will live for ever. </blockquote>

<p>This is what he taught at Capernaum in the synagogue. After hearing it, many of his followers said, “This is intolerable language. How could anyone accept it?”. </p>

<p>Jesus was aware that his followers were complaining about it and said, “Does this disturb you? What if you should see the Son of man ascend to where he was before? </p>

<blockquote>It is the spirit that gives life, <br />
the flesh has nothing to offer. <br />
The words I have spoken to you are spirit <br />
and they are life. </blockquote>

<p>“But there are some of you who do not believe”. For Jesus knew from the outset who did not believe and who was to betray him. He went on, “This is why I told you that no one could come to me except by the gift of the Father”. After this, many of his disciples went away and accompanied him no more. </p>

<h4>Peter’s profession of faith (6:67–71)</h4>

<p>Then Jesus said to the Twelve, “What about you, do you want to go away too?”. </p>

<p>Simon Peter answered, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the message of eternal life, and we believe; we have come to know that you are the Holy One of God”. </p>

<p>Jesus replied to them, “Did I not choose the Twelve of you? Yet one of you is a devil”. He meant Judas son of Simon Iscariot, since this was the man, one of the Twelve, who was to betray him. </p>

<h3 id="biv">IV: The Feast of Shelters <br />
The Great Rejection (7:1–10:21)</h3>

<h4>Jesus goes up to Jerusalem for the feast and teaches there (7:1–24)</h4>

<p>After this Jesus travelled round Galilee; he could not travel round Judaea, because the Jews were seeking to kill him. </p>

<p>As the Jewish feast of Shelters drew near, his brothers said to him, “Leave this place and go to Judaea, so that your disciples, too, can see the works you are doing; no one who wants to be publicly known acts in secret; if this is what you are doing, you should reveal yourself to the world”. Not even his brothers had faith in him. </p>

<p>Jesus answered, “For me the right time has not come yet, but for you any time is the right time. The world cannot hate you, but it does hate me, because I give evidence that its ways are evil. Go up to the festival yourselves: I am not going to this festival, because for me the time is not ripe yet”. Having said that, he stayed behind in Galilee. </p>

<p>However, after his brothers had left for the festival, he went up as well, not publicly but secretly. At the festival the Jews were on the look-out for him: “Where is he?”. they said. There was a great deal of talk about him in the crowds. </p>

<p>Some said, “He is a good man”; others, “No, he is leading the people astray”. Yet no one spoke about him openly, for fear of the Jews. </p>

<p>When the festival was half over, Jesus went to the Temple and began to teach. The Jews were astonished and said, “How did he learn to read? He has not been educated”. </p>

<p>Jesus answered them: </p>

<blockquote>My teaching is not from myself: <br />
it comes from the one who sent me; <br />
anyone who is prepared to do his will, <br />
will know whether my teaching is from God <br />
or whether I speak on my own account. <br />
When someone speaks on his own account, <br />
he is seeking honour for himself; <br />
but when he is seeking the honour of the person who sent him, <br />
then he is true <br />
and altogether without dishonesty. <br />
Did not Moses give you the Law? <br />
And yet not one of you keeps the Law! </blockquote>

<p>“Why do you want to kill me?”.</p>

<p>The crowd replied, “You are mad! Who wants to kill you?”. </p>

<p>Jesus answered, “One work I did, and you are all amazed at it. Moses ordered you to practise circumcision — not that it began with him, it goes back to the patriarchs — and you circumcise on the Sabbath. Now if someone can be circumcised on the Sabbath so that the Law of Moses is not broken, why are you angry with me for making someone completely healthy on a Sabbath? Do not keep judging according to appearances; let your judgement be according to what is right”. </p>

<h4>The people discuss the origin of the Messiah (7:25–30)</h4>

<p>Meanwhile some of the people of Jerusalem were saying, “Isn’t this the man they want to kill? And here he is, speaking openly, and they have nothing to say to him! Can it be true the authorities have recognised that he is the Christ? Yet we all know where he comes from, but when the Christ appears no one will know where he comes from”. </p>

<p>Then, as Jesus was teaching in the Temple, he cried out: </p>

<blockquote>You know me and you know where I came from. <br />
Yet I have not come of my own accord: <br />
but he who sent me is true; <br />
You do not know him, <br />
but I know him <br />
because I have my being from him <br />
and it was he who sent me. </blockquote>

<p>They wanted to arrest him then, but because his hour had not yet come no one laid a hand on him. </p>

<h4>Jesus foretells his approaching departure (7:31–36)</h4>

<p>There were many people in the crowds, however, who believed in him; they were saying, “When the Christ comes, will he give more signs than this man has?”. Hearing that talk like this about him was spreading among the people, the Pharisees sent the Temple guards to arrest him. </p>

<p>Then Jesus said: </p>

<blockquote>For a short time I am with you still; <br />
then I shall go back to the one who sent me. <br />
You will look for me and will not find me; <br />
where I am you cannot come. </blockquote>

<p>So the Jews said to one another, “Where is he intending to go that we shall not be able to find him? Is he intending to go abroad to the people who are dispersed among the Greeks and to teach the Greeks? What does he mean when he says: </p>

<blockquote>You will look for me and will not find me; <br />
where I am, you cannot come?</blockquote>

<h4>The promise of living water (7:37–39)</h4>

<p>On the last day, the great day of the festival, Jesus stood and cried out:</p>

<blockquote>
Let anyone who is thirsty come to me! <br />
Let anyone who believes in me come and drink!</blockquote>

<p>As scripture says, “From his heart shall flow streams of living water”. </p>

<p>He was speaking of the Spirit which those who believed in him were to receive; for there was no Spirit as yet because Jesus had not yet been glorified. </p>

<h4>Fresh discussion on the origin of the Messiah (7:40–52)</h4>

<p>Some of the crowd who had been listening said, “He is indeed the prophet”, and some said, “He is the Christ”, but others said, “Would the Christ come from Galilee? Does not scripture say that the Christ must be descended from David and come from Bethlehem, the village where David was?”. So the people could not agree about him. Some wanted to arrest him, but no one actually laid a hand on him. </p>

<p>The guards went back to the chief priests and Pharisees who said to them, “Why haven’t you brought him?”. </p>

<p>The guards replied, “No one has ever spoken like this man”. </p>

<p>“So”, the Pharisees answered, “you, too, have been led astray? Have any of the authorities come to believe in him? Any of the Pharisees? This rabble knows nothing about the Law — they are damned”. </p>

<p>One of them, Nicodemus — the same man who had come to Jesus earlier — said to them, “But surely our Law does not allow us to pass judgement on anyone without first giving him a hearing and discovering what he is doing?”. </p>

<p>To this they answered, “Are you a Galilean too? Go into the matter, and see for yourself: prophets do not arise in Galilee”. </p>

<h4>The adulterous woman (7:53–8:11)</h4>

<p>They all went home, and Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. </p>

<p>At daybreak he appeared in the Temple again; and as all the people came to him, he sat down and began to teach them. </p>

<p>The scribes and Pharisees brought a woman along who had been caught committing adultery; and making her stand there in the middle they said to Jesus, “Master, this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery, and in the Law Moses has ordered us to stone women of this kind. What have you got to say?”. They asked him this as a test, looking for an accusation to use against him. But Jesus bent down and started writing on the ground with his finger. </p>

<p>As they persisted with their question, he straightened up and said, “Let the one among you who is guiltless be the first to throw a stone at her”. Then he bent down and continued writing on the ground. When they heard this they went away one by one, beginning with the eldest, until the last one had gone and Jesus was left alone with the woman, who remained in the middle. Jesus again straightened up and said, “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?”. </p>

<p>“No one, sir”, she replied. </p>

<p>“Neither do I condemn you”, said Jesus. “Go away, and from this moment sin 
no more”. </p>

<h4>Jesus the light of the world (8:12)</h4>

<p>When Jesus spoke to the people again, he said: </p>

<blockquote>I am the light of the world; <br />
anyone who follows me will not be walking in the dark, 
<br />but will have the light of life. </blockquote>

<h4>A discussion on the testimony of Jesus to himself (8:13–30)</h4>

<p>At this the Pharisees said to him, “You are testifying on your own behalf; your testimony is not true”. </p>

<p>Jesus replied: </p>

<blockquote>Even though I am testifying on my own behalf, <br />
my testimony is still true, <br />
because I know <br />
where I have come from and where I am going; <br />
but you do not know where I come from or where I am going. <br />
You judge by human standards; <br />
I judge no one, <br />
but if I judge, <br />
my judgement will be true, <br />
because I am not alone: <br />
the one who sent me is with me; <br />
and in your Law it is written <br />
that the testimony of two witnesses is true. <br />
I testify on my own behalf, <br />
but the Father who sent me testifies on my behalf, too. </blockquote>

<p>They asked him, “Where is your Father then?”. </p>

<p>Jesus answered: </p>

<blockquote>You do not know me, nor do you know my Father; <br />
if you did know me, you would know my Father as well. </blockquote>

<p>He spoke these words in the Treasury, while teaching in the Temple. No one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come. </p>

<p>Again he said to them: </p>

<blockquote>I am going away; you will look for me <br />
and you will die in your sin. <br />
Where I am going, you cannot come. </blockquote>

<p>So the Jews said to one another, “Is he going to kill himself, that he says, ‘Where I am going, you cannot come’?”. </p>

<p>Jesus went on: </p>

<blockquote>You are from below; <br />
I am from above. <br />
You are of this world; <br />
I am not of this world. <br />
I have told you already: You will die in your sins. <br />
Yes, if you do not believe that I am He, <br />
you will die in your sins. </blockquote>

<p>So they said to him, “Who are you?”. </p>

<p>Jesus answered: </p>

<blockquote>What I have told you from the outset. <br />
About you I have much to say <br />
and much to judge; <br />
but the one who sent me is true, <br />
and what I declare to the world <br />
I have learnt from him. </blockquote>

<p>They did not recognise that he was talking to them about the Father. </p>

<p>So Jesus said: </p>

<blockquote>When you have lifted up the Son of man, <br />
then you will know that I am He <br />
and that I do nothing of my own accord. <br />
What I say is what the Father has taught me; <br />
he who sent me is with me, <br />
and has not left me to myself, <br />
for I always do what pleases him. </blockquote>

<p>As he was saying this, many came to believe in him. </p>

<h4>Jesus and Abraham (8:31–59)</h4>

<p>To the Jews who believed in him Jesus said: </p>

<blockquote>If you make my word your home <br />
you will indeed be my disciples; <br />
you will come to know the truth, <br />
and the truth will set you free. </blockquote>

<p>They answered, “We are descended from Abraham and we have never been the slaves of anyone; what do you mean, ‘You will be set free?’. </p>

<p>Jesus replied: </p>

<blockquote>In all truth I tell you, <br />
everyone who commits sin is a slave. <br />
Now a slave has no permanent standing in the household, <br />
but a son belongs to it for ever. <br />
So if the Son sets you free, <br />
you will indeed be free. <br />
I know that you are descended from Abraham; <br />
but you want to kill me <br />
because my word finds no place in you. <br />
What I speak of <br />
is what I have seen at my Father’s side, <br />
and you too put into action <br />
the lessons you have learnt from your father. </blockquote>

<p>They repeated, “Our father is Abraham”. </p>

<p>Jesus said to them: </p>

<blockquote>If you are Abraham’s children, <br />
do as Abraham did. <br />
As it is, you want to kill me, <br />
a man who has told you the truth <br />
as I have learnt it from God; <br />
that is not what Abraham did. <br />
You are doing your father’s work. </blockquote>

<p>They replied, “We were not born illegitimate, the only father we have is God”. </p>

<p>Jesus answered: </p>

<blockquote>If God were your father, you would love me, <br />
since I have my origin in God and have come from him; <br />
I did not come of my own accord, <br />
but he sent me. <br />
Why do you not understand what I say? <br />
Because you cannot bear to listen to my words. <br />
You are from your father, the devil, <br />
and you prefer to do <br />
what your father wants. <br />
He was a murderer from the start; <br />
he was never grounded in the truth; <br />
there is no truth in him at all. <br />
When he lies <br />
he is speaking true to his nature, <br />
because he is a liar, <br />
and the father of lies. <br />
But it is because I speak the truth <br />
that you do not believe me. <br />
Can any of you convict me of sin? <br />
If I speak the truth, why do you not believe me? <br />
Whoëver comes from God <br />
listens to the words of God; <br />
the reason why you do not listen <br />
is that you are not from God. </blockquote>

<p>The Jews replied, “Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and possessed by a devil?”. </p>

<p>Jesus answered: </p>

<blockquote>I am not possessed; <br />
but I honour my Father, <br />
and you deny me honour. <br />
I do not seek my own glory; <br />
there is someone who does seek it and is the judge of it. <br />
In all truth I tell you, <br />
whoëver keeps my word <br />
will never see death. </blockquote>

<p>The Jews said, “Now we know that you are possessed. Abraham is dead, and the prophets are dead, and yet you say, ‘Whoëver keeps my word will never know the taste of death’. Are you greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? The prophets are dead too. Who are you claiming to be?”. </p>

<p>Jesus answered: </p>

<blockquote>If I were to seek my own glory <br />
my glory would be worth nothing; <br />
in fact, my glory is conferred by the Father, <br />
by the one of whom you say, “He is our God”, <br />
although you do not know him. <br />
But I know him, <br />
and if I were to say, “I do not know him”, <br />
I should be a liar, as you yourselves are. <br />
But I do know him, and I keep his word. <br />
Your father Abraham rejoiced <br />
to think that he would see my Day; <br />
he saw it and was glad. </blockquote>

<p>The Jews then said, “You are not fifty yet, and you have seen Abraham!”. </p>

<p>Jesus replied: </p>

<blockquote>In all truth I tell you, <br />
before Abraham ever was, <br />
I am. </blockquote>

<p>At this they picked up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid himself and left the Temple. </p>

<h4>The cure of a man born blind (9:1–41)</h4>

<p>As he went along, he saw a man who had been blind from birth. His disciples asked him, “<i>Rabbi</i>, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he should have been born blind?”. </p>

<p>“Neither he nor his parents sinned”, Jesus answered, “he was born blind so that the works of God might be revealed in him. </p>

<blockquote>As long as day lasts <br />
we must carry out the work of the one who sent me; <br />
the night will soon be here when no one can work. <br />
As long as I am in the world <br />
I am the light of the world. </blockquote>

<p>Having said this, he spat on the ground, made a paste with the spittle, put this over the eyes of the blind man, and said to him, “Go and wash in the Pool of Siloam” (the name means ‘one who has been sent’). So he went off and washed and came back able to see. </p>

<p>His neighbours and the people who used to see him before (for he was a beggar) said, “Isn’t this the man who used to sit and beg?”. </p>

<p>Some said, “Yes, it is the same one”. </p>

<p>Others said, “No, but he looks just like him”. </p>

<p>The man himself said, “Yes, I am the one”. </p>

<p>So they said to him, “Then how is it that your eyes were opened?”. </p>

<p>He answered, “The man called Jesus made a paste, daubed my eyes with it and said to me, ‘Go off and wash at Siloam’; so I went, and when I washed I gained my sight”. </p>

<p>They asked, “Where is he?”. </p>

<p>He answered, “I don’t know”. </p>

<p>They brought to the Pharisees the man who had been blind. It had been a Sabbath day when Jesus made the paste and opened the man’s eyes, so when the Pharisees asked him how he had gained his sight, he said, “He put a paste on my eyes, and I washed, and I can see”. </p>

<p>Then some of the Pharisees said, “That man cannot be from God: he does not keep the Sabbath”. </p>

<p>Others said, “How can a sinner produce signs like this?”. And there was division among them. </p>

<p>So they spoke to the blind man again, “What have you to say about him yourself, now that he has opened your eyes?”. </p>

<p>The man answered, “He is a prophet”. </p>

<p>However, the Jews would not believe that the man had been blind without first sending for the parents of the man who had gained his sight and asking them, “Is this man really the son of yours who you say was born blind? If so, how is it that he is now able to see?”. </p>

<p>His parents answered, “We know he is our son and we know he was born blind, but how he can see, we don’t know, nor who opened his eyes. Ask him. He is old enough: let him speak for himself”. His parents spoke like this out of fear of the Jews, who had already agreed to ban from the synagogue anyone who should acknowledge Jesus as the Christ. This was why his parents said, “He is old enough; ask him”. </p>

<p>So the Jews sent for the man again and said to him, “Give glory to God! We are satisfied that this man is a sinner”. </p>

<p>The man answered, “Whether he is a sinner I don’t know; all I know is that I was blind and now I can see”. </p>

<p>They said to him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”. </p>

<p>He replied, “I have told you once and you wouldn’t listen. Why do you want to hear it all again? Do you want to become his disciples yourselves?”. </p>

<p>At this they hurled abuse at him, “It is you who are his disciple, we are disciples of Moses: we know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this man, we don’t know where he comes from”. </p>

<p>The man replied, “That is just what is so amazing! You don’t know where he comes from and he has opened my eyes! We know that God doesn’t listen to sinners, but God does listen to people who are devout and do his will. Ever since the world began it is unheard of for anyone to open the eyes of someone born blind; if this man were not from God, he wouldn’t have been able to do anything”. </p>

<p>They retorted, “Are you trying to teach us, and you a sinner through and through ever since you were born!”. And they ejected him. </p>

<p>Jesus heard they had ejected him, and when he found him he said to him, “Do you believe in the Son of man?”. </p>

<p>“Sir”, the man replied, “tell me who he is so that I may believe in him”. </p>

<p>Jesus said, “You have seen him; he is speaking to you”. </p>

<p>The man said, “Lord, I believe”, and worshipped him. </p>

<p>Jesus said: </p>

<blockquote>It is for judgement <br />
that I have come into this world, <br />
so that those without sight may see <br />
and those with sight may become blind. </blockquote>

<p>Hearing this, some Pharisees who were present said to him, “So we are blind, are we?”. </p>

<p>Jesus replied: </p>

<blockquote>If you were blind, <br />
you would not be guilty, <br />
but since you say, “We can see”, <br />
your guilt remains. </blockquote>

<h4>The good shepherd (10:1–21)</h4>

<p>“In all truth I tell you, anyone who does not enter the sheepfold through the gate, but climbs in some other way, is a thief and a bandit. He who enters through the gate is the shepherd of the flock; the gatekeeper lets him in, the sheep hear his voice, one by one he calls his own sheep and leads them out. When he has brought out all those that are his, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow because they know his voice. They will never follow a stranger, but will run away from him because they do not recognise the voice of strangers”. </p>

<p>Jesus told them this parable but they failed to understand what he was saying to them. </p>

<p>So Jesus spoke to them again: </p>

<blockquote>In all truth I tell you, <br />
I am the gate of the sheepfold. <br />
All who have come before me <br />
are thieves and bandits, <br />
but the sheep took no notice of them. <br />
I am the gate. <br />
Anyone who enters through me will be safe: <br />
such a one will go in and out <br />
and will find pasture. <br />
The thief comes <br />
only to steal and kill and destroy. <br />
I have come <br />
so that they may have life <br />
and have it to the full. <br />
I am the good shepherd: <br />
the good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep. <br />
The hired man, since he is not the shepherd <br />
and the sheep do not belong to him, <br />
abandons the sheep <br />
as soon as he sees a wolf coming, and runs away, <br />
and then the wolf attacks and scatters the sheep; <br />
he runs away because he is only a hired man <br />
and has no concern for the sheep. <br />
I am the good shepherd; <br />
I know my own <br />
and my own know me, <br />
just as the Father knows me <br />
and I know the Father; <br />
and I lay down my life for my sheep. <br />
And there are other sheep I have <br />
that are not of this fold, <br />
and I must lead these too. <br />
They too will listen to my voice, <br />
and there will be only one flock, <br />
one shepherd. <br />
The Father loves me, <br />
because I lay down my life <br />
in order to take it up again. <br />
No one takes it from me; <br />
I lay it down of my own free will, <br />
and as I have power to lay it down, <br />
so I have power to take it up again; <br />
and this is the command I have received from my Father. </blockquote>

<p>These words caused a fresh division among the Jews. Many said, “He is possessed, he is raving; why do you listen to him?”. </p>

<p>Others said, “These are not the words of a man possessed by a devil: could a devil open the eyes of the blind?”. </p>

<h3 id="bv">V: The Feast of Dedication <br />
The Decision to Kill Jesus (10:22–42)</h3>

<h4>Jesus claims to be the Son of God (10:22–30)</h4>

<p>It was the time of the feast of Dedication in Jerusalem. It was winter, and Jesus was in the Temple walking up and down in the Portico of Solomon. The Jews gathered round him and said, “How much longer are you going to keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us openly”. </p>

<p>Jesus replied: </p>

<blockquote>I have told you, but you do not believe. <br />
The works I do in my Father’s name are my witness; <br />
but you do not believe, <br />
because you are no sheep of mine. <br />
The sheep that belong to me listen to my voice; <br />
I know them and they follow me. <br />
I give them eternal life; <br />
they will never be lost <br />
and no one will ever steal them from my hand. <br />
The Father, for what he has given me, is greater than anyone, <br />
and no one can steal anything from the Father’s hand. <br />
The Father and I are one. </blockquote>

<p>The Jews fetched stones to stone him, so Jesus said to them, “I have shown you many good works from my Father; for which of these are you stoning me?”. </p>

<p>The Jews answered him, “We are stoning you, not for doing a good work, but for blasphemy; though you are only a man, you claim to be God”. </p>

<p>Jesus answered: </p>

<blockquote>Is it not written in your Law: <br />
I said, you are gods? 
So it uses the word ‘gods’  <br />
of those people to whom the word of God was addressed <br />
— and scripture cannot be set aside. <br />
Yet to someone whom the Father has consecrated <br />
and sent into the world you say, <br />
“You are blaspheming”, <br />
because I said, “I am Son of God”. <br />
If I am not doing my Father’s work, <br />
there is no need to believe me; <br />
but if I am doing it, <br />
then even if you refuse to believe in me, <br />
at least believe in the work I do; <br />
then you will know for certain <br />
that the Father is in me and I am in the Father. </blockquote>

<p>They again wanted to arrest him then, but he eluded their clutches. </p>

<h4>Jesus withdraws to the other side of the Jordan (10:40–42)</h4>

<p>He went back again to the far side of the Jordan to the district where John had been baptising at first and he stayed there. Many people who came to him said, “John gave no signs, but all he said about this man was true”; and many of them believed in him. </p>

<h3 id="bvi">VI: Jesus Moves Towards his Death (11:1–12:50)</h3>

<h4>The resurrection of Lazarus (11:1–44)</h4>

<p>There was a man named Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister, Martha, and he was ill. It was the same Mary, the sister of the sick man Lazarus, who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair. The sisters sent this message to Jesus, “Lord, the man you love is ill”. </p>

<p>On receiving the message, Jesus said, “This sickness will not end in death, but it is for God’s glory so that through it the Son of God may be glorified”. </p>

<p>Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus, yet when he heard that he was ill he stayed where he was for two more days before saying to the disciples, “Let us go back to Judaea”. </p>

<p>The disciples said, “Rabbi, it is not long since the Jews were trying to stone you; are you going back there again?”. </p>

<p>Jesus replied: </p>

<blockquote>Are there not twelve hours in the day? <br />
No one who walks in the daytime stumbles, <br />
having the light of this world to see by; <br />
anyone who walks around at night stumbles, <br />
having no light as a guide. </blockquote>

<p>He said that and then added, “Our friend Lazarus is at rest; I am going to wake him”. </p>

<p>The disciples said to him, “Lord, if he is at rest he will be saved”. </p>

<p>Jesus was speaking of the death of Lazarus, but they thought that by ‘rest’ he meant ‘sleep’; so Jesus put it plainly, “Lazarus is dead; and for your sake I am glad I was not there because now you will believe. But let us go to him”. </p>

<p>Then Thomas — known as the Twin — said to the other disciples, “Let us also go to die with him”. </p>

<p>On arriving, Jesus found that Lazarus had been in the tomb for four days already. Bethany is only about two miles from Jerusalem, and many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them about their brother. When Martha heard that Jesus was coming she went to meet him. Mary remained sitting in the house. Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died, but even now I know that God will grant whatever you ask of him”. </p>

<p>Jesus said to her, “Your brother will rise again”. </p>

<p>Martha said, “I know he will rise again at the resurrection on the last day”. </p>

<p>Jesus said: </p>

<blockquote>I am the resurrection. <br />
Anyone who believes in me, even though that person dies, will live, <br />
and whoëver lives and believes in me <br />
will never die. <br />
Do you believe this? </blockquote>

<p>“Yes, Lord”, she said, “I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, the one who was to come into this world”. </p>

<p>When she had said this, she went and called her sister Mary, saying in a low voice, “The Master is here and wants to see you”. Hearing this, Mary got up quickly and went to him. Jesus had not yet come into the village; he was still at the place where Martha had met him. When the Jews who were in the house comforting Mary saw her get up so quickly and go out, they followed her, thinking that she was going to the tomb to weep there. </p>

<p>Mary went to Jesus, and as soon as she saw him she threw herself at his feet, saying, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died”. </p>

<p>At the sight of her tears, and those of the Jews who had come with her, Jesus was greatly distressed, and with a profound sigh he said, “Where have you put him?”. </p>

<p>They said, “Lord, come and see”. </p>

<p>Jesus wept; and the Jews said, “See how much he loved him!”. </p>

<p>But there were some who remarked, “He opened the eyes of the blind man. Could he not have prevented this man’s death?”. Sighing again, Jesus reached the tomb: it was a cave with a stone to close the opening. </p>

<p>Jesus said, “Take the stone away”. </p>

<p>Martha, the dead man’s sister, said to him, “Lord, by now he will smell; this is the fourth day since he died”. </p>

<p>Jesus replied, “Have I not told you that if you believe you will see the glory of God?”. So they took the stone away. Then Jesus lifted up his eyes and said: </p>

<blockquote>Father, I thank you for hearing my prayer. <br />
I myself knew that you hear me always, <br />
but I speak <br />
for the sake of all these who are standing around me, <br />
so that they may believe it was you who sent me. </blockquote>

<p>When he had said this, he cried in a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!”. The dead man came out, his feet and hands bound with strips of material, and a cloth over his face. Jesus said to them, “Unbind him, let him go free”. </p>

<h4>The Jewish leaders decide on the death of Jesus (11:45–54)</h4>

<p>Many of the Jews who had come to visit Mary, and had seen what he did, believed in him, but some of them went to the Pharisees to tell them what Jesus had done. Then the chief priests and Pharisees called a meeting. “Here is this man working all these signs”, they said, “and what action are we taking? If we let him go on in this way everybody will believe in him, and the Romans will come and suppress the Holy Place and our nation”. </p>

<p>One of them, Caiaphas, the high priest that year, said, “You do not seem to have grasped the situation at all; you fail to see that it is to your advantage that one man should die for the people, rather than that the whole nation should perish”. He did not speak in his own person, but as high priest of that year he was prophesying that Jesus was to die for the nation — and not for the nation only, but also to gather together into one the scattered children of God. From that day onwards they were determined to kill him. So Jesus no longer went about openly among the Jews, but left the district for a town called Ephraim, in the country bordering on the desert, and stayed there with his disciples. </p>

<h4>The passover draws near (11:55–57)</h4>

<p>The Jewish Passover was drawing near, and many of the country people who had gone up to Jerusalem before the Passover to purify themselves were looking out for Jesus, saying to one another as they stood about in the Temple, “What do you think? Will he come to the festival or not?”. The chief priests and Pharisees had by now given their orders: anyone who knew where he was must inform them so that they could arrest him. </p>

<h4>The anointing at Bethany (12:1–11)</h4>

<p>Six days before the Passover, Jesus went to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom he had raised from the dead. They gave a dinner for him there; Martha waited on them and Lazarus was among those at table. Mary brought in a pound of very costly ointment, pure nard, and with it anointed the feet of Jesus, wiping them with her hair; the house was filled with the scent of the ointment. Then Judas Iscariot — one of his disciples, the man who was to betray him — said, “Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor?”. He said this, not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief; he was in charge of the common fund and used to help himself to the contents. </p>

<p>So Jesus said, “Leave her alone; let her keep it for the day of my burial. You have the poor with you always, you will not always have me”. </p>

<p>Meanwhile a large number of Jews heard that he was there and came not only on account of Jesus but also to see Lazarus whom he had raised from the dead. Then the chief priests decided to kill Lazarus as well, since it was on his account that many of the Jews were leaving them and believing in Jesus. </p>

<h4>The <i>Messiah</i> enters Jerusalem (12:12–19)</h4>

<p>The next day the great crowd of people who had come up for the festival heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. They took branches of palm and went out to receive him, shouting: </p>

<blockquote>Hosanna! <br />
Blessed is he who is coming in the name of the Lord, <br />
the king of Israel. </blockquote>

<p>Jesus found a young donkey and mounted it — as scripture says: </p>

<blockquote>Do not be afraid, daughter of Zion; <br />
look, your king is approaching, <br />
riding on the foal of a donkey. </blockquote>

<p>At first his disciples did not understand this, but later, after Jesus had been glorified, they remembered that this had been written about him and that this was what had happened to him. The crowd who had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead kept bearing witness to it; this was another reason why the crowd came out to receive him: they had heard that he had given this sign. Then the Pharisees said to one another, “You see, you are making no progress; look, the whole world 
has gone after him!”. </p>

<h4>Jesus foretells his death and subsequent glorification (12:20–36)</h4>

<p>Among those who went up to worship at the festival were some Greeks. These approached Philip, who came from Bethsaida in Galilee, and put this request to him, “Sir, we should like to see Jesus”. Philip went to tell Andrew, and Andrew and Philip together went to tell Jesus. </p>

<p>Jesus replied to them: </p>

<blockquote>Now the hour has come <br />
for the Son of man to be glorified. <br />
In all truth I tell you, <br />
unless a wheat grain falls into the earth and dies, <br />
it remains only a single grain; <br />
but if it dies <br />
it yields a rich harvest. <br />
Anyone who loves his life loses it; <br />
anyone who hates his life in this world <br />
will keep it for eternal life. <br />
Whoëver serves me, must follow me, <br />
and my servant will be with me wherever I am. <br />
If anyone serves me, my Father will honour him. <br />
Now my soul is troubled. <br />
What shall I say: <br />
Father, save me from this hour? <br />
But it is for this very reason that I have come to this hour. <br />
Father, glorify your name! </blockquote>

<p>A voice came from heaven, “I have glorified it, and I will again glorify it”. </p>

<p>The crowd standing by, who heard this, said it was a clap of thunder; others said, “It was an angel speaking to him”. </p>

<p>Jesus answered, “It was not for my sake that this voice came, but for yours. </p>

<blockquote>Now sentence is being passed on this world; <br />
now the prince of this world is to be driven out. <br />
And when I am lifted up from the earth, <br />
I shall draw all people to myself. </blockquote>

<p>By these words he indicated the kind of death he would die. The crowd answered, “The Law has taught us that the Christ will remain for ever. So how can you say, ‘The Son of man must be lifted up’? Who is this Son of man?”. </p>

<p>Jesus then said: </p>

<blockquote>The light will be with you only a little longer now. <br />
Go on your way while you have the light, <br />
or darkness will overtake you, <br />
and nobody who walks in the dark knows where he is going. <br />
While you still have the light, <br />
believe in the light <br />
so that you may become children of light. </blockquote>

<p>Having said this, Jesus left them and was hidden from their sight. </p>

<h4>Conclusion: the unbelief of the Jews (12:37–50)</h4>

<p>Though they had been present when he gave so many signs, they did not believe in him; this was to fulfil the words of the prophet Isaiah: </p>

<blockquote>Lord, who has given credence to what they have heard from us, <br />
and who has seen in it a revelation of the Lord’s arm? </blockquote>

<p>Indeed, they were unable to believe because, as Isaiah says again: </p>

<blockquote>He has blinded their eyes, <br />
he has hardened their heart, <br />
to prevent them from using their eyes to see, <br />
using their heart to understand, <br />
changing their ways and being healed by me. </blockquote>

<p>Isaiah said this because he saw his glory, and his words referred to Jesus. </p>

<p>And yet there were many who did believe in him, even among the leading men, but they did not admit it, because of the Pharisees and for fear of being banned from the synagogue: they put human glory before God’s glory. </p>

<p>Jesus declared publicly: </p>

<blockquote>Whoëver believes in me <br />
believes not in me <br />
but in the one who sent me, <br />
and whoëver sees me, <br />
sees the one who sent me. <br />
I have come into the world as light, <br />
to prevent anyone who believes in me <br />
from staying in the dark any more. <br />
If anyone hears my words and does not keep them faithfully, <br />
it is not I who shall judge such a person, <br />
since I have come not to judge the world, <br />
but to save the world: <br />
anyone who rejects me and refuses my words <br />
has his judge already: <br />
the word itself that I have spoken <br />
will be his judge on the last day. <br />
For I have not spoken of my own accord; <br />
but the Father who sent me <br />
commanded me what to say and what to speak, <br />
and I know that his commands mean eternal life. <br />
And therefore what the Father has told me <br />
is what I speak. </blockquote>

<h2 id="c">C: Jesus’ Hour Comes (13:1–20:31)</h2>

<h3>The Passover of the Lamb of God</h3>

<h3 id="ci">I: Jesus’ Last Meal with His Disciples (13:1–17:26)</h3>

<h4>The washing of feet (13:1–20)</h4>

<p>Before the festival of the Passover, Jesus, knowing that his hour had come to pass from this world to the Father, having loved those who were his in the world, loved them to the end. </p>

<p>They were at supper, and the devil had already put it into the mind of Judas Iscariot son of Simon, to betray him. Jesus knew that the Father had put everything into his hands, and that he had come from God and was returning to God, and he got up from table, removed his outer garments and, taking a towel, wrapped it round his waist; he then poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the towel he was wearing. </p>

<p>He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?”. </p>

<p>Jesus answered, “At the moment you do not know what I am doing, but later you will understand”. </p>

<p>“Never!”, said Peter. “You shall never wash my feet”. Jesus replied, “If I do not wash you, you can have no share with me”. </p>

<p>Simon Peter said, “Well then, Lord, not only my feet, but my hands and my head as well!”. </p>

<p>Jesus said, “No one who has had a bath needs washing, such a person is clean all over. You too are clean, though not all of you are”. He knew who was going to betray him, and that was why he said, “though not all of you are”. </p>

<p>When he had washed their feet and put on his outer garments again he went back to the table. “Do you understand', he said, “what I have done to you? You call me Master and Lord, and rightly; so I am. If I, then, the Lord and Master, have washed your feet, you must wash each other’s feet. I have given you an example so that you may copy what I have done to you. </p>

<blockquote>In all truth I tell you, <br />
no servant is greater than his master, <br />
no messenger is greater than the one who sent him. </blockquote>

<p>“Now that you know this, blessed are you if you behave accordingly. I am not speaking about all of you: I know the ones I have chosen; but what scripture says must be fulfilled: </p>

<blockquote>He who shares my table <br />
takes advantage of me. <br />
I tell you this now, before it happens, <br />
so that when it does happen <br />
you may believe that I am He. <br />
In all truth I tell you, <br />
whoëver welcomes the one I send, welcomes me, <br />
and whoëver welcomes me, welcomes the one who sent me. </blockquote>

<h4>The treachery of Judas foretold (13:20–30)</h4>

<p>Having said this, Jesus was deeply disturbed and declared, “In all truth I tell you, one of you is going to betray me”. The disciples looked at each other, wondering whom he meant. </p>

<p>The disciple Jesus loved was reclining next to Jesus; Simon Peter signed to him and said, “Ask who it is he means”, so leaning back close to Jesus’ chest he said, “Who is it, Lord?”. </p>

<p>Jesus answered, “It is the one to whom I give the piece of bread that I dip in the dish”. And when he had dipped the piece of bread he gave it to Judas son of Simon Iscariot. At that instant, after Judas had taken the bread, Satan entered him. Jesus then said, “What you are going to do, do quickly”. None of the others at table understood why he said this. Since Judas had charge of the common fund, some of them thought Jesus was telling him, “Buy what we need for the festival”, or telling him to give something to the poor. As soon as Judas had taken the piece of bread he went out. It was night. </p>

<h4>Farewell discourses (13:31–14:31)</h4>

<p>When he had gone, Jesus said: </p>

<blockquote>Now has the Son of man been glorified, <br />
and in him God has been glorified. <br />
If God has been glorified in him, <br />
God will in turn glorify him in himself, <br />
and will glorify him very soon. <br />
Little children, <br />
I shall be with you only a little longer. <br />
You will look for me, <br />
and, as I told the Jews, <br />
where I am going, <br />
you cannot come. <br />
I give you a new commandment: <br />
love one another; <br />
you must love one another <br />
just as I have loved you. <br />
It is by your love for one another, <br />
that everyone will recognise you <br />
as my disciples. </blockquote>

<p>Simon Peter said, “Lord, where are you going?”. </p>

<p>Jesus replied, “Now you cannot follow me where I am going, but later you shall follow me”. </p>

<p>Peter said to him, “Why can I not follow you now? I will lay down my life for you”. </p>

<p>“Lay down your life for me?”, answered Jesus. “In all truth I tell you, before the cock crows you will have disowned me three times. </p>

<blockquote>Do not let your hearts be troubled. <br />
You trust in God, trust also in me. <br />
In my Father’s house there are many places to live in; <br />
otherwise I would have told you. <br />
I am going now to prepare a place for you, <br />
and after I have gone and prepared you a place, <br />
I shall return to take you to myself, <br />
so that you may be with me <br />
where I am. <br />
You know the way to the place where I am going.</blockquote>

<p>Thomas said, “Lord, we do not know where you are going, so how can we know the way?”. </p>

<p>Jesus said: </p>

<blockquote>I am the Way; I am Truth and Life. <br />
No one can come to the Father except through me. <br />
If you know me, you will know my Father too. <br />
From this moment you know him and have seen him. </blockquote>

<p>Philip said, “Lord, show us the Father and then we shall be satisfied”. </p>

<p>Jesus said to him, “Have I been with you all this time, Philip, and you still do not know me? </p>

<blockquote>Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father, <br />
so how can you say, “Show us the Father"? <br />
Do you not believe <br />
that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? <br />
What I say to you I do not speak of my own accord: <br />
it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his works. <br />
You must believe me when I say <br />
that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; <br />
or at least believe it on the evidence of these works. <br />
In all truth I tell you, whoëver believes in me <br />
will perform the same works as I do myself, <br />
and will perform even greater works, <br />
because I am going to the Father. <br />
Whatever you ask in my name I will do, <br />
so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. <br />
If you ask me anything in my name, <br />
I will do it. <br />
 If you love me you will keep my commandments. <br />
I shall ask the Father, <br />
and he will give you another Paraclete <br />
to be with you for ever, <br />
the Spirit of truth <br />
whom the world can never accept <br />
since it neither sees nor knows him; <br />
but you know him, <br />
because he is with you, he is in you. <br />
I shall not leave you orphans; <br />
I shall come to you. <br />
In a short time the world will no longer see me; <br />
but you will see that I live <br />
and you also will live. <br />
On that day <br />
you will know that I am in my Father <br />
and you in me and I in you. <br />
Whoëver holds to my commandments and keeps them <br />
is the one who loves me; <br />
and whoëver loves me will be loved by my Father, <br />
and I shall love him and reveal myself to him. </blockquote>

<p>Judas — not Judas Iscariot — said to him, “Lord, what has happened, that you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world?”. </p>

<p>Jesus replied: </p>

<blockquote>Anyone who loves me will keep my word, <br />
and my Father will love him, <br />
and we shall come to him <br />
and make a home in him. <br />
Anyone who does not love me <br />
does not keep my words. <br />
And the word that you hear is not my own: <br />
it is the word of the Father who sent me. <br />
I have said these things to you <br />
while still with you; <br />
but the Paraclete, the Holy Spirit, <br />
whom the Father will send in my name, <br />
will teach you everything <br />
and remind you of all I have said to you. <br />
Peace I bequeath to you, <br />
my own peace I give you, <br />
a peace which the world cannot give, this is my gift to you. <br />
Do not let your hearts be troubled or afraid. <br />
You heard me say: <br />
I am going away and shall return. <br />
If you loved me you would be glad that I am going to the Father, <br />
for the Father is greater than I. <br />
I have told you this now, before it happens, <br />
so that when it does happen you may believe. <br />
I shall not talk to you much longer, <br />
because the prince of this world is on his way. <br />
He has no power over me, <br />
but the world must recognise that I love the Father <br />
and that I act just as the Father commanded. <br />
Come now, let us go. </blockquote>

<h4>The true vine (15:1–17)</h4>

<blockquote>I am the true vine, <br />
and my Father is the vinedresser. <br />
Every branch in me that bears no fruit <br />
he cuts away, <br />
and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes <br />
to make it bear even more. <br />
You are clean already, <br />
by means of the word that I have spoken to you. <br />
Remain in me, as I in you. <br />
As a branch cannot bear fruit all by itself, <br />
unless it remains part of the vine, <br />
neither can you unless you remain in me. <br />
I am the vine, <br />
you are the branches. <br />
Whoëver remains in me, with me in him, <br />
bears fruit in plenty; <br />
for cut off from me you can do nothing. <br />
Anyone who does not remain in me <br />
is thrown away like a branch <br />
— and withers; <br />
these branches are collected and thrown on the fire <br />
and are burnt. <br />
If you remain in me <br />
and my words remain in you, <br />
you may ask for whatever you please <br />
and you will get it. <br />
It is to the glory of my Father that you should bear much fruit <br />
and be my disciples. <br />
I have loved you <br />
just as the Father has loved me. <br />
Remain in my love. <br />
If you keep my commandments <br />
you will remain in my love, <br />
just as I have kept my Father’s commandments <br />
and remain in his love. <br />
I have told you this <br />
so that my own joy may be in you <br />
and your joy be complete. <br />
This is my commandment: <br />
love one another, <br />
as I have loved you. <br />
No one can have greater love <br />
than to lay down his life for his friends. <br />
You are my friends, <br />
if you do what I command you. <br />
I shall no longer call you servants, <br />
because a servant does not know <br />
the master’s business; <br />
I call you friends, <br />
because I have made known to you <br />
everything I have learnt from my Father. <br />
You did not choose me, <br />
no, I chose you; <br />
and I commissioned you <br />
to go out and to bear fruit, <br />
fruit that will last; <br />
so that the Father will give you <br />
anything you ask him in my name. <br />
My command to you <br />
is to love one another. </blockquote>

Joh 15:18 If the world hates you, you must realise that it hated me before it hated you. 

Joh 15:19 If you belonged to the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you do not belong to 
the world, because my choice of you has drawn you out of the world, that is why the world hates you. 

Joh 1 5:20 Remember the words I said to you: A servant is not greater than his master. If they persecuted me, 
they will persecute you too; if they kept my word, they will keep yours as well. 

Joh 1 5:21 But it will be on my account that they will do all this to you, because they do not know the one who 
sent me. 

Joh 15:22 If I had not come, if I had not spoken to them, they would have been blameless; but as it is they have 
no excuse for their sin. 

Joh 15:23 Anyone who hates me hates my Father. 

Joh 15:24 If I had not performed such works among them as no one else has ever done, they would be 
blameless; but as it is, in spite of what they have seen, they hate both me and my Father. 

Joh 15:25 But all this was only to fulfil the words written in their Law: They hated me without reason. 

Joh 1 5:26 When the Paraclete comes, whom I shall send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who issues 
from the Father, he will be my witness. 



Joh 15:27 And you too will be witnesses, because you have been with me from the beginning. 

Joh 16:1 I have told you all this so that you may not fall away. 

Joh 16:2 They will expel you from the synagogues, and indeed the time is coming when anyone who kills you 
will think he is doing a holy service to God. 

Joh 1 6:3 They will do these things because they have never known either the Father or me. 

Joh 1 6:4 But I have told you all this, so that when the time for it comes you may remember that I told you. I did 
not tell you this from the beginning, because I was with you; 

Joh 16:5 but now I am going to the one who sent me. Not one of you asks, “Where are you going?”. 

Joh 16:6 Yet you are sad at heart because I have told you this. 

Joh 16:7 Still, I am telling you the truth: it is for your own good that I am going, because unless I go, the 
Paraclete will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you. 

Joh 16:8 And when he comes, he will show the world how wrong it was, about sin, and about who was in the 

right, and about judgement: 

Joh 16:9 about sin: in that they refuse to believe in me; 

Joh 16:10 about who was in the right: in that I am going to the Father and you will see me no more; 

Joh 16:1 1 about judgement: in that the prince of this world is already condemned. 

Joh 16:12 I still have many things to say to you but they would be too much for you to bear now. 

Joh 16:13 However, when the Spirit of truth comes he will lead you to the complete truth, since he will not be 

speaking of his own accord, but will say only what he has been told; and he will reveal to you the things to come. 
Joh 16:14 He will glorify me, since all he reveals to you will be taken from what is mine. 

Joh 16:15 Everything the Father has is mine; that is why I said: all he reveals to you will be taken from what is 
mine. 

Joh 16:16 In a short time you will no longer see me, and then a short time later you will see me again. 

Joh 16:17 Then some of his disciples said to one another, “What does he mean, “In a short time you will no 

longer see me, and then a short time later you will see me again," and, “I am going to the Father"? 

Joh 16:18 What is this "short time"? We don’t know what he means”. 

Joh 16:19 Jesus knew that they wanted to question him, so he said, “You are asking one another what I meant 
by saying, “In a short time you will no longer see me, and then a short time later you will see me again”. 

Joh 16:20 “In all truth I tell you, you will be weeping and wailing while the world will rejoice; you will be sorrowful, 
but your sorrow will turn to joy. 

Joh 1 6:21 A woman in childbirth suffers, because her time has come; but when she has given birth to the child 
she forgets the suffering in her joy that a human being has been born into the world. 

Joh 16:22 So it is with you: you are sad now, but I shall see you again, and your hearts will be full of joy, and 
that joy no one shall take from you. 

Joh 16:23 When that day comes, you will not ask me any questions. In all truth I tell you, anything you ask from 
the Father he will grant in my name. 

Joh 16:24 Until now you have not asked anything in my name. Ask and you will receive, and so your joy will be 
complete. 

Joh 16:25 I have been telling you these things in veiled language. The hour is coming when I shall no longer 
speak to you in veiled language but tell you about the Father in plain words. 

Joh 1 6:26 When that day comes you will ask in my name; and I do not say that I shall pray to the Father for you, 
Joh 16:27 because the Father himself loves you for loving me, and believing that I came from God. 

Joh 16:28 I came from the Father and have come into the world and now I am leaving the world to go to the 
Father”. 

Joh 16:29 His disciples said, “Now you are speaking plainly and not using veiled language. 

Joh 1 6:30 Now we see that you know everything and need not wait for questions to be put into words; because 
of this we believe that you came from God”. 

Joh 16:31 Jesus answered them: Do you believe at last? 

Joh 16:32 Listen; the time will come — indeed it has come already -- when you are going to be scattered, each 
going his own way and leaving me alone. And yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me. 

Joh 16:33 I have told you all this so that you may find peace in me. In the world you will have hardship, but be 
courageous: I have conquered the world. 

Joh 17:1 After saying this, Jesus raised his eyes to heaven and said: Father, the hour has come: glorify your 
Son so that your Son may glorify you; 

Joh 17:2 so that, just as you have given him power over all humanity, he may give eternal life to all those you 
have entrusted to him. 

Joh 17:3 And eternal life is this: to know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent. 

Joh 17:4 I have glorified you on earth by finishing the work that you gave me to do. 

Joh 17:5 Now, Father, glorify me with that glory I had with you before ever the world existed. 



Joh 17:6 I have revealed your name to those whom you took from the world to give me. They were yours and 
you gave them to me, and they have kept your word. 

Joh 17:7 Now at last they have recognised that all you have given me comes from you 

Joh 17:8 for I have given them the teaching you gave to me, and they have indeed accepted it and know for 

certain that I came from you, and have believed that it was you who sent me. 

Joh 17:9 It is for them that I pray. I am not praying for the world but for those you have given me, because they 
belong to you. 

Joh 17:10 All I have is yours and all you have is mine, and in them I am glorified. 

Joh 17:1 1 I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep 

those you have given me true to your name, so that they may be one like us. 

Joh 17:12 While I was with them, I kept those you had given me true to your name. I have watched over them 

and not one is lost except one who was destined to be lost, and this was to fulfil the scriptures. 

Joh 17:13 But now I am coming to you and I say these things in the world to share my joy with them to the full. 
Joh 17:14 I passed your word on to them, and the world hated them, because they belong to the world no more 
than I belong to the world. 

Joh 17:15 I am not asking you to remove them from the world, but to protect them from the Evil One. 

Joh 17:16 They do not belong to the world any more than I belong to the world. 

Joh 17:17 Consecrate them in the truth; your word is truth. 

Joh 17:18 As you sent me into the world, I have sent them into the world, 

Joh 17:19 and for their sake I consecrate myself so that they too may be consecrated in truth. 

Joh 17:20 I pray not only for these but also for those who through their teaching will come to believe in me. 

Joh 17:21 May they all be one, just as, Father, you are in me and I am in you, so that they also may be in us, so 
that the world may believe it was you who sent me. 

Joh 17:22 I have given them the glory you gave to me, that they may be one as we are one. 

Joh 17:23 With me in them and you in me, may they be so perfected in unity that the world will recognise that it 
was you who sent me and that you have loved them as you have loved me. 

Joh 17:24 Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am, so that they may always see my 
glory which you have given me because you loved me before the foundation of the world. 

Joh 17:25 Father, Upright One, the world has not known you, but I have known you, and these have known that 
you have sent me. 

Joh 17:26 I have made your name known to them and will continue to make it known, so that the love with 
which you loved me may be in them, and so that I may be in them. 

Joh 18:1 After he had said all this, Jesus left with his disciples and crossed the Kidron valley where there was a 
garden into which he went with his disciples. 

Joh 18:2 Judas the traitor knew the place also, since Jesus had often met his disciples there, 

Joh 1 8:3 so Judas brought the cohort to this place together with guards sent by the chief priests and the 
Pharisees, all with lanterns and torches and weapons. 

Joh 18:4 Knowing everything that was to happen to him, Jesus came forward and said, “Who are you looking 
for?”. 

Joh 18:5 They answered, “Jesus the Nazarene”. He said, “I am he”. Now Judas the traitor was standing among 
them. 

Joh 18:6 When Jesus said to them, “I am he”, they moved back and fell on the ground. 

Joh 18:7 He asked them a second time, “Who are you looking for?”. They said, “Jesus the Nazarene”. 

Joh 18:8 Jesus replied, “I have told you that I am he. If I am the one you are looking for, let these others go”. 

Joh 18:9 This was to fulfil the words he had spoken, “Not one of those you gave me have I lost”. 

Joh 18:10 Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest’s servant, cutting off his right ear. 
The servant’s name was Malchus. 

Joh 18:1 1 Jesus said to Peter, “Put your sword back in its scabbard; am I not to drink the cup that the Father 
has given me?”. 

Joh 18:12 The cohort and its tribune and the Jewish guards seized Jesus and bound him. 

Joh 18:13 They took him first to Annas, because Annas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest 
that year. 

Joh 18:14 It was Caiaphas who had counselled the Jews, “It is better for one man to die for the people”. 

Joh 18:15 Simon Peter, with another disciple, followed Jesus. This disciple, who was known to the high priest, 
went with Jesus into the high priest’s palace, 

Joh 18:16 but Peter stayed outside the door. So the other disciple, the one known to the high priest, went out, 
spoke to the door-keeper and brought Peter in. 

Joh 18:17 The girl on duty at the door said to Peter, “Aren’t you another of that man’s disciples?”. He answered, “I 
am not”. 



Joh 18:18 Now it was cold, and the servants and guards had lit a charcoal fire and were standing there warming 
themselves; so Peter stood there too, warming himself with the others. 

Joh 18:19 The high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and his teaching. 

Joh 18:20 Jesus answered, “I have spoken openly for all the world to hear; I have always taught in the 
synagogue and in the Temple where all the Jews meet together; I have said nothing in secret. 

Joh 1 8:21 Why ask me? Ask my hearers what I taught; they know what I said”. 

Joh 18:22 At these words, one of the guards standing by gave Jesus a slap in the face, saying, “Is that the way 
you answer the high priest?”. 

Joh 18:23 Jesus replied, “If there is some offence in what I said, point it out; but if not, why do you strike me?”. 
Joh 18:24 Then Annas sent him, bound, to Caiaphas the high priest. 

Joh 18:25 As Simon Peter stood there warming himself, someone said to him, “Aren’t you another of his 
disciples?”. He denied it saying, “I am not”. 

Joh 18:26 One of the high priest’s servants, a relation of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, “Didn’t I see 
you in the garden with him?”. 

Joh 18:27 Again Peter denied it; and at once a cock crowed. 

Joh 18:28 They then led Jesus from the house of Caiaphas to the Praetorium. It was now morning. They did not 
go into the Praetorium themselves to avoid becoming defiled and unable to eat the Passover. 

Joh 1 8:29 So Pilate came outside to them and said, “What charge do you bring against this man?”. They replied, 
Joh 1 8:30 “If he were not a criminal, we should not have handed him over to you”. 

Joh 18:31 Pilate said, “Take him yourselves, and try him by your own Law”. The Jews answered, “We are not 
allowed to put anyone to death”. 

Joh 18:32 This was to fulfil the words Jesus had spoken indicating the way he was going to die. 

Joh 18:33 So Pilate went back into the Praetorium and called Jesus to him and asked him, “Are you the king of 
the Jews?”. 

Joh 1 8:34 Jesus replied, “Do you ask this of your own accord, or have others said it to you about me?”. 

Joh 18:35 Pilate answered, “Am I a Jew? It is your own people and the chief priests who have handed you over 
to me: what have you done?”. 

Joh 1 8:36 Jesus replied, “Mine is not a kingdom of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, my men would 
have fought to prevent my being surrendered to the Jews. As it is, my kingdom does not belong here”. 

Joh 18:37 Pilate said, “So, then you are a king?”. Jesus answered, “It is you who say that I am a king. I was born 
for this, I came into the world for this, to bear witness to the truth; and all who are on the side of truth listen to my 
voice”. 

Joh 18:38 “Truth?”. said Pilate. “What is that?”. And so saying he went out again to the Jews and said, “I find no 
case against him. 

Joh 18:39 But according to a custom of yours I should release one prisoner at the Passover; would you like me, 
then, to release for you the king of the Jews?”. 

Joh 18:40 At this they shouted, “Not this man”, they said, “but Barabbas”. Barabbas was a bandit. 

Joh 19:1 Pilate then had Jesus taken away and scourged; 

Joh 19:2 and after this, the soldiers twisted some thorns into a crown and put it on his head and dressed him in 
a purple robe. 

Joh 19:3 They kept coming up to him and saying, “Hail, king of the Jews!' and slapping him in the face. 

Joh 19:4 Pilate came outside again and said to them, “Look, I am going to bring him out to you to let you see 
that I find no case against him”. 

Joh 19:5 Jesus then came outwearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said, “Here is the man”. 
Joh 19:6 When they saw him, the chief priests and the guards shouted, “Crucify him! Crucify him!' Pilate said, 
'Take him yourselves and crucify him: I find no case against him”. 

Joh 1 9:7 The Jews replied, “We have a Law, and according to that Law he ought to be put to death, because he 
has claimed to be Son of God”. 

Joh 19:8 When Pilate heard them say this his fears increased. 

Joh 19:9 Re-entering the Praetorium, he said to Jesus, “Where do you come from?”. But Jesus made no answer. 
Joh 19:10 Pilate then said to him, “Are you refusing to speak to me? Surely you know I have power to release 
you and I have power to crucify you?”. 

Joh 19:1 1 Jesus replied, “You would have no power over me at all if it had not been given you from above; that 
is why the man who handed me over to you has the greater guilt”. 

Joh 19:12 From that moment Pilate was anxious to set him free, but the Jews shouted, “If you set him free you 
are no friend of Caesar’s; anyone who makes himself king is defying Caesar”. 

Joh 19:13 Hearing these words, Pilate had Jesus brought out, and seated him on the chair of judgement at a 
place called the Pavement, in Hebrew Gabbatha. 

Joh 19:14 It was the Day of Preparation, about the sixth hour. “Here is your king”, said Pilate to the Jews. 



Joh 19:15 But they shouted, “Away with him, away with him, crucify him”. Pilate said, “Shall I crucify your king?”. 
The chief priests answered, “We have no king except Caesar”. 

Joh 19:16 So at that Pilate handed him over to them to be crucified. They then took charge of Jesus, 

Joh 19:17 and carrying his own cross he went out to the Place of the Skull or, as it is called in Hebrew, 

Golgotha, 

Joh 19:18 where they crucified him with two others, one on either side, Jesus being in the middle. 

Joh 19:19 Pilate wrote out a notice and had it fixed to the cross; it ran: “Jesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews'. 
Joh 19:20 This notice was read by many of the Jews, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near 
the city, and the writing was in Hebrew, Latin and Greek. 

Joh 1 9:21 So the Jewish chief priests said to Pilate, “You should not write "King of the Jews", but that the man 
said, “I am King of the Jews". “ 

Joh 19:22 Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written”. 

Joh 19:23 When the soldiers had finished crucifying Jesus they took his clothing and divided it into four shares, 
one for each soldier. His undergarment was seamless, woven in one piece from neck to hem; 

Joh 19:24 so they said to one another, “Instead of tearing it, let’s throw dice to decide who is to have it”. In this 
way the words of scripture were fulfilled: They divide my garments among them and cast lots for my clothes. 

That is what the soldiers did. 

Joh 19:25 Near the cross of Jesus stood his mother and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary 
of Magdala. 

Joh 19:26 Seeing his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing near her, Jesus said to his mother, 
'Woman, this is your son”. 

Joh 19:27 Then to the disciple he said, “This is your mother”. And from that hour the disciple took her into his 
home. 

Joh 19:28 After this, Jesus knew that everything had now been completed and, so that the scripture should be 
completely fulfilled, he said: I am thirsty. 

Joh 1 9:29 A jar full of sour wine stood there; so, putting a sponge soaked in the wine on a hyssop stick, they 
held it up to his mouth. 

Joh 19:30 After Jesus had taken the wine he said, “It is fulfilled'; and bowing his head he gave up his spirit. 

Joh 19:31 It was the Day of Preparation, and to avoid the bodies' remaining on the cross during the Sabbath -- 
since that Sabbath was a day of special solemnity -- the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the 
bodies taken away. 

Joh 19:32 Consequently the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with him 
and then of the other. 

Joh 19:33 When they came to Jesus, they saw he was already dead, and so instead of breaking his legs 
Joh 19:34 one of the soldiers pierced his side with a lance; and immediately there came out blood and water. 
Joh 1 9:35 This is the evidence of one who saw it -- true evidence, and he knows that what he says is true — and 
he gives it so that you may believe as well. 

Joh 1 9:36 Because all this happened to fulfil the words of scripture: Not one bone of his will be broken; 

Joh 19:37 and again, in another place scripture says: They will look to the one whom they have pierced. 

Joh 1 9:38 After this, Joseph of Arimathaea, who was a disciple of Jesus -- though a secret one because he was 
afraid of the Jews — asked Pilate to let him remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave permission, so they came and 
took it away. 

Joh 19:39 Nicodemus came as well -- the same one who had first come to Jesus at night-time -- and he brought 
a mixture of myrrh and aloes, weighing about a hundred pounds. 

Joh 1 9:40 They took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, following the Jewish burial 
custom. 

Joh 19:41 At the place where he had been crucified there was a garden, and in this garden a new tomb in which 
no one had yet been buried. 

Joh 19:42 Since it was the Jewish Day of Preparation and the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there. 

Joh 20:1 It was very early on the first day of the week and still dark, when Mary of Magdala came to the tomb. 
She saw that the stone had been moved away from the tomb 

Joh 20:2 and came running to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved. “They have taken 
the Lord out of the tomb”, she said, “and we don’t know where they have put him”. 

Joh 20:3 So Peter set out with the other disciple to go to the tomb. 

Joh 20:4 They ran together, but the other disciple, running faster than Peter, reached the tomb first; 

Joh 20:5 he bent down and saw the linen cloths lying on the ground, but did not go in. 

Joh 20:6 Simon Peter, following him, also came up, went into the tomb, saw the linen cloths lying on the ground 
Joh 20:7 and also the cloth that had been over his head; this was not with the linen cloths but rolled up in a 
place by itself. 



Joh 20:8 Then the other disciple who had reached the tomb first also went in; he saw and he believed. 

Joh 20:9 Till this moment they had still not understood the scripture, that he must rise from the dead. 

Joh 20:10 The disciples then went back home. 

Joh 20:1 1 But Mary was standing outside near the tomb, weeping. Then, as she wept, she stooped to look 
inside, 

Joh 20:12 and saw two angels in white sitting where the body of Jesus had been, one at the head, the other at 
the feet. 

Joh 20:13 They said, “Woman, why are you weeping?”. “They have taken my Lord away”, she replied, “and I don’t 
know where they have put him”. 

Joh 20:14 As she said this she turned round and saw Jesus standing there, though she did not realise that it 
was Jesus. 

Joh 20:15 Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?”. Supposing him to be the 
gardener, she said, “Sir, if you have taken him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will go and remove 
him”. 

Joh 20:16 Jesus said, “Mary!' She turned round then and said to him in Hebrew, “Rabbuni!' -- which means 
Master. 

Joh 20:17 Jesus said to her, “Do not cling to me, because I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to the 
brothers, and tell them: I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God”. 

Joh 20:18 So Mary of Magdala told the disciples, “I have seen the Lord”, and that he had said these things to 
her. 

Joh 20:19 In the evening of that same day, the first day of the week, the doors were closed in the room where 
the disciples were, for fear of the Jews. Jesus came and stood among them. He said to them, “Peace be with 
you”, 

Joh 20:20 and, after saying this, he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples were filled with joy at 
seeing the Lord, 

Joh 20:21 and he said to them again, “Peace be with you. “As the Father sent me, so am I sending you”. 

Joh 20:22 After saying this he breathed on them and said: Receive the Holy Spirit. 

Joh 20:23 If you forgive anyone’s sins, they are forgiven; if you retain anyone’s sins, they are retained. 

Joh 20:24 Thomas, called the Twin, who was one of the Twelve, was not with them when Jesus came. 

Joh 20:25 So the other disciples said to him, “We have seen the Lord”, but he answered, “Unless I can see the 
holes that the nails made in his hands and can put my finger into the holes they made, and unless I can put my 
hand into his side, I refuse to believe”. 

Joh 20:26 Eight days later the disciples were in the house again and Thomas was with them. The doors were 
closed, but Jesus came in and stood among them. “Peace be with you”, he said. 

Joh 20:27 Then he spoke to Thomas, “Put your finger here; look, here are my hands. Give me your hand; put it 
into my side. Do not be unbelieving any more but believe”. 

Joh 20:28 Thomas replied, “My Lord and my God!' 

Joh 20:29 Jesus said to him: You believe because you can see me. Blessed are those who have not seen and 
yet believe. 

Joh 20:30 There were many other signs that Jesus worked in the sight of the disciples, but they are not 
recorded in this book. 

Joh 20:31 These are recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that 
believing this you may have life through his name. 

Joh 21:1 Later on, Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples. It was by the Sea of Tiberias, and it happened 
like this: 

Joh 21:2 Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee and two 
more of his disciples were together. 

Joh 21 :3 Simon Peter said, “I'm going fishing”. They replied, “We'll come with you”. They went out and got into 
the boat but caught nothing that night. 

Joh 21 :4 When it was already light, there stood Jesus on the shore, though the disciples did not realise that it 
was Jesus. 

Joh 21 :5 Jesus called out, “Haven’t you caught anything, friends?”. And when they answered, “No”, 

Joh 21 :6 he said, “Throw the net out to starboard and you'll find something”. So they threw the net out and could 
not haul it in because of the quantity offish. 

Joh 21 :7 The disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord”. At these words, “It is the Lord”, Simon 
Peter tied his outer garment round him (for he had nothing on) and jumped into the water. 

Joh 21 :8 The other disciples came on in the boat, towing the net with the fish; they were only about a hundred 
yards from land. 

Joh 21 :9 As soon as they came ashore they saw that there was some bread there and a charcoal fire with fish 



cooking on it. 

Joh 21:10 Jesus said, “Bring some of the fish you have just caught”. 

Joh 21:11 Simon Peter went aboard and dragged the net ashore, full of big fish, one hundred and fifty-three of 
them; and in spite of there being so many the net was not broken. 

Joh 21:12 Jesus said to them, “Come and have breakfast”. None of the disciples was bold enough to ask, “Who 
are you?'. They knew quite well it was the Lord. 

Joh 21:13 Jesus then stepped forward, took the bread and gave it to them, and the same with the fish. 

Joh 21:14 This was the third time that Jesus revealed himself to the disciples after rising from the dead. 

Joh 21:15 When they had eaten, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon son of John, do you love me more than 
these others do?”. He answered, “Yes, Lord, you know I love you”. Jesus said to him, “Feed my lambs”. 

Joh 21:16 A second time he said to him, “Simon son of John, do you love me?”. He replied, “Yes, Lord, you know 
I love you”. Jesus said to him, “Look after my sheep”. 

Joh 21:17 Then he said to him a third time, “Simon son of John, do you love me?”. Peter was hurt that he asked 
him a third time, “Do you love me?”. and said, “Lord, you know everything; you know I love you”. Jesus said to him, 
'Feed my sheep. 

Joh 21:18 In all truth I tell you, when you were young you put on your own belt and walked where you liked; but 
when you grow old you will stretch out your hands, and somebody else will put a belt round you and take you 
where you would rather not go”. 

Joh 21:19 In these words he indicated the kind of death by which Peter would give glory to God. After this he 
said, “Follow me”. 

Joh 21 :20 Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them -- the one who had leant back 
close to his chest at the supper and had said to him, “Lord, who is it that will betray you?”. 

Joh 21 :21 Seeing him, Peter said to Jesus, “What about him, Lord?”. 

Joh 21 :22 Jesus answered, “If I want him to stay behind till I come, what does it matter to you? You are to follow 
me”. 

Joh 21 :23 The rumour then went out among the brothers that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus had not said 
to Peter, “He will not die”, but, “If I want him to stay behind till I come”. 

Joh 21 :24 This disciple is the one who vouches for these things and has written them down, and we know that 
his testimony is true. 

Joh 21 :25 There was much else that Jesus did; if it were written down in detail, I do not suppose the world itself 
would hold all the books that would be written.
