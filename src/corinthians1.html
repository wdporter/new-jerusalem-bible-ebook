<h1>The First Letter of Paul to the Church at Corinth</h1>

<h2 id="intro">Introduction (1:1–9)</h2>

<h4>Address and greetings. Thanksgiving (1:1–9)</h4>

<p>Paul, called by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and Sosthenes, our brother, to the church of God in Corinth, to those who have been consecrated in Christ Jesus and called to be God’s holy people, with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord as well as ours. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. </p>

<p>I am continually thanking God about you, for the grace of God which you have been given in Christ Jesus; in him you have been richly endowed in every kind of utterance and knowledge; so firmly has witness to Christ taken root in you. And so you are not lacking in any gift as you wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed; he will continue to give you strength until the very end, so that you will be irreproachable on the Day of our Lord Jesus Christ. You can rely on God, who has called you to be partners with his Son Jesus Christ our Lord. </p>

<h2 id="i">I: Divisions and Scandals (1:10–6:20)</h2>

<h3 id="ia">A: Factions in the Corinthian Church (1:10–4:21)</h3>

<h4>Dissensions among the faithful (1:10–16)</h4>

<p>Brothers, I urge you, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, not to have factions among yourselves but all to be in agreement in what you profess; so that you are perfectly united in your beliefs and judgements. From what Chloe’s people have been telling me about you, brothers, it is clear that there are serious differences among you. What I mean is this: every one of you is declaring, “I belong to Paul”, or “I belong to Apollos”, or “I belong to Cephas”, or “I belong to Christ”. Has Christ been split up? Was it Paul that was crucified for you, or was it in Paul’s name that you were baptised? I am thankful I did not baptise any of you, except Crispus and Gaius, so that no one can say that you were baptised in my name. Yes, I did baptise the family of Stephanas, too; but besides these I do not think I baptised anyone. </p>

<h4>The true wisdom and the false (1:17–2:16)</h4>

<p>After all, Christ sent me not to baptise, but to preach the gospel; and not by means of wisdom of language, wise words which would make the cross of Christ pointless. The message of the cross is folly for those who are on the way to ruin, but for those of us who are on the road to salvation it is the power of God. As scripture says: I am going to destroy the wisdom of the wise and bring to nothing the understanding of any who understand. Where are the philosophers? Where are the experts? And where are the debaters of this age? Do you not see how God has shown up human wisdom as folly? Since in the wisdom of God the world was unable to recognise God through wisdom, it was God’s own pleasure to save believers through the folly of the gospel. While the Jews demand miracles and the Greeks look for wisdom, we are preaching a crucified Christ: to the Jews an obstacle they cannot get over, to the gentiles foolishness, but to those who have been called, whether they are Jews or Greeks, a Christ who is both the power of God and the wisdom of God. God’s folly is wiser than human wisdom, and God’s weakness is stronger than human strength. Consider, brothers, how you were called; not many of you are wise by human standards, not many influential, not many from noble families. No, God chose those who by human standards are fools to shame the wise; he chose those who by human standards are weak to shame the strong, those who by human standards are common and contemptible — indeed those who count for nothing — to reduce to nothing all those that do count for something, so that no human being might feel boastful before God. It is by him that you exist in Christ Jesus, who for us was made wisdom from God, and saving justice and holiness and redemption. As scripture says: If anyone wants to boast, let him boast of the Lord. </p>

<p>Now when I came to you, brothers, I did not come with any brilliance of oratory or wise argument to announce to you the mystery of God. I was resolved that the only knowledge I would have while I was with you was knowledge of Jesus, and of him as the crucified Christ. I came among you in weakness, in fear and great trembling and what I spoke and proclaimed was not meant to convince by philosophical argument, but to demonstrate the convincing power of the Spirit, so that your faith should depend not on human wisdom but on the power of God. </p>

<p>But still, to those who have reached maturity, we do talk of a wisdom, not, it is true, a philosophy of this age or of the rulers of this age, who will not last long now. It is of the mysterious wisdom of God that we talk, the wisdom that was hidden, which God predestined to be for our glory before the ages began. None of the rulers of the age recognised it; for if they had recognised it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory; but it is as scripture says: What no eye has seen and no ear has heard, what the mind of man cannot visualise; all that God has prepared for those who love him, to us, though, God has given revelation through the Spirit, for the Spirit explores the depths of everything, even the depths of God. After all, is there anyone who knows the qualities of anyone except his own spirit, within him; and in the same way, nobody knows the qualities of God except the Spirit of God. Now, the Spirit we have received is not the spirit of the world but God’s own Spirit, so that we may understand the lavish gifts God has given us. And these are what we speak of, not in the terms learnt from human philosophy, but in terms learnt from the Spirit, fitting spiritual language to spiritual things. The natural person has no room for the gifts of God’s Spirit; to him they are folly; he cannot recognise them, because their value can be assessed only in the Spirit. The spiritual person, on the other hand, can assess the value of everything, and that person’s value cannot be assessed by anybody else. For: who has ever known the mind of the Lord? Who has ever been his adviser? But we are those who have the mind of Christ. </p>

<p>And so, brothers, I was not able to talk to you as spiritual people; I had to talk to you as people still living by your natural inclinations, still infants in Christ; I fed you with milk and not solid food, for you were not yet able to take it — and even now, you are still not able to, for you are still living by your natural inclinations. As long as there are jealousy and rivalry among you, that surely means that you are still living by your natural inclinations and by merely human principles. While there is one that says, “I belong to Paul” and another that says, “I belong to Apollos”, are you not 
being only too human? </p>

<h4>The place of the Christian preacher (3:5–17)</h4>

<p>For what is Apollos and what is Paul? The servants through whom you came to believe, and each has only what the Lord has given him. I did the planting, Apollos did the watering, but God gave growth. In this, neither the planter nor the waterer counts for anything; only God, who gives growth. It is all one who does the planting and who does the watering, and each will have the proper pay for the work that he has done. After all, we do share in God’s work; you are God’s farm, God’s building. </p>

<p>By the grace of God which was given to me, I laid the foundations like a trained master-builder, and someöne else is building on them. Now each one must be careful how he does the building. For nobody can lay down any other foundation than the one which is there already, namely Jesus Christ. On this foundation, different people may build in gold, silver, jewels, wood, hay or straw but each person’s handiwork will be shown for what it is. The Day which dawns in fire will make it clear and the fire itself will test the quality of each person’s work. The one whose work stands up to it will be given his wages; the one whose work is burnt down will suffer the loss of it, though he himself will be saved; he will be saved as someöne might expect to be saved from a fire. </p>

<p>Do you not realise that you are a temple of God with the Spirit of God living in you? If anybody should destroy the temple of God, God will destroy that person, because God’s temple is holy; and you are that temple. </p>

<h4>Conclusions (3:18–4:13)</h4>

<p>There is no room for self-delusion. Any one of you who thinks he is wise by worldly standards must learn to be a fool in order to be really wise. For the wisdom of the world is folly to God. As scripture says: He traps the crafty in the snare of their own cunning,  and again: The Lord knows the plans of the wise and how insipid they are. So there is to be no boasting about human beings: everything belongs to you, whether it is Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, the world, life or death, the present or the future — all belong to you; but you belong to Christ and Christ belongs to God. </p>

<p>People should think of us as Christ’s servants, stewards entrusted with the mysteries of God. In such a matter, what is expected of stewards is that each one should be found trustworthy. It is of no importance to me how you or any other human court may judge me: I will not even be the judge of my own self. It is true that my conscience does not reproach me, but that is not enough to justify me: it is the Lord who is my judge. For that reason, do not judge anything before the due time, until the Lord comes; he will bring to light everything that is hidden in darkness and reveal the designs of all hearts. Then everyone will receive from God the appropriate commendation. </p>

<p>I have applied all this to myself and Apollos for your sakes, so that you can learn how the saying, “Nothing beyond what is written” is true of us: no individual among you must become filled with his own importance and make comparisons, to another’s detriment. Who made you so important? What have you got that was not given to you? And if it was given to you, why are you boasting as though it were your own? You already have everything — you are rich already — you have come into your kingdom, without any help from us! Well, I wish you were kings and we could be kings with you! For it seems to me that God has put us apostles on show right at the end, like men condemned to death: we have been exhibited as a spectacle to the whole universe, both angelic and human. Here we are, fools for Christ’s sake, while you are the clever ones in Christ; we are weak, while you are strong; you are honoured, while we are disgraced. To this day, we go short of food and drink and clothes, we are beaten up and we have no homes; we earn our living by labouring with our own hands; when we are cursed, we answer with a blessing; when we are hounded, we endure it passively; when we are insulted, we give a courteous answer. We are treated even now as the dregs of the world, the very lowest scum. </p>

<h4>An appeal (4:14–21)</h4>

<p>I am writing all this not to make you ashamed but simply to remind you, as my dear children; for even though you might have ten thousand slaves to look after you in Christ, you still have no more than one father, and it was I who fathered you in Christ Jesus, by the gospel. That is why I urge you to take me as your pattern and why I have sent you Timothy, a dear and faithful son to me in the Lord, who will remind you of my principles of conduct in Christ, as I teach them everywhere in every church. </p>

<p>On the assumption that I was not coming to you, some of you have become filled with your own self-importance; but I shall be coming to you soon, the Lord willing, and then I shall find out not what these self-important people say, but what power they have. For the kingdom of God consists not in spoken words but in power. What do you want then? Am I to come to you with a stick in my hand or in love, and with a spirit of gentleness? </p>

<hr />
ICo 5:1 It is widely reported that there is sexual immorality among you, immorality of a kind that is not found 
even among gentiles: that one of you is living with his stepmother. 

ICo 5:2 And you so filled with your own self-importance! It would have been better if you had been grieving 
bitterly, so that the man who has done this thing were turned out of the community. 

ICo 5:3 For my part, however distant I am physically, I am present in spirit and have already condemned the 
man who behaved in this way, just as though I were present in person. 

1 Co 5:4 When you have gathered together in the name of our Lord Jesus, with the presence of my spirit, and in 
the power of our Lord Jesus, 

ICo 5:5 hand such a man over to Satan, to be destroyed as far as natural life is concerned, so that on the Day 
of the Lord his spirit may be saved. 

ICo 5:6 Your self-satisfaction is ill founded. Do you not realise that only a little yeast leavens the whole batch of 
dough? 

1 Co 5:7 Throw out the old yeast so that you can be the fresh dough, unleavened as you are. For our Passover 
has been sacrificed, that is, Christ; 

ICo 5:8 let us keep the feast, then, with none of the old yeast and no leavening of evil and wickedness, but only 
the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. 

ICo 5:9 In my letter, I wrote to you that you should have nothing to do with people living immoral lives. 

ICo 5:10 I was not including everybody in this present world who is sexually immoral, or everybody who is 
greedy, or dishonest or worships false gods — that would mean you would have to cut yourselves off completely 
from the world. 

ICo 5:1 1 In fact what I meant was that you were not to have anything to do with anyone going by the name of 
brother who is sexually immoral, or is greedy, or worships false gods, or is a slanderer or a drunkard or 
dishonest; never even have a meal with anybody of that kind. 

1 Co 5: 1 2 It is no concern of mine to judge outsiders. It is for you to judge those who are inside, is it not? 

ICo 5:13 But outsiders are for God to judge. You must banish this evil-doer from among you. 

1 Co 6: 1 Is one of you with a complaint against another so brazen as to seek judgement from sinners and not 
from God’s holy people? 

1 Co 6:2 Do you not realise that the holy people of God are to be the judges of the world? And if the world is to 
be judged by you, are you not competent for petty cases? 

1 Co 6:3 Do you not realise that we shall be the judges of angels? - then quite certainly over matters of this life. 
ICo 6:4 But when you have matters of this life to be judged, you bring them before those who are of no account 
in the Church! 

ICo 6:5 I say this to make you ashamed of yourselves. Can it really be that it is impossible to find in the 
community one sensible person capable of deciding questions between brothers, 

ICo 6:6 and that this is why brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers? 

ICo 6:7 No; it is a fault in you, by itself, that one of you should go to law against another at all: why do you not 
prefer to suffer injustice, why not prefer to be defrauded? 

ICo 6:8 And here you are, doing the injustice and the defrauding, and to your own brothers. 

1 Co 6:9 Do you not realise that people who do evil will never inherit the kingdom of God? Make no mistake — 
the sexually immoral, idolaters, adulterers, the self-indulgent, sodomites, 

ICo 6:10 thieves, misers, drunkards, slanderers and swindlers, none of these will inherit the kingdom of God. 
ICo 6:1 1 Some of you used to be of that kind: but you have been washed clean, you have been sanctified, and 
you have been justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and through the Spirit of our God. 

ICo 6:12 “For me everything is permissible”; maybe, but not everything does good. True, for me everything is 
permissible, but I am determined not to be dominated by anything. 

ICo 6:13 Foods are for the stomach, and the stomach is for foods; and God will destroy them both. But the 
body is not for sexual immorality; 

ICo 6:14 it is for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body. God raised up the Lord and he will raise us up too by his 
power. 

1 Co 6: 1 5 Do you not realise that your bodies are members of Christ’s body; do you think one can take parts of 
Christ’s body and join them to the body of a prostitute? Out of the question! 

ICo 6:16 Or do you not realise that anyone who attaches himself to a prostitute is one body with her, since the 
two, as it is said, become one flesh. 

ICo 6:17 But anyone who attaches himself to the Lord is one spirit with him. 

ICo 6:18 Keep away from sexual immorality. All other sins that people may commit are done outside the body; 
but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body. 



1 Co 6: 1 9 Do you not realise that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you and whom you 
received from God? 

1 Co 6:20 You are not your own property, then; you have been bought at a price. So use your body for the glory 
of God. 

ICo 7:1 Now for the questions about which you wrote. Yes, it is a good thing for a man not to touch a woman; 
ICo 7:2 yet to avoid immorality every man should have his own wife and every woman her own husband. 

ICo 7:3 The husband must give to his wife what she has a right to expect, and so too the wife to her husband. 
ICo 7:4 The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does; and in the same way, the 
husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. 

ICo 7:5 You must not deprive each other, except by mutual consent for a limited time, to leave yourselves free 
for prayer, and to come together again afterwards; otherwise Satan may take advantage of any lack of self- 
control to put you to the test. 

ICo 7:6 I am telling you this as a concession, not an order. 

ICo 7:7 I should still like everyone to be as I am myself; but everyone has his own gift from God, one this kind 
and the next something different. 

ICo 7:8 To the unmarried and to widows I say: it is good for them to stay as they are, like me. 

ICo 7:9 But if they cannot exercise self-control, let them marry, since it is better to be married than to be burnt 

up. 

ICo 7:10 To the married I give this ruling, and this is not mine but the Lord's: a wife must not be separated from 
her husband- 

ICo 7:1 1 or if she has already left him, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband — and 
a husband must not divorce his wife. 

ICo 7:12 For other cases these instructions are my own, not the Lord’s. If one of the brothers has a wife who is 
not a believer, and she is willing to stay with him, he should not divorce her; 

ICo 7:13 and if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to stay with her, she should not 
divorce her husband. 

ICo 7:14 You see, the unbelieving husband is sanctified through his wife and the unbelieving wife is sanctified 
through the brother. If this were not so, your children would be unclean, whereäs in fact they are holy. 

ICo 7:15 But if the unbeliever chooses to leave, then let the separation take place: in these circumstances, the 
brother or sister is no longer tied. But God has called you to live in peace: 

ICo 7:16 as a wife, how can you tell whether you are to be the salvation of your husband; as a husband, how 
can you tell whether you are to be the salvation of your wife? 

ICo 7:17 Anyway let everyone continue in the part which the Lord has allotted to him, as he was when God 
called him. This is the rule that I give to all the churches. 

ICo 7:18 If a man who is called has already been circumcised, then he must stay circumcised; when an 
uncircumcised man is called, he may not be circumcised. 

ICo 7:19 To be circumcised is of no importance, and to be uncircumcised is of no importance; what is important 
is the keeping of God’s commandments. 

ICo 7:20 Everyone should stay in whatever state he was in when he was called. 

ICo 7:21 So, if when you were called, you were a slave, do not think it matters — even if you have a chance of 
freedom, you should prefer to make full use of your condition as a slave. 

ICo 7:22 You see, anyone who was called in the Lord while a slave, is a freeman of the Lord; and in the same 
way, anyone who was free when called, is a slave of Christ. 

ICo 7:23 You have been bought at a price; do not be slaves now to any human being. 

ICo 7:24 Each one of you, brothers, is to stay before God in the state in which you were called. 

ICo 7:25 About people remaining virgin, I have no directions from the Lord, but I give my own opinion as a 
person who has been granted the Lord’s mercy to be faithful. 

ICo 7:26 Well then, because of the stress which is weighing upon us, the right thing seems to be this: it is good 
for people to stay as they are. 

ICo 7:27 If you are joined to a wife, do not seek to be released; if you are freed of a wife, do not look for a wife. 
ICo 7:28 However, if you do get married, that is not a sin, and it is not sinful for a virgin to enter upon marriage. 
But such people will have the hardships consequent on human nature, and I would like you to be without that. 
ICo 7:29 What I mean, brothers, is that the time has become limited, and from now on, those who have 
spouses should live as though they had none; 

ICo 7:30 and those who mourn as though they were not mourning; those who enjoy life as though they did not 
enjoy it; those who have been buying property as though they had no possessions; 

ICo 7:31 and those who are involved with the world as though they were people not engrossed in it. Because 
this world as we know it is passing away. 

ICo 7:32 I should like you to have your minds free from all worry. The unmarried man gives his mind to the 



Lord’s affairs and to how he can please the Lord; 

ICo 7:33 but the man who is married gives his mind to the affairs of this world and to how he can please his 
wife, and he is divided in mind. 

ICo 7:34 So, too, the unmarried woman, and the virgin, gives her mind to the Lord’s affairs and to being holy in 
body and spirit; but the married woman gives her mind to the affairs of this world and to how she can please her 
husband. 

ICo 7:35 I am saying this only to help you, not to put a bridle on you, but so that everything is as it should be, 
and you are able to give your undivided attention to the Lord. 

ICo 7:36 If someöne with strong passions thinks that he is behaving badly towards his fiance'e and that things 
should take their due course, he should follow his desires. There is no sin in it; they should marry. 

ICo 7:37 But if he stands firm in his resolution, without any compulsion but with full control of his own will, and 
decides to let her remain as his fiance'e, then he is acting well. 

ICo 7:38 In other words, he who marries his fiance'e is doing well, and he who does not, better still. 

ICo 7:39 A wife is tied as long as her husband is alive. But if the husband dies, she is free to marry anybody 
she likes, only it must be in the Lord. 

ICo 7:40 She would be happier if she stayed as she is, to my way of thinking — and I believe that I too have the 
Spirit of God. 

ICo 8:1 Now about food which has been dedicated to false gods. We are well aware that all of us have 
knowledge; but while knowledge puffs up, love is what builds up. 

1 Co 8:2 Someöne may think that he has full knowledge of something and yet not know it as well as he should; 
ICo 8:3 but someöne who loves God is known by God. 

1 Co 8:4 On the subject of eating foods dedicated to false gods, we are well aware that none of the false gods 
exists in reality and that there is no God other than the One. 

1 Co 8:5 Though there are so-called gods, in the heavens or on earth — and there are plenty of gods and plenty 
of lords- 

1 Co 8:6 yet for us there is only one God, the Father from whom all things come and for whom we exist, and one 
Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things come and through whom we exist. 

ICo 8:7 However, not everybody has this knowledge. There are some in whose consciences false gods still 
play such a part that they take the food as though it had been dedicated to a god; then their conscience, being 
vulnerable, is defiled, 

ICo 8:8 But of course food cannot make us acceptable to God; we lose nothing by not eating it, we gain nothing 
by eating it. 

ICo 8:9 Only be careful that this freedom of yours does not in any way turn into an obstacle to trip those who 
are vulnerable. 

ICo 8:10 Suppose someöne sees you, who have the knowledge, sitting eating in the temple of some false god, 
do you not think that his conscience, vulnerable as it is, may be encouraged to eat foods dedicated to false 
gods? 

ICo 8:1 1 And then it would be through your knowledge that this brother for whom Christ died, vulnerable as he 
is, has been lost. 

1 Co 8: 1 2 So, sinning against your brothers and wounding their vulnerable consciences, you would be sinning 
against Christ. 

ICo 8:13 That is why, if food can be the cause of a brother’s downfall, I will never eat meat any more, rather 
than cause my brother’s downfall. 

ICo 9:1 Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord? 
1 Co 9:2 Even if to others I am not an apostle, to you at any rate I am, for you are the seal of my apostolate in 
the Lord. 

ICo 9:3 To those who want to interrogate me, this is my answer. 

ICo 9:4 Have we not every right to eat and drink? 

ICo 9:5 And every right to be accompanied by a Christian wife, like the other apostles, like the brothers of the 
Lord, and like Cephas? 

1 Co 9:6 Are Barnabas and I the only ones who have no right to stop working? 

1 Co 9:7 What soldier would ever serve in the army at his own expense? And who is there who would plant a 
vineyard and never eat the fruit from it; or would keep a flock and not feed on the milk from his flock? 

1 Co 9:8 Do not think that this is merely worldly wisdom. Does not the Law say exactly the same? It is written in 
the Law of Moses: 

ICo 9:9 You must not muzzle an ox when it is treading out the corn. Is it about oxen that God is concerned 
here, 

1 Co 9: 1 0 or is it not said entirely for our sake? Clearly it was written for our sake, because it is right that 
whoëver ploughs should plough with the expectation of having his share, and whoëver threshes should thresh 



with the expectation of having his share. 

1 Co 9:1 1 If we have sown the seed of spiritual things in you, is it too much to ask that we should receive from 
you a crop of material things? 

1 Co 9:12 Others have been given such rights over you and do we not deserve more? In fact, we have never 
exercised this right; on the contrary, we have put up with anything rather than obstruct the gospel of Christ in any 
way. 

ICo 9:13 Do you not realise that the ministers in the Temple get their food from the Temple, and those who 
serve at the altar can claim their share from the altar? 

ICo 9:14 In the same way, the Lord gave the instruction that those who preach the gospel should get their living 
from the gospel. 

ICo 9:15 However, I have never availed myself of any rights of this kind; and I have not written this to secure 
such treatment for myself; I would rather die than that ... No one shall take from me this ground of boasting. 

ICo 9:16 In fact, preaching the gospel gives me nothing to boast of, for I am under compulsion and I should be 
in trouble if I failed to do it. 

ICo 9:17 If I did it on my own initiative I would deserve a reward; but if I do it under compulsion I am simply 
accepting a task entrusted to me. 

ICo 9:18 What reward do I have, then? That in my preaching I offer the gospel free of charge to avoid using the 
rights which the gospel allows me. 

ICo 9:19 So though I was not a slave to any human being, I put myself in slavery to all people, to win as many 
as I could. 

ICo 9:20 To the Jews I made myself as a Jew, to win the Jews; to those under the Law as one under the Law 
(though I am not), in order to win those under the Law; 

ICo 9:21 to those outside the Law as one outside the Law, though I am not outside the Law but under Christ’s 
law, to win those outside the Law. 

ICo 9:22 To the weak, I made myself weak, to win the weak. I accommodated myself to people in all kinds of 
different situations, so that by all possible means I might bring some to salvation. 

ICo 9:23 All this I do for the sake of the gospel, that I may share its benefits with others. 

ICo 9:24 Do you not realise that, though all the runners in the stadium take part in the race, only one of them 
gets the prize? Run like that — to win. 

ICo 9:25 Every athlete concentrates completely on training, and this is to win a wreath that will wither, whereäs 
ours will never wither. 

1 Co 9:26 So that is how I run, not without a clear goal; and how I box, not wasting blows on air. 

ICo 9:27 I punish my body and bring it under control, to avoid any risk that, having acted as herald for others, I 
myself may be disqualified. 

ICo 10:1 I want you to be quite certain, brothers, that our ancestors all had the cloud over them and all passed 
through the sea. 

ICo 10:2 In the cloud and in the sea they were all baptised into Moses; 

ICo 10:3 all ate the same spiritual food 

ICo 10:4 and all drank the same spiritual drink, since they drank from the spiritual rock which followed them, 
and that rock was Christ. 

1 Co 1 0:5 In spite of this, God was not pleased with most of them, and their corpses were scattered over the 
desert. 

1 Co 1 0:6 Now these happenings were examples, for our benefit, so that we should never set our hearts, as they 
did, on evil things; 

1 Co 1 0:7 nor are you to worship false gods, as some of them did, as it says in scripture: The people sat down to 
eat and drink, and afterwards got up to amuse themselves. 

ICo 10:8 Nor, again, are we to fall into sexual immorality; some of them did this, and twenty-three thousand met 
their downfall in one day. 

ICo 10:9 And we are not to put the Lord to the test; some of them put him to the test, and they were killed by 
snakes. 

ICo 10:10 Never complain; some of them complained, and they were killed by the Destroyer. 

ICo 10:1 1 Now all these things happened to them by way of example, and they were described in writing to be 
a lesson for us, to whom it has fallen to live in the last days of the ages. 

ICo 10:12 Everyone, no matter how firmly he thinks he is standing, must be careful he does not fall. 

ICo 10:13 None of the trials which have come upon you is more than a human being can stand. You can trust 
that God will not let you be put to the test beyond your strength, but with any trial will also provide a way out by 
enabling you to put up with it. 

ICo 10:14 For that reason, my dear friends, have nothing to do with the worship of false gods. 

ICo 10:15 I am talking to you as sensible people; weigh up for yourselves what I have to say. 



ICo 10:16 The blessing-cup, which we bless, is it not a sharing in the blood of Christ; and the loaf of bread 
which we break, is it not a sharing in the body of Christ? 

ICo 10:17 And as there is one loaf, so we, although there are many of us, are one single body, for we all share 
in the one loaf. 

ICo 10:18 Now compare the natural people of Israel: is it not true that those who eat the sacrifices share the 
altar? 

ICo 10:19 What does this mean? That the dedication of food to false gods amounts to anything? Or that false 
gods themselves amount to anything? 

ICo 10:20 No, it does not; simply that when pagans sacrifice, what is sacrificed by them is sacrificed to demons 
who are not God. I do not want you to share with demons. 

1 Co 1 0:21 You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons as well; you cannot have a share at the 
Lord’s table and the demons’ table as well. 

1 Co 1 0:22 Do we really want to arouse the Lord’s jealousy; are we stronger than he is? 

ICo 10:23 “Everything is permissible”; maybe so, but not everything does good. True, everything is permissible, 
but not everything builds people up. 

ICo 10:24 Nobody should be looking for selfish advantage, but everybody for someöne else’s. 

ICo 10:25 Eat anything that is sold in butchers’ shops; there is no need to ask questions for conscience’s sake, 
ICo 10:26 since To the Lord belong the earth and all it contains. 

ICo 10:27 If an unbeliever invites you to a meal, go if you want to, and eat whatever is put before you; you need 
not ask questions of conscience first. 

ICo 10:28 But if someöne says to you, “This food has been offered in sacrifice”, do not eat it, out of 
consideration for the person that told you, for conscience’s sake- 

ICo 10:29 not your own conscience, I mean, but the other person’s. Why should my freedom be governed by 
somebody else’s conscience? 

1 Co 1 0:30 Provided that I accept it with gratitude, why should I be blamed for eating food for which I give 
thanks? 

1 Co 1 0:31 Whatever you eat, then, or drink, and whatever else you do, do it all for the glory of God. 

1 Co 1 0:32 Never be a cause of offence, either to Jews or to Greeks or to the Church of God, 

1 Co 1 0:33 just as I try to accommodate everybody in everything, not looking for my own advantage, but for the 

advantage of everybody else, so that they may be saved. 

ICo 11:1 Take me as your pattern, just as I take Christ for mine. 

ICo 1 1 :2 I congratulate you for remembering me so consistently and for maintaining the traditions exactly as I 
passed them on to you. 

ICo 11:3 But I should like you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of woman is man, 
and the head of Christ is God. 

ICo 1 1 :4 For any man to pray or to prophesy with his head covered shows disrespect for his head. 

ICo 11:5 And for a woman to pray or prophesy with her head uncovered shows disrespect for her head; it is 
exactly the same as if she had her hair shaved off. 

ICo 1 1 :6 Indeed, if a woman does go without a veil, she should have her hair cut off too; but if it is a shameful 

thing for a woman to have her hair cut off or shaved off, then she should wear a veil. 

ICo 11:7 But for a man it is not right to have his head covered, since he is the image of God and reflects God’s 
glory; but woman is the reflection of man’s glory. 

ICo 11:8 For man did not come from woman; no, woman came from man; 

ICo 11:9 nor was man created for the sake of woman, but woman for the sake of man: 

ICo 11:10 and this is why it is right for a woman to wear on her head a sign of the authority over her, because 
of the angels. 

ICo 11:11 However, in the Lord, though woman is nothing without man, man is nothing without woman; 

ICo 11:12 and though woman came from man, so does every man come from a woman, and everything comes 
from God. 

ICo 11:13 Decide for yourselves: does it seem fitting that a woman should pray to God without a veil? 

ICo 1 1:14 Does not nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him, 

ICo 11:15 but when a woman has long hair, it is her glory? After all, her hair was given to her to be a covering. 
ICo 1 1 :1 6 If anyone wants to be contentious, I say that we have no such custom, nor do any of the churches of 
God. 

ICo 11:17 Now that I am on the subject of instructions, I cannot congratulate you on the meetings you hold; 
they do more harm than good. 

ICo 1 1 :1 8 In the first place, I hear that when you all come together in your assembly, there are separate 
factions among you, and to some extent I believe it. 

ICo 1 1 :1 9 It is no bad thing, either, that there should be differing groups among you so that those who are to be 



trusted among you can be clearly recognised. 

ICo 1 1 :20 So, when you meet together, it is not the Lord’s Supper that you eat; 

1 Co 1 1 :21 for when the eating begins, each one of you has his own supper first, and there is one going hungry 
while another is getting drunk. 

1 Co 1 1 :22 Surely you have homes for doing your eating and drinking in? Or have you such disregard for God’s 
assembly that you can put to shame those who have nothing? What am I to say to you? Congratulate you? On 
this I cannot congratulate you. 

ICo 1 1 :23 For the tradition I received from the Lord and also handed on to you is that on the night he was 
betrayed, the Lord Jesus took some bread, 

1 Co 1 1 :24 and after he had given thanks, he broke it, and he said, “This is my body, which is for you; do this in 
remembrance of me”. 

1 Co 1 1 :25 And in the same way, with the cup after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. 
Whenever you drink it, do this as a memorial of me”. 

1 Co 1 1 :26 Whenever you eat this bread, then, and drink this cup, you are proclaiming the Lord’s death until he 
comes. 

ICo 1 1 :27 Therefore anyone who eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord unworthily is answerable for the 
body and blood of the Lord. 

1 Co 1 1 :28 Everyone is to examine himself and only then eat of the bread or drink from the cup; 

1 Co 1 1 :29 because a person who eats and drinks without recognising the body is eating and drinking his own 
condemnation. 

1 Co 1 1 :30 That is why many of you are weak and ill and a good number have died. 

1 Co 1 1 :31 If we were critical of ourselves we would not be condemned, 

ICo 1 1 :32 but when we are judged by the Lord, we are corrected by the Lord to save us from being condemned 
along with the world. 

1 Co 1 1 :33 So then, my brothers, when you meet for the Meal, wait for each other; 

1 Co 1 1 :34 anyone who is hungry should eat at home. Then your meeting will not bring your condemnation. The 
other matters I shall arrange when I come. 

ICo 12:1 About the gifts of the Spirit, brothers, I want you to be quite certain. 

ICo 12:2 You remember that, when you were pagans, you were irresistibly drawn to inarticulate heathen gods. 
ICo 1 2:3 Because of that, I want to make it quite clear to you that no one who says “A curse on Jesus’ can be 
speaking in the Spirit of God, and nobody is able to say, “Jesus is Lord” except in the Holy Spirit. 

ICo 12:4 There are many different gifts, but it is always the same Spirit; 

ICo 1 2:5 there are many different ways of serving, but it is always the same Lord. 

ICo 1 2:6 There are many different forms of activity, but in everybody it is the same God who is at work in them 
all. 

ICo 12:7 The particular manifestation of the Spirit granted to each one is to be used for the general good. 

ICo 12:8 To one is given from the Spirit the gift of utterance expressing wisdom; to another the gift of utterance 
expressing knowledge, in accordance with the same Spirit; 

ICo 12:9 to another, faith, from the same Spirit; and to another, the gifts of healing, through this one Spirit; 

ICo 12:10 to another, the working of miracles; to another, prophecy; to another, the power of distinguishing 
spirits; to one, the gift of different tongues and to another, the interpretation of tongues. 

ICo 12:1 1 But at work in all these is one and the same Spirit, distributing them at will to each individual. 

ICo 12:12 For as with the human body which is a unity although it has many parts — all the parts of the body, 
though many, still making up one single body — so it is with Christ. 

ICo 12:13 We were baptised into one body in a single Spirit, Jews as well as Greeks, slaves as well as free 
men, and we were all given the same Spirit to drink. 

ICo 12:14 And indeed the body consists not of one member but of many. 

ICo 12:15 If the foot were to say, “I am not a hand and so I do not belong to the body”, it does not belong to the 
body any the less for that. 

ICo 12:16 Or if the ear were to say, “I am not an eye, and so I do not belong to the body”, that would not stop its 
belonging to the body. 

ICo 12:17 If the whole body were just an eye, how would there be any hearing? If the whole body were hearing, 
how would there be any smelling? 

ICo 12:18 As it is, God has put all the separate parts into the body as he chose. 

ICo 12:19 If they were all the same part, how could it be a body? 

ICo 12:20 As it is, the parts are many but the body is one. 

ICo 1 2:21 The eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you”, and nor can the head say to the feet, “I have 
no need of you”. 

1 Co 1 2:22 What is more, it is precisely the parts of the body that seem to be the weakest which are the 



indispensable ones. 

ICo 12:23 It is the parts of the body which we consider least dignified that we surround with the greatest dignity; 
and our less presentable parts are given greater presentability 

ICo 12:24 which our presentable parts do not need. God has composed the body so that greater dignity is 
given to the parts which were without it, 

ICo 12:25 and so that there may not be disagreements inside the body but each part may be equally concerned 
for all the others. 

ICo 12:26 If one part is hurt, all the parts share its pain. And if one part is honoured, all the parts share its joy. 

1 Co 1 2:27 Now Christ’s body is yourselves, each of you with a part to play in the whole. 

ICo 12:28 And those whom God has appointed in the Church are, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly 
teachers; after them, miraculous powers, then gifts of healing, helpful acts, guidance, various kinds of tongues. 
ICo 12:29 Are all of them apostles? Or all prophets? Or all teachers? Or all miracle-workers? 

1 Co 1 2:30 Do all have the gifts of healing? Do all of them speak in tongues and all interpret them? 

ICo 1 2:31 Set your mind on the higher gifts. And now I am going to put before you the best way of all. 

ICo 13:1 Though I command languages both human and angelic — if I speak without love, I am no more than a 
gong booming or a cymbal clashing. 

ICo 13:2 And though I have the power of prophecy, to penetrate all mysteries and knowledge, and though I 
have all the faith necessary to move mountains — if I am without love, I am nothing. 

ICo 13:3 Though I should give away to the poor all that I possess, and even give up my body to be burned — if I 
am without love, it will do me no good whatever. 

ICo 13:4 Love is always patient and kind; love is never jealous; love is not boastful or conceited, 

ICo 13:5 it is never rude and never seeks its own advantage, it does not take offence or store up grievances. 

1 Co 1 3:6 Love does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but finds its joy in the truth. 

ICo 13:7 It is always ready to make allowances, to trust, to hope and to endure whatever comes. 

ICo 13:8 Love never comes to an end. But if there are prophecies, they will be done away with; if tongues, they 
will fall silent; and if knowledge, it will be done away with. 

ICo 13:9 For we know only imperfectly, and we prophesy imperfectly; 

ICo 13:10 but once perfection comes, all imperfect things will be done away with. 

ICo 13:1 1 When I was a child, I used to talk like a child, and see things as a child does, and think like a child; 
but now that I have become an adult, I have finished with all childish ways. 

ICo 13:12 Now we see only reflections in a mirror, mere riddles, but then we shall be seeing face to face. Now I 
can know only imperfectly; but then I shall know just as fully as I am myself known. 

ICo 13:13 As it is, these remain: faith, hope and love, the three of them; and the greatest of them is love. 

ICo 14:1 Make love your aim; but be eager, too, for spiritual gifts, and especially for prophesying. 

ICo 14:2 Those who speak in a tongue speak to God, but not to other people, because nobody understands 
them; they are speaking in the Spirit and the meaning is hidden. 

ICo 14:3 On the other hand, someöne who prophesies speaks to other people, building them up and giving 
them encouragement and reassurance. 

ICo 14:4 Those who speak in a tongue may build themselves up, but those who prophesy build up the 
community. 

ICo 14:5 While I should like you all to speak in tongues, I would much rather you could prophesy; since those 
who prophesy are of greater importance than those who speak in tongues, unless they can interpret what they 
say so that the church is built up by it. 

ICo 14:6 Now suppose, brothers, I come to you and speak in tongues, what good shall I do you if my speaking 
provides no revelation or knowledge or prophecy or instruction? 

ICo 14:7 It is the same with an inanimate musical instrument. If it does not make any distinction between notes, 
how can one recognise what is being played on flute or lyre? 

ICo 14:8 If the trumpet sounds a call which is unrecognisable, who is going to get ready for the attack? 

ICo 14:9 It is the same with you: if you do not use your tongue to produce speech that can be readily 
understood, how can anyone know what you are saying? You will be talking to the air. 

ICo 14:10 However many the languages used in the world, all of them use sound; 

ICo 14:1 1 but if I do not understand the meaning of the sound, I am a barbarian to the person who is speaking, 
and the speaker is a barbarian to me. 

ICo 14:12 So with you, as you are eager to have spiritual powers, aim to be rich in those which build up the 
community. 

ICo 14:13 That is why anybody who speaks in a tongue must pray that he may be given the interpretation. 

ICo 14:14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit may be praying but my mind derives no fruit from it. 

ICo 14:15 What then? I shall pray with the spirit, but I shall pray with the mind as well: I shall sing praises with 
the spirit and I shall sing praises with the mind as well. 



ICo 14:16 Otherwise, if you say your blessing only with the spirit, how is the uninitiated person going to answer 
“Amen” to your thanksgiving, without understanding what you are saying? 

ICo 14:17 You may be making your thanksgiving well, but the other person is not built up at all. 

ICo 14:18 I thank God that I speak with tongues more than any of you; 

ICo 14:19 all the same, when I am in the assembly I would rather say five words with my mind, to instruct 
others as well, than ten thousand words in a tongue. 

ICo 14:20 Brothers, do not remain children in your thinking; infants in wickedness-agreed, but in your thinking 
grown-ups. 

ICo 14:21 It says in the written Law: In strange tongues and in a foreign language I will talk to this nation, and 
even so they will refuse to listen, says the Lord. 

ICo 14:22 So then, strange languages are significant not for believers, but for unbelievers; whereäs on the 
other hand, prophesying is not for unbelievers, but for believers. 

ICo 14:23 Suppose that, if the whole congregation were meeting and all of them speaking in tongues, and 
some uninitiated people or unbelievers were to come in, don’t you think they would say that you were all raving? 
ICo 14:24 But if you were all prophesying when an unbeliever or someöne uninitiated came in, he would find 
himself put to the test by all and judged by all 

ICo 14:25 and the secrets of his heart revealed; and so he would fall down on his face and worship God, 
declaring that God is indeed among you. 

1 Co 1 4:26 Then what should it be like, brothers? When you come together each of you brings a psalm or some 
instruction or a revelation, or speaks in a tongue or gives an interpretation. Let all these things be done in a way 
that will build up the community. 

1 Co 1 4:27 If there are to be any people speaking in a tongue, then let there be only two, or at the most three, 
and those one at a time, and let one of these interpret. 

ICo 14:28 If there is no interpreter, then let each of them be quiet in the assembly, and speak only to himself 
and God. 

1 Co 1 4:29 Let two prophets, or three, speak while the rest weigh their words; 

ICo 14:30 and if a revelation comes to someöne else who is sitting by, the speaker should stop speaking. 

ICo 14:31 You can all prophesy, but one at a time, then all will learn something and all receive encouragement. 
ICo 14:32 The prophetic spirit is to be under the prophets’ control, 

1 Co 1 4:33 for God is a God not of disorder but of peace. As in all the churches of God’s holy people, 

ICo 14:34 women are to remain quiet in the assemblies, since they have no permission to speak: theirs is a 
subordinate part, as the Law itself says. 

1 Co 1 4:35 If there is anything they want to know, they should ask their husbands at home: it is shameful for a 
woman to speak in the assembly. 

ICo 14:36 Do you really think that you are the source of the word of God? Or that you are the only people to 
whom it has come? 

ICo 14:37 Anyone who claims to be a prophet, or to have any spiritual powers must recognise that what I am 
writing to you is a commandment from the Lord. 

ICo 14:38 If anyone does not recognise this, it is because that person is not recognised himself. 

ICo 14:39 So, my brothers, be eager to prophesy, and do not suppress the gift of speaking in tongues. 

ICo 14:40 But make sure that everything is done in a proper and orderly fashion. 

ICo 15:1 I want to make quite clear to you, brothers, what the message of the gospel that I preached to you is; 
you accepted it and took your stand on it, 

ICo 15:2 and you are saved by it, if you keep to the message I preached to you; otherwise your coming to 
believe was in vain. 

ICo 15:3 The tradition I handed on to you in the first place, a tradition which I had myself received, was that 
Christ died for our sins, in accordance with the scriptures, 

ICo 15:4 and that he was buried; and that on the third day, he was raised to life, in accordance with the 
scriptures; 

ICo 15:5 and that he appeared to Cephas; and later to the Twelve; 

1 Co 1 5:6 and next he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time, most of whom are 
still with us, though some have fallen asleep; 

ICo 15:7 then he appeared to James, and then to all the apostles. 

1 Co 1 5:8 Last of all he appeared to me too, as though I was a child born abnormally. 

1 Co 1 5:9 For I am the least of the apostles and am not really fit to be called an apostle, because I had been 
persecuting the Church of God; 

ICo 15:10 but what I am now, I am through the grace of God, and the grace which was given to me has not 
been wasted. Indeed, I have worked harder than all the others — not I, but the grace of God which is with me. 
ICo 15:1 1 Anyway, whether it was they or I, this is what we preach and what you believed. 



ICo 15:12 Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you be saying that there is no 
resurrection of the dead? 

ICo 15:13 If there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ cannot have been raised either, 

ICo 15:14 and if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is without substance, and so is your faith. 

ICo 15:15 What is more, we have proved to be false witnesses to God, for testifying against God that he raised 
Christ to life when he did not raise him - if it is true that the dead are not raised. 

ICo 15:16 For, if the dead are not raised, neither is Christ; 

ICo 15:17 and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is pointless and you have not, after all, been released 
from your sins. 

ICo 15:18 In addition, those who have fallen asleep in Christ are utterly lost. 

ICo 15:19 If our hope in Christ has been for this life only, we are of all people the most pitiable. 

ICo 15:20 In fact, however, Christ has been raised from the dead, as the first-fruits of all who have fallen 
asleep. 

ICo 15:21 As it was by one man that death came, so through one man has come the resurrection of the dead. 
ICo 15:22 Just as all die in Adam, so in Christ all will be brought to life; 

ICo 15:23 but all of them in their proper order: Christ the first-fruits, and next, at his coming, those who belong 
to him. 

1 Co 1 5:24 After that will come the end, when he will hand over the kingdom to God the Father, having abolished 
every principality, every ruling force and power. 

ICo 15:25 For he is to be king until he has made his enemies his footstool, 

1 Co 1 5:26 and the last of the enemies to be done away with is death, for he has put all things under his feet. 

ICo 15:27 But when it is said everything is subjected, this obviously cannot include the One who subjected 

everything to him. 

ICo 15:28 When everything has been subjected to him, then the Son himself will be subjected to the One who 
has subjected everything to him, so that God may be all in all. 

1 Co 1 5:29 Otherwise, what are people up to who have themselves baptised on behalf of the dead? If the dead 
are not raised at all, what is the point of being baptised on their behalf? 

1 Co 1 5:30 And what about us? Why should we endanger ourselves every hour of our lives? 

ICo 15:31 I swear by the pride that I take in you, in Christ Jesus our Lord, that I face death every day. 

ICo 15:32 If I fought wild animals at Ephesus in a purely human perspective, what had I to gain by it? 

ICo 15:33 If the dead are not going to be raised, then Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall be dead. 

ICo 15:34 So do not let anyone lead you astray, “Bad company corrupts good ways”. Wake up from your stupor 
as you should and leave sin alone; some of you have no understanding of God; I tell you this to instil some 
shame in you. 

1 Co 1 5:35 Someöne may ask: Flow are dead people raised, and what sort of body do they have when they 
come? 

ICo 15:36 How foolish! What you sow must die before it is given new life; 

1 Co 1 5:37 and what you sow is not the body that is to be, but only a bare grain, of wheat I dare say, or some 
other kind; 

ICo 15:38 it is God who gives it the sort of body that he has chosen for it, and for each kind of seed its own kind 
of body. 

ICo 15:39 Not all flesh is the same flesh: there is human flesh; animals have another kind of flesh, birds another 
and fish yet another. 

ICo 15:40 Then there are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies; the heavenly have a splendour of their own, and 
the earthly a different splendour. 

1 Co 1 5:41 The sun has its own splendour, the moon another splendour, and the stars yet another splendour; 
and the stars differ among themselves in splendour. 

ICo 15:42 It is the same too with the resurrection of the dead: what is sown is perishable, but what is raised is 
imperishable; 

1 Co 1 5:43 what is sown is contemptible but what is raised is glorious; what is sown is weak, but what is raised 
is powerful; 

ICo 15:44 what is sown is a natural body, and what is raised is a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there 
is a spiritual body too. 

ICo 15:45 So the first man, Adam, as scripture says, became a living soul; and the last Adam has become a 
life-giving spirit. 

ICo 15:46 But first came the natural body, not the spiritual one; that came only afterwards. 

ICo 15:47 The first man, being made of earth, is earthly by nature; the second man is from heaven. 

ICo 15:48 The earthly man is the pattern for earthly people, the heavenly man for heavenly ones. 

ICo 15:49 And as we have borne the likeness of the earthly man, so we shall bear the likeness of the heavenly 



one. 

ICo 15:50 What I am saying, brothers, is that mere human nature cannot inherit the kingdom of God: what is 
perishable cannot inherit what is imperishable. 

ICo 15:51 Now I am going to tell you a mystery: we are not all going to fall asleep, 

1 Co 1 5:52 but we are all going to be changed, instantly, in the twinkling of an eye, when the last trumpet 
sounds. The trumpet is going to sound, and then the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be changed, 

1 Co 1 5:53 because this perishable nature of ours must put on imperishability, this mortal nature must put on 
immortality. 

ICo 15:54 And after this perishable nature has put on imperishability and this mortal nature has put on 
immortality, then will the words of scripture come true: Death is swallowed up in victory. 

1 Co 1 5:55 Death, where is your victory? Death, where is your sting? 

1 Co 1 5:56 The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin comes from the Law. 

1 Co 1 5:57 Thank God, then, for giving us the victory through Jesus Christ our Lord. 

1 Co 1 5:58 So, my dear brothers, keep firm and immovable, always abounding in energy for the Lord’s work, 
being sure that in the Lord none of your labours is wasted. 

ICo 16:1 Now about the collection for God’s holy people; you are to do the same as I prescribed for the 
churches in Galatia. 

1 Co 1 6:2 On the first day of the week, each of you should put aside and reserve as much as each can spare; do 
not delay the collection till I arrive. 

ICo 16:3 When I come, I will send to Jerusalem with letters of introduction those people you approve to deliver 
your gift; 

ICo 16:4 if it is worth my going too, they can travel with me. 

ICo 16:5 In any case, I shall be coming to you after I have passed through Macedonia, as I have to go through 
Macedonia; 

ICo 16:6 and I may be staying some time with you, perhaps wintering, so that you can start me on my next 
journey, wherever I may be going. 

1 Co 1 6:7 I do not want to make only a passing visit to you, and I am hoping to spend quite a time with you, the 
Lord permitting. 

ICo 16:8 But I shall remain at Ephesus until Pentecost, 

ICo 16:9 for a very promising door is standing wide open to me and there are many against us. 

ICo 16:10 If Timothy comes, make sure that he has nothing to fear from you; he is doing the Lord’s work, just 
as I am, 

ICo 16:1 1 and nobody is to underrate him. Start him off in peace on his journey to come on to me: the brothers 
and I are waiting for him. 

ICo 16:12 As for our brother Apollos, I urged him earnestly to come to you with the brothers, but he was quite 
firm that he did not want to go yet, and he will come when he finds an opportunity. 

ICo 16:13 Be vigilant, stay firm in the faith, be brave and strong. 

ICo 16:14 Let everything you do be done in love. 

ICo 16:15 There is something else I must urge you to do, brothers. You know how Stephanas’ family have been 
the first-fruits of Achaia and have devoted themselves to the service of God’s holy people; 

ICo 16:16 I ask you in turn to put yourselves at the service of people like this and all that work with them in this 
arduous task. 

ICo 16:17 I am delighted that Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus have arrived; they have made up for 
your not being here. 

ICo 16:18 They have set my mind at rest, just as they did yours; you should appreciate people like them. 

ICo 16:19 The churches of Asia send their greetings. Aquila and Prisca send their best wishes in the Lord, 
together with the church that meets in their house. 

ICo 16:20 All the brothers send their greetings. Greet one another with the holy kiss. 

ICo 16:21 This greeting is in my own hand-PAUL. 

ICo 16:22 If there is anyone who does not love the Lord, a curse on such a one. Maran atha. 

ICo 16:23 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you. 

ICo 16:24 My love is with you all in Christ Jesus.
