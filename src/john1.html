<h2 id="int">Introduction (1:1–4)</h2>

<h4>The Incarnate Word and sharing with the Father and the Son (1:1–4)</h4>

<p class="poem">
<span>Something which has existed since the beginning,</span><br /> 
<span>which we have heard,</span><br />
<span>which we have seen with our own eyes,</span><br />
<span>which we have watched</span><br />
<span>and touched with our own hands,</span><br />
<span>the Word of life —</span><br />
<span>this is our theme.</span><br />
<span>That life was made visible;</span><br />
<span>we saw it and are giving our testimony,</span><br />
<span>declaring to you the eternal life,</span><br />
<span>which was present to the Father</span><br />
<span>and has been revealed to us.</span><br />
<span>We are declaring to you</span><br />
<span>what we have seen and heard,</span><br />
<span>so that you too may share our life.</span><br />
<span>Our life is shared with the Father</span><br />
<span>and with his Son Jesus Christ.</span><br />
<span>We are writing this to you so that our joy may be complete. </span>
</p>

<h2 id="i">I: To Walk in the Light (1:5–2:28)</h2>

<p class="poem">
<span>This is what we have heard from him</span><br />
<span>and are declaring to you:</span><br />
<span>God is light, and there is no darkness in him at all.</span><br />
<span>If we say that we share in God’s life</span><br />
<span>while we are living in darkness,</span><br />
<span>we are lying, because we are not living the truth.</span><br />
<span>But if we live in light,</span><br />
<span>as he is in light,</span><br />
<span>we have a share in another’s life,</span><br />
<span>and the blood of Jesus, his Son,</span><br />
<span>cleanses us from all sin. </span>
</p>

<h4>First condition: to break with sin (1:8–2:2)</h4>

<p class="poem">
<span>If we say, “We have no sin”,</span><br />
<span>we are deceiving ourselves,</span><br />
<span>and truth has no place in us;</span><br />
<span>if we acknowledge our sins,</span><br />
<span>he is trustworthy and upright,</span><br />
<span>so that he will forgive our sins</span><br />
<span>and will cleanse us from all evil.</span><br />
<span>If we say, “We have never sinned”,</span><br />
<span>we make him a liar,</span><br />
<span>and his word has no place in us.</span><br />
<span>My children, I am writing this to prevent you from sinning;</span><br />
<span>but if anyone does sin,</span><br />
<span>we have an advocate with the Father,</span><br />
<span>Jesus Christ, the upright.</span><br />
<span>He is the sacrifice to expiate our sins,</span><br />
<span>and not only ours,</span><br />
<span>but also those of the whole world. </span>
</p>

<h4>Second condition: to keep the commandments, especially that of love (2:3–11)</h4>

<p class="poem">
<span>In this way we know</span><br />
<span>that we have come to know him,</span><br />
<span>if we keep his commandments.</span><br />
<span>Whoëver says, “I know him”</span><br />
<span>without keeping his commandments,</span><br />
<span>is a liar,</span><br />
<span>and truth has no place in him.</span><br />
<span>But anyone who does keep his word,</span><br />
<span>in such a one God’s love truly reaches its perfection.</span><br />
<span>This is the proof</span><br />
<span>that we are in God.</span><br />
<span>Whoëver claims to remain in him</span><br />
<span>must act as he acted.</span><br />
<span>My dear friends,</span><br />
<span>this is not a new commandment I am writing for you,</span><br />
<span>but an old commandment</span><br />
<span>that you have had from the beginning;</span><br />
<span>the old commandment is the message you have heard.</span><br />
<span>Yet in another way, I am writing a new commandment for you</span><br />
<span>— and this is true for you, just as much as for him —</span><br />
<span>for darkness is passing away</span><br />
<span>and the true light is already shining.</span><br />
<span>Whoëver claims to be in light</span><br />
<span>but hates his brother</span><br />
<span>is still in darkness.</span><br />
<span>Anyone who loves his brother remains in light</span><br />
<span>and there is in him nothing to make him fall away.</span><br />
<span>But whoëver hates his brother is in darkness</span><br />
<span>and is walking about in darkness</span><br />
<span>not knowing where he is going,</span><br />
<span>because darkness has blinded him. </span>
</p>

<h4>Third condition: detachment from the world (2:12–17)</h4>

<p class="poem">
<span>I am writing to you, children,</span><br />
<span>because your sins have been forgiven through his name.</span><br />
<span>I am writing to you, fathers,</span><br />
<span>because you have come to know the One who has existed since the beginning.</span><br />
<span>I am writing to you, young people,</span><br />
<span>because you have overcome the Evil One.</span><br />
<span>I have written to you, children,</span><br />
<span>because you have come to know the Father.</span><br />
<span>I have written to you, parents,</span><br />
<span>because you have come to know the One who has existed since the beginning.</span><br />
<span>I have written to you, young people,</span><br />
<span>because you are strong,</span><br />
<span>and God’s word remains in you,</span><br />
<span>and you have overcome the Evil One.</span><br />
<span>Do not love the world</span><br />
<span>or what is in the world.</span><br />
<span>If anyone does love the world,</span><br />
<span>the love of the Father finds no place in him,</span><br />
<span>because everything there is in the world —</span><br />
<span>disordered bodily desires,</span><br />
<span>disordered desires of the eyes,</span><br />
<span>pride in possession —</span><br />
<span>is not from the Father</span><br />
<span>but is from the world.</span><br />
<span>And the world, with all its disordered desires,</span><br />
<span>is passing away.</span><br />
<span>But whoëver does the will of God</span><br />
<span>remains for ever. </span>
</p>

<h4>Fourth condition: to be on guard against Antichrists (2:18–28)</h4>

<p class="poem">
<span>Children, this is the final hour;</span><br />
<span>you have heard that the Antichrist is coming,</span><br />
<span>and now many Antichrists have already come;</span><br />
<span>from this we know that it is the final hour.</span><br />
<span>They have gone from among us,</span><br />
<span>but they never really belonged to us;</span><br />
<span>if they had belonged to us, they would have stayed with us.</span><br />
<span>But this was to prove</span><br />
<span>that not one of them belonged to us.</span><br />
<span>But you have been anointed by the Holy One,</span><br />
<span>and have all received knowledge.</span><br />
<span>I have written to you</span><br />
<span>not because you are ignorant of the truth,</span><br />
<span>but because you are well aware of it,</span><br />
<span>and because no lie can come from the truth.</span><br />
<span>Who is the liar,</span><br />
<span>if not one who claims that Jesus is not the Christ?</span><br />
<span>This is the Antichrist,</span><br />
<span>who denies both the Father and the Son.</span><br />
<span>Whoëver denies the Son cannot have the Father either;</span><br />
<span>whoëver acknowledges the Son has the Father too.</span><br />
<span>Let what you heard in the beginning remain in you;</span><br />
<span>as long as what you heard in the beginning remains in you,</span><br />
<span>you will remain in the Son</span><br />
<span>and in the Father.</span><br />
<span>And the promise he made you himself</span><br />
<span>is eternal life.</span><br />
<span>So much have I written to you</span><br />
<span>about those who are trying to lead you astray.</span><br />
<span>But as for you, the anointing you received from him</span><br />
<span>remains in you,</span><br />
<span>and you do not need anyone to teach you;</span><br />
<span>since the anointing he gave you teaches you everything,</span><br />
<span>and since it is true, not false,</span><br />
<span>remain in him just as he has taught you.</span><br />
<span>Therefore remain in him now, children,</span><br />
<span>so that when he appears we may be fearless,</span><br />
<span>and not shrink from him in shame</span><br />
<span>at his coming. </span>
</p>

<h2 id="ii">II: To Live as God’s Children (2:29–4:6)</h2>


<p class="poem">
<span>If you know that he is upright</span><br />
<span>you must recognise that everyone whose life is upright</span><br />
<span>is a child of his.</span><br />
<span>You must see what great love the Father has lavished on us</span><br />
<span>by letting us be called God’s children —</span><br />
<span>which is what we are!</span><br />
<span>The reason why the world does not acknowledge us</span><br />
<span>is that it did not acknowledge him.</span><br />
<span>My dear friends, we are already God’s children,</span><br />
<span>but what we shall be in the future has not yet been revealed.</span><br />
<span>We are well aware that when he appears</span><br />
<span>we shall be like him,</span><br />
<span>because we shall see him as he really is. </span>
</p>

<h4>First condition: to break with sin (3:3–10)</h4>

<p class="poem">
<span>Whoëver treasures this hope of him</span><br />
<span>purifies himself, to be as pure as he is.</span><br />
<span>Whoëver sins, acts wickedly,</span><br />
<span>because all sin is wickedness.</span><br />
<span>Now you are well aware that he has appeared in order to take sins away,</span><br />
<span>and that in him there is no sin.</span><br />
<span>No one who remains in him sins,</span><br />
<span>and whoëver sins</span><br />
<span>has neither seen him nor recognised him.</span><br />
<span>Children, do not let anyone lead you astray.</span><br />
<span>Whoëver acts uprightly is upright,</span><br />
<span>just as he is upright.</span><br />
<span>Whoëver lives sinfully belongs to the devil,</span><br />
<span>since the devil has been a sinner from the beginning.</span><br />
<span>This was the purpose of the appearing of the Son of God,</span><br />
<span>to undo the work of the devil.</span><br />
<span>No one who is a child of God sins</span><br />
<span>because God’s seed remains in him.</span><br />
<span>Nor can he sin, because he is a child of God.</span><br />
<span>This is what distinguishes</span><br />
<span>the children of God from the children of the devil:</span><br />
<span>whoëver does not live uprightly</span><br />
<span>and does not love his brother</span><br />
<span>is not from God. </span>
</p>

<h4>Second condition: to keep the commandments, especially that of love (3:11–24)</h4>

<p class="poem">
<span>This is the message</span><br />
<span>which you heard from the beginning,</span><br />
<span>that we must love one another,</span><br />
<span>not to be like Cain, who was from the Evil One</span><br />
<span>and murdered his brother.</span><br />
<span>And why did he murder his brother?</span><br />
<span>Because his own actions were evil and his brother’s upright.</span><br />
<span>Do not be surprised, brothers,</span><br />
<span>if the world hates you.</span><br />
<span>We are well aware that we have passed over from death to life</span><br />
<span>because we love our brothers.</span><br />
<span>Whoëver does not love, remains in death.</span><br />
<span>Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer,</span><br />
<span>and you are well aware that no murderer</span><br />
<span>has eternal life remaining in him.</span><br />
<span>This is the proof of love,</span><br />
<span>that he laid down his life for us,</span><br />
<span>and we too ought to lay down our lives for our brothers.</span><br />
<span>If anyone is well-off in worldly possessions</span><br />
<span>and sees his brother in need</span><br />
<span>but closes his heart to him,</span><br />
<span>how can the love of God be remaining in him?</span><br />
<span>Children,</span><br />
<span>our love must be not just words or mere talk,</span><br />
<span>but something active and genuine.</span><br />
<span>This will be the proof that we belong to the truth,</span><br />
<span>and it will convince us in his presence,</span><br />
<span>even if our own feelings condemn us,</span><br />
<span>that God is greater than our feelings and knows all things.</span><br />
<span>My dear friends,</span><br />
<span>if our own feelings do not condemn us,</span><br />
<span>we can be fearless before God,</span><br />
<span>and whatever we ask</span><br />
<span>we shall receive from him,</span><br />
<span>because we keep his commandments</span><br />
<span>and do what is acceptable to him.</span><br />
<span>His commandment is this,</span><br />
<span>that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ</span><br />
<span>and that we should love one another</span><br />
<span>as he commanded us.</span><br />
<span>Whoëver keeps his commandments</span><br />
<span>remains in God, and God in him.</span><br />
<span>And this is the proof that he remains in us:</span><br />
<span>the Spirit that he has given us. </span>
</p>

<h4>Third condition: to be on guard against Antichrists and against the world (4:1–6)</h4>

<p class="poem">
<span>My dear friends,</span><br />
<span>not every spirit is to be trusted,</span><br />
<span>but test the spirits to see whether they are from God,</span><br />
<span>for many false prophets are at large in the world.</span><br />
<span>This is the proof of the spirit of God:</span><br />
<span>any spirit which acknowledges Jesus Christ, come in human nature,</span><br />
<span>is from God,</span><br />
<span>and no spirit which fails to acknowledge Jesus</span><br />
<span>is from God;</span><br />
<span>it is the spirit of Antichrist,</span><br />
<span>whose coming you have heard of;</span><br />
<span>he is already at large in the world.</span><br />
<span>Children, you are from God</span><br />
<span>and have overcome them,</span><br />
<span>because he who is in you</span><br />
<span>is greater than he who is in the world.</span><br />
<span>They are from the world,</span><br />
<span>and therefore the world inspires what they say,</span><br />
<span>and listens to them.</span><br />
<span>We are from God;</span><br />
<span>whoëver recognises God listens to us;</span><br />
<span>anyone who is not from God refuses to listen to us.</span><br />
<span>This is how we can distinguish</span><br />
<span>the spirit of truth from the spirit of falsehood.
</span>
</p>

<h2 id="iii">III: The Source of Love and Faith (4:7–5:13)</h2>

<h4>The source of love (4:7–5:4)</h4>

<p class="poem">
<span>My dear friends,</span><br />
<span>let us love one another,</span><br />
<span>since love is from God</span><br />
<span>and everyone who loves is a child of God and knows God.</span><br />
<span>Whoëver fails to love does not know God,</span><br />
<span>because God is love.</span><br />
<span>This is the revelation of God’s love for us,</span><br />
<span>that God sent his only Son into the world</span><br />
<span>that we might have life through him.</span><br />
<span>Love consists in this:</span><br />
<span>it is not we who loved God,</span><br />
<span>but God loved us and sent his Son</span><br />
<span>to expiate our sins.</span><br />
<span>My dear friends,</span><br />
<span>if God loved us so much,</span><br />
<span>we too should love one another.</span><br />
<span>No one has ever seen God,</span><br />
<span>but as long as we love one another</span><br />
<span>God remains in us</span><br />
<span>and his love comes to its perfection in us.</span><br />
<span>This is the proof that we remain in him</span><br />
<span>and he in us,</span><br />
<span>that he has given us a share in his Spirit.</span><br />
<span>We ourselves have seen and testify</span><br />
<span>that the Father sent his Son</span><br />
<span>as Saviour of the world.</span><br />
<span>Anyone who acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God,</span><br />
<span>God remains in him and he in God.</span><br />
<span>We have recognised for ourselves,</span><br />
<span>and put our faith in, the love God has for us.</span><br />
<span>God is love,</span><br />
<span>and whoëver remains in love remains in God</span><br />
<span>and God in him.</span><br />
<span>Love comes to its perfection in us</span><br />
<span>when we can face the Day of Judgement fearlessly,</span><br />
<span>because even in this world</span><br />
<span>we have become as he is.</span><br />
<span>In love there is no room for fear,</span><br />
<span>but perfect love drives out fear,</span><br />
<span>because fear implies punishment</span><br />
<span>and no one who is afraid has come to perfection in love.</span><br />
<span>Let us love, then,</span><br />
<span>because he first loved us.</span><br />
<span>Anyone who says “I love God”</span><br />
<span>and hates his brother,</span><br />
<span>is a liar,</span><br />
<span>since whoëver does not love the brother whom he can see</span><br />
<span>cannot love God whom he has not seen.</span><br />
<span>Indeed this is the commandment we have received from him,</span><br />
<span>that whoëver loves God, must also love his brother.</span><br />
<span>Whoëver believes that Jesus is the Christ</span><br />
<span>is a child of God,</span><br />
<span>and whoëver loves the father</span><br />
<span>loves the son.</span><br />
<span>In this way we know that we love God’s children,</span><br />
<span>when we love God and keep his commandments.</span><br />
<span>This is what the love of God is:</span><br />
<span>keeping his commandments.</span><br />
<span>Nor are his commandments burdensome,</span><br />
<span>because every child of God</span><br />
<span>overcomes the world.</span><br />
<span>And this is the victory that has overcome the world —</span><br />
<span>our faith. </span>
</p>

<h4>The source of faith (5:5–13)</h4>

<p class="poem">
<span>Who can overcome the world</span><br />
<span>but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</span><br />
<span>He it is who came by water and blood,</span><br />
<span>Jesus Christ,</span><br />
<span>not with water alone</span><br />
<span>but with water and blood,</span><br />
<span>and it is the Spirit that bears witness,</span><br />
<span>for the Spirit is Truth.</span><br />
<span>So there are three witnesses,</span><br />
<span>the Spirit, water and blood;</span><br />
<span>and the three of them coincide.</span><br />
<span>If we accept the testimony of human witnesses,</span><br />
<span>God’s testimony is greater,</span><br />
<span>for this is God’s testimony</span><br />
<span>which he gave about his Son.</span><br />
<span>Whoëver believes in the Son of God</span><br />
<span>has this testimony within him,</span><br />
<span>and whoëver does not believe</span><br />
<span>is making God a liar,</span><br />
<span>because he has not believed</span><br />
<span>the testimony God has given about his Son.</span><br />
<span>This is the testimony:</span><br />
<span>God has given us eternal life,</span><br />
<span>and this life is in his Son.</span><br />
<span>Whoëver has the Son has life,</span><br />
<span>and whoëver has not the Son of God has not life.</span><br />
<span>I have written this to you</span><br />
<span>who believe in the name of the Son of God</span><br />
<span>so that you may know that you have eternal life. </span>
</p>

<h2 id="sup">Supplements (5:14–21)</h2>

<h4>Prayer for sinners (5:14–17)</h4>

<p class="poem">
<span>Our fearlessness towards him consists in this,</span><br />
<span>that if we ask anything in accordance with his will</span><br />
<span>he hears us.</span><br />
<span>And if we know that he listens to whatever we ask him,</span><br />
<span>we know that we already possess whatever we have asked of him.</span><br />
<span>If anyone sees his brother commit a sin</span><br />
<span>that is not a deadly sin,</span><br />
<span>he has only to pray, and God will give life to this brother</span><br />
<span>— provided that it is not a deadly sin.</span><br />
<span>There is sin that leads to death</span><br />
<span>and I am not saying you must pray about that.</span><br />
<span>Every kind of wickedness is sin,</span><br />
<span>but not all sin leads to death. </span>
</p>

<h4>Summary of the letter (5:18–21)</h4>

<p class="poem">
<span>We are well aware that no one who is a child of God sins,</span><br />
<span>because he who was born from God protects him,</span><br />
<span>and the Evil One has no hold over him.</span><br />
<span>We are well aware that we are from God,</span><br />
<span>and the whole world is in the power of the Evil One.</span><br />
<span>We are well aware also that the Son of God has come,</span><br />
<span>and has given us understanding</span><br />
<span>so that we may know the One who is true.</span><br />
<span>We are in the One who is true</span><br />
<span>as we are in his Son, Jesus Christ.</span><br />
<span>He is the true God</span><br />
<span>and this is eternal life.</span><br />
<span>Children, be on your guard against false gods. </span>
</p>
