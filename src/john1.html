<h2 id="int">Introduction (1:1–4)</h2>

<h4>The Incarnate Word and sharing with the Father and the Son (1:1–4)</h4>

<p>Something which has existed since the beginning, <br /> 
which we have heard, <br />
which we have seen with our own eyes, <br />
which we have watched <br />
and touched with our own hands, <br />
the Word of life — <br />
this is our theme. <br />
That life was made visible; <br />
we saw it and are giving our testimony, <br />
declaring to you the eternal life, <br />
which was present to the Father <br />
and has been revealed to us. <br />
We are declaring to you <br />
what we have seen and heard, <br />
so that you too may share our life. <br />
Our life is shared with the Father <br />
and with his Son Jesus Christ. <br />
We are writing this to you so that our joy may be complete. </p>

<h2 id="i">I: To Walk in the Light (1:5–2:28)</h2>

<p>This is what we have heard from him <br />
and are declaring to you: <br />
God is light, and there is no darkness in him at all. <br />
If we say that we share in God’s life <br />
while we are living in darkness, <br />
we are lying, because we are not living the truth. <br />
But if we live in light, <br />
as he is in light, <br />
we have a share in another’s life, <br />
and the blood of Jesus, his Son, <br />
cleanses us from all sin. </p>

<h4>First condition: to break with sin (1:8–2:2)</h4>

<p>If we say, “We have no sin”, <br />
we are deceiving ourselves, <br />
and truth has no place in us; <br />
if we acknowledge our sins, <br />
he is trustworthy and upright, <br />
so that he will forgive our sins <br />
and will cleanse us from all evil. <br />
If we say, “We have never sinned”, <br />
we make him a liar, <br />
and his word has no place in us. <br />
My children, I am writing this to prevent you from sinning; <br />
but if anyone does sin, <br />
we have an advocate with the Father, <br />
Jesus Christ, the upright. <br />
He is the sacrifice to expiate our sins, <br />
and not only ours, <br />
but also those of the whole world. </p>

<h4>Second condition: to keep the commandments, especially that of love (2:3–11)</h4>

<p>In this way we know <br />
that we have come to know him, <br />
if we keep his commandments. <br />
Whoëver says, “I know him” <br />
without keeping his commandments, <br />
is a liar, <br />
and truth has no place in him. <br />
But anyone who does keep his word, <br />
in such a one God’s love truly reaches its perfection. <br />
This is the proof <br />
that we are in God. <br />
Whoëver claims to remain in him <br />
must act as he acted. <br />
My dear friends, <br />
this is not a new commandment I am writing for you, <br />
but an old commandment <br />
that you have had from the beginning; <br />
the old commandment is the message you have heard. <br />
Yet in another way, I am writing a new commandment for you <br />
— and this is true for you, just as much as for him — <br />
for darkness is passing away <br />
and the true light is already shining. <br />
Whoëver claims to be in light <br />
but hates his brother <br />
is still in darkness. <br />
Anyone who loves his brother remains in light <br />
and there is in him nothing to make him fall away. <br />
But whoëver hates his brother is in darkness <br />
and is walking about in darkness <br />
not knowing where he is going, <br />
because darkness has blinded him. </p>

<h4>Third condition: detachment from the world (2:12–17)</h4>

<p>I am writing to you, children, <br />
because your sins have been forgiven through his name. <br />
I am writing to you, fathers, <br />
because you have come to know the One who has existed since the beginning. <br />
I am writing to you, young people, <br />
because you have overcome the Evil One. <br />
I have written to you, children, <br />
because you have come to know the Father. <br />
I have written to you, parents, <br />
because you have come to know the One who has existed since the beginning. <br />
I have written to you, young people, <br />
because you are strong, <br />
and God’s word remains in you, <br />
and you have overcome the Evil One. <br />
Do not love the world <br />
or what is in the world. <br />
If anyone does love the world, <br />
the love of the Father finds no place in him, <br />
because everything there is in the world — <br />
disordered bodily desires, <br />
disordered desires of the eyes, <br />
pride in possession — <br />
is not from the Father <br />
but is from the world. <br />
And the world, with all its disordered desires, <br />
is passing away. <br />
But whoëver does the will of God <br />
remains for ever. </p>

<h4>Fourth condition: to be on guard against Antichrists (2:18–28)</h4>

<p>Children, this is the final hour; <br />
you have heard that the Antichrist is coming, <br />
and now many Antichrists have already come; <br />
from this we know that it is the final hour. <br />
They have gone from among us, <br />
but they never really belonged to us; <br />
if they had belonged to us, they would have stayed with us. <br />
But this was to prove <br />
that not one of them belonged to us. <br />
But you have been anointed by the Holy One, <br />
and have all received knowledge. <br />
I have written to you <br />
not because you are ignorant of the truth, <br />
but because you are well aware of it, <br />
and because no lie can come from the truth. <br />
Who is the liar, <br />
if not one who claims that Jesus is not the Christ? <br />
This is the Antichrist, <br />
who denies both the Father and the Son. <br />
Whoëver denies the Son cannot have the Father either; <br />
whoëver acknowledges the Son has the Father too. <br />
Let what you heard in the beginning remain in you; <br />
as long as what you heard in the beginning remains in you, <br />
you will remain in the Son <br />
and in the Father. <br />
And the promise he made you himself <br />
is eternal life. <br />
So much have I written to you <br />
about those who are trying to lead you astray. <br />
But as for you, the anointing you received from him <br />
remains in you, <br />
and you do not need anyone to teach you; <br />
since the anointing he gave you teaches you everything, <br />
and since it is true, not false, <br />
remain in him just as he has taught you. <br />
Therefore remain in him now, children, <br />
so that when he appears we may be fearless, <br />
and not shrink from him in shame <br />
at his coming. </p>

<h2 id="ii">II: To Live as God’s Children (2:29–4:6)</h2>


<p>If you know that he is upright <br />
you must recognise that everyone whose life is upright <br />
is a child of his. <br />
You must see what great love the Father has lavished on us <br />
by letting us be called God’s children — <br />
which is what we are! <br />
The reason why the world does not acknowledge us <br />
is that it did not acknowledge him. <br />
My dear friends, we are already God’s children, <br />
but what we shall be in the future has not yet been revealed. <br />
We are well aware that when he appears <br />
we shall be like him, <br />
because we shall see him as he really is. </p>

<h4>First condition: to break with sin (3:3–10)</h4>

<p>Whoëver treasures this hope of him <br />
purifies himself, to be as pure as he is. <br />
Whoëver sins, acts wickedly, <br />
because all sin is wickedness. <br />
Now you are well aware that he has appeared in order to take sins away, <br />
and that in him there is no sin. <br />
No one who remains in him sins, <br />
and whoëver sins <br />
has neither seen him nor recognised him. <br />
Children, do not let anyone lead you astray. <br />
Whoëver acts uprightly is upright, <br />
just as he is upright. <br />
Whoëver lives sinfully belongs to the devil, <br />
since the devil has been a sinner from the beginning. <br />
This was the purpose of the appearing of the Son of God, <br />
to undo the work of the devil. <br />
No one who is a child of God sins <br />
because God’s seed remains in him. <br />
Nor can he sin, because he is a child of God. <br />
This is what distinguishes <br />
the children of God from the children of the devil: <br />
whoëver does not live uprightly <br />
and does not love his brother <br />
is not from God. </p>

<h4>Second condition: to keep the commandments, especially that of love (3:11–24)</h4>

<p>This is the message <br />
which you heard from the beginning, <br />
that we must love one another, <br />
not to be like Cain, who was from the Evil One <br />
and murdered his brother. <br />
And why did he murder his brother? <br />
Because his own actions were evil and his brother’s upright. <br />
Do not be surprised, brothers, <br />
if the world hates you. <br />
We are well aware that we have passed over from death to life <br />
because we love our brothers. <br />
Whoëver does not love, remains in death. <br />
Anyone who hates his brother is a murderer, <br />
and you are well aware that no murderer <br />
has eternal life remaining in him. <br />
This is the proof of love, <br />
that he laid down his life for us, <br />
and we too ought to lay down our lives for our brothers. <br />
If anyone is well-off in worldly possessions <br />
and sees his brother in need <br />
but closes his heart to him, <br />
how can the love of God be remaining in him? <br />
Children, <br />
our love must be not just words or mere talk, <br />
but something active and genuine. <br />
This will be the proof that we belong to the truth, <br />
and it will convince us in his presence, <br />
even if our own feelings condemn us, <br />
that God is greater than our feelings and knows all things. <br />
My dear friends, <br />
if our own feelings do not condemn us, <br />
we can be fearless before God, <br />
and whatever we ask <br />
we shall receive from him, <br />
because we keep his commandments <br />
and do what is acceptable to him. <br />
His commandment is this, <br />
that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ <br />
and that we should love one another <br />
as he commanded us. <br />
Whoëver keeps his commandments <br />
remains in God, and God in him. <br />
And this is the proof that he remains in us: <br />
the Spirit that he has given us. </p>

<h4>Third condition: to be on guard against Antichrists and against the world (4:1–6)</h4>

<p>My dear friends, <br />
not every spirit is to be trusted, <br />
but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, <br />
for many false prophets are at large in the world. <br />
This is the proof of the spirit of God: <br />
any spirit which acknowledges Jesus Christ, come in human nature, <br />
is from God, <br />
and no spirit which fails to acknowledge Jesus <br />
is from God; <br />
it is the spirit of Antichrist, <br />
whose coming you have heard of; <br />
he is already at large in the world. <br />
Children, you are from God <br />
and have overcome them, <br />
because he who is in you <br />
is greater than he who is in the world. <br />
They are from the world, <br />
and therefore the world inspires what they say, <br />
and listens to them. <br />
We are from God; <br />
whoëver recognises God listens to us; <br />
anyone who is not from God refuses to listen to us. <br />
This is how we can distinguish <br />
the spirit of truth from the spirit of falsehood.
</p>

<h2 id="iii">III: The Source of Love and Faith (4:7–5:13)</h2>

<h4>The source of love (4:7–5:4)</h4>

<p>My dear friends, <br />
let us love one another, <br />
since love is from God <br />
and everyone who loves is a child of God and knows God. <br />
Whoëver fails to love does not know God, <br />
because God is love. <br />
This is the revelation of God’s love for us, <br />
that God sent his only Son into the world <br />
that we might have life through him. <br />
Love consists in this: <br />
it is not we who loved God, <br />
but God loved us and sent his Son <br />
to expiate our sins. <br />
My dear friends, <br />
if God loved us so much, <br />
we too should love one another. <br />
No one has ever seen God, <br />
but as long as we love one another <br />
God remains in us <br />
and his love comes to its perfection in us. <br />
This is the proof that we remain in him <br />
and he in us, <br />
that he has given us a share in his Spirit. <br />
We ourselves have seen and testify <br />
that the Father sent his Son <br />
as Saviour of the world. <br />
Anyone who acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, <br />
God remains in him and he in God. <br />
We have recognised for ourselves, <br />
and put our faith in, the love God has for us. <br />
God is love, <br />
and whoëver remains in love remains in God <br />
and God in him. <br />
Love comes to its perfection in us <br />
when we can face the Day of Judgement fearlessly, <br />
because even in this world <br />
we have become as he is. <br />
In love there is no room for fear, <br />
but perfect love drives out fear, <br />
because fear implies punishment <br />
and no one who is afraid has come to perfection in love. <br />
Let us love, then, <br />
because he first loved us. <br />
Anyone who says “I love God” <br />
and hates his brother, <br />
is a liar, <br />
since whoëver does not love the brother whom he can see <br />
cannot love God whom he has not seen. <br />
Indeed this is the commandment we have received from him, <br />
that whoëver loves God, must also love his brother. <br />
Whoëver believes that Jesus is the Christ <br />
is a child of God, <br />
and whoëver loves the father <br />
loves the son. <br />
In this way we know that we love God’s children, <br />
when we love God and keep his commandments. <br />
This is what the love of God is: <br />
keeping his commandments. <br />
Nor are his commandments burdensome, <br />
because every child of God <br />
overcomes the world. <br />
And this is the victory that has overcome the world — <br />
our faith. </p>

<h4>The source of faith (5:5–13)</h4>

<p>Who can overcome the world <br />
but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God? <br />
He it is who came by water and blood, <br />
Jesus Christ, <br />
not with water alone <br />
but with water and blood, <br />
and it is the Spirit that bears witness, <br />
for the Spirit is Truth. <br />
So there are three witnesses, <br />
the Spirit, water and blood; <br />
and the three of them coincide. <br />
If we accept the testimony of human witnesses, <br />
God’s testimony is greater, <br />
for this is God’s testimony <br />
which he gave about his Son. <br />
Whoëver believes in the Son of God <br />
has this testimony within him, <br />
and whoëver does not believe <br />
is making God a liar, <br />
because he has not believed <br />
the testimony God has given about his Son. <br />
This is the testimony: <br />
God has given us eternal life, <br />
and this life is in his Son. <br />
Whoëver has the Son has life, <br />
and whoëver has not the Son of God has not life. <br />
I have written this to you <br />
who believe in the name of the Son of God <br />
so that you may know that you have eternal life. </p>

<h2 id="sup">Supplements (5:14–21)</h2>

<h4>Prayer for sinners (5:14–17)</h4>

<p>Our fearlessness towards him consists in this, <br />
that if we ask anything in accordance with his will <br />
he hears us. <br />
And if we know that he listens to whatever we ask him, <br />
we know that we already possess whatever we have asked of him. <br />
If anyone sees his brother commit a sin <br />
that is not a deadly sin, <br />
he has only to pray, and God will give life to this brother <br />
— provided that it is not a deadly sin. <br />
There is sin that leads to death <br />
and I am not saying you must pray about that. <br />
Every kind of wickedness is sin, <br />
but not all sin leads to death. </p>

<h4>Summary of the letter (5:18–21)</h4>

<p>We are well aware that no one who is a child of God sins, <br />
because he who was born from God protects him, <br />
and the Evil One has no hold over him. <br />
We are well aware that we are from God, <br />
and the whole world is in the power of the Evil One. <br />
We are well aware also that the Son of God has come, <br />
and has given us understanding <br />
so that we may know the One who is true. <br />
We are in the One who is true <br />
as we are in his Son, Jesus Christ. <br />
He is the true God <br />
and this is eternal life. <br />
Children, be on your guard against false gods. </p>
