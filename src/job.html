<h2 id="i">I: Prologue (1:1–2:13)</h2>

<h4>Satan tests Job (1:1–2:13)</h4>

<p>There was once a man in the land of Uz called Job: a sound and honest man who feared God and shunned evil. Seven sons and three daughters were born to him. And he owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred she-donkeys, and many servants besides. This man was the most prosperous of all the Sons of the East. It was the custom of his sons to hold banquets in one another’s houses in turn, and to invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. Once each series of banquets was over, Job would send for them to come and be purified, and at dawn on the following day he would make a burnt offering for each of them. “Perhaps”, Job would say, “my sons have sinned and in their heart blasphemed”. So that was what Job used to do each time. </p>

<p>One day when the sons of God came to attend on Yahweh, among them came Satan. So Yahweh said to Satan, “Where have you been?”. </p>

<p>“Prowling about on earth”, he answered, “roaming around there”. </p>

<p>So Yahweh asked him, “Did you pay any attention to my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth: a sound and honest man who fears God and shuns evil”. </p>

<p>“Yes”, Satan said, “but Job is not God-fearing for nothing, is he? Have you not put a wall around him and his house and all his domain? You have blessed all he undertakes, and his flocks throng the countryside. But stretch out your hand and lay a finger on his possessions: then, I warrant you, he will curse you to your face”. </p>

<p>“Very well”, Yahweh said to Satan, “all he has is in your power. But keep your hands off his person”. So Satan left the presence of Yahweh. </p>

<p>On the day when Job’s sons and daughters were eating and drinking in their eldest brother’s house, a messenger came to Job. “Your oxen”, he said, “were at the plough, with the donkeys grazing at their side, when the Sabaeans swept down on them and carried them off, and put the servants to the sword: I
alone have escaped to tell you”. He had not finished speaking when another messenger arrived. </p>

<p>“The fire of God”, he said, “has fallen from heaven and burnt the sheep and shepherds to ashes: I alone have escaped to tell you”. He had not finished speaking when another messenger arrived. </p>

<p>“The Chaldaeans”, he said, “three bands of them, have raided the camels and made off with them, and put the servants to the sword: I alone have escaped to tell you”. He had not finished speaking when another messenger arrived. </p>

<p>“Your sons and daughters”, he said, “were eating and drinking at their eldest brother’s house, when suddenly from the desert a gale sprang up, and it battered all four corners of the house which fell in on the young people. They are dead: I alone have escaped to tell you”. </p>

<p>Then Job stood up, tore his robe and shaved his head. Then, falling to the ground, he prostrated himself and said: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
	<span>Naked I came from my mother’s womb,</span><br />
	<span>naked I shall return again.</span><br />
	<span>Yahweh gave, Yahweh has taken back.</span><br />
	<span>Blessed be the name of Yahweh!</span><br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In all this misfortune Job committed no sin, and he did not reproach God. </p>

<p>Another day, the sons of God came to attend on Yahweh and Satan came with them too. So Yahweh said to Satan, “Where have you been?”. </p>

<p>“Prowling about on earth”, he answered, “roaming around there”. </p>

<p>So Yahweh asked him, “Did you pay any attention to my servant Job? There is no one like him on the earth: a sound and honest man who fears God and shuns evil. He persists in his integrity still; you achieved nothing by provoking me to ruin him”. </p>

<p>“Skin after skin!”, Satan replied. “Someone will give away all he has to save his life. But stretch out your hand and lay a finger on his bone and flesh; I warrant you, he will curse you to your face”. </p>

<p>“Very well”, Yahweh said to Satan, “he is in your power. But spare his life”. So Satan left the presence of Yahweh. </p>

<p>He struck Job down with malignant ulcers from the sole of his foot to the top of his head. Job took a piece of pot to scrape himself, and went and sat among the ashes. Then his wife said to him, “Why persist in this integrity of yours? Curse God and die”. </p>

<p>“That is how a fool of a woman talks”, Job replied. “If we take happiness from God’s hand, must we not take sorrow too?”. And in all this misfortune Job uttered no sinful word. </p>

<p>The news of all the disasters that had fallen on Job came to the ears of three of his friends. Each of them set out from home — Eliphaz of Teman, Bildad of Shuah and Zophar of Naamath — and by common consent they decided to go and offer him sympathy and consolation. Looking at him from a distance, they could not recognise him; they wept aloud and tore their robes and threw dust over their heads. They sat there on the ground beside him for seven days and seven nights. To Job they spoke never a word, for they saw how much he was suffering. </p>

<h4>Job curses the day of his birth (3:1–26)</h4>

<p>In the end it was Job who broke the silence and cursed the day of his birth. </p>

<p>This is what he said: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
	<span>Perish the day on which I was born</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the night that told of a boy conceived.</span><br />
	<span>May that day be darkness,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">may God on high have no thought for it,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">may no light shine on it.</span><br />
	<span>May murk and shadow dark as death claim it for their own,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">clouds hang over it,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">eclipse swoop down on it.</span><br />
	<span>See! Let obscurity seize on it,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">from the days of the year let it be excluded,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">into the reckoning of the months not find its way.</span><br />
	<span>And may that night be sterile,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">devoid of any cries of joy!</span><br />
	<span>Let it be cursed by those who curse certain days</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and are ready to rouse Leviathan.</span><br />
	<span>Dark be the stars of its morning,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">let it wait in vain for light</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and never see the opening eyes of dawn.</span><br />
	<span>Since it would not shut the doors of the womb on me</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to hide sorrow from my eyes.</span><br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
	<span>Why was I not still-born,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">or why did I not perish as I left the womb?</span><br />
	<span>Why were there knees to receive me,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">breasts for me to suck?</span><br />
	<span>Now I should be lying in peace,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">wrapped in a restful slumber,</span><br />
	<span>with the kings and high viziers of earth</span><br />
	<span class="i1">who have built their dwellings in desolate places,</span><br />
	<span>or with princes who have quantities of gold</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and silver cramming their tombs;</span><br />
	<span>or, put away like an abortive child, I should not have existed,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">like little ones that never see the light.</span><br />
	<span>Down there, the wicked bustle no more,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">there the weary rest.</span><br />
	<span>Prisoners, all left in peace,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">hear no more the shouts of the oppressor.</span><br />
	<span>High and low are there together,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the slave is free of his master.</span><br />
	<span>Why give light to a man of grief?</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Why give life to those bitter of heart,</span><br />
	<span>who long for a death that never comes,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and hunt for it more than for buried treasure?</span><br />
	<span>They would be glad to see the grave-mound</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and shout with joy if they reached the tomb.</span><br />
	<span>Why give light to one who does not see his way,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">whom God shuts in all alone?</span><br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
	<span>My only food is sighs,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and my groans pour out like water.</span><br />
	<span>Whatever I fear comes true,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">whatever I dread befalls me.</span><br />
	<span>For me, there is no calm, no peace;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">my torments banish rest.</span><br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Confidence in God (4:1–5:27)</h4>

<p>Eliphaz of Teman spoke next. He said: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
	<span>If we say something to you, will you bear with us?</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Who in any case could refrain from speaking now?</span><br />
	<span>You have schooled many others,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">giving strength to feeble hands;</span><br />
	<span>your words supported any who wavered</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and strengthened every failing knee.</span><br />
	<span>And now your turn has come, and you lose patience,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">at the first touch on yourself you are overwhelmed!</span><br />
	<span>Does not your piety give you confidence,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and your integrity of life give you hope?</span><br />
	<span>Can you recall anyone guiltless that perished?</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Where then have the honest been wiped out?</span><br />
	<span>I speak from experience: those who plough iniquity</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and sow disaster, reap just that.</span><br />
	<span>Under the breath of God, they perish:</span><br />
	<span class="i1">a blast of his anger, and they are destroyed;</span><br />
	<span>the lion’s roars, his savage growls,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">like the fangs of a lion cub, are broken off.</span><br />
	<span>The lion dies for lack of prey</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the lioness’s whelps are dispersed.</span><br />
	<span>I have received a secret revelation, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">a whisper has come to my ears;</span><br />
	<span>by night when dreams confuse the mind</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and slumber lies heavy on everyone,</span><br />
	<span>a shiver of horror ran through me</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and filled all my bones with fright.</span><br />
	<span>A breath slid over my face,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the hairs of my body bristled.</span><br />
	<span>Someone stood there — I did not know his face,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but the form stayed there before my eyes.</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Silence — then I heard a voice,</span><br />
	<span>“Can a mortal seem upright to God,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">would anybody seem pure in the presence of his Maker?</span><br />
	<span>God cannot rely even on his own servants,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">even with his angels he finds fault.</span><br />
	<span>What then of those who live in houses of clay,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">who are founded on dust?</span><br />
	<span>They are crushed as easily as a moth,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">between morning and evening they are ground to powder.</span><br />
	<span class="i1">They vanish for ever, with no one to bring them back.</span><br />
	<span>Their tent-peg is snatched from them,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and they die devoid of wisdom”.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
	<span>Make your appeal then. Will you find an answer?</span><br />
	<span class="i1">To which of the holy ones will you turn?</span><br />
	<span>Resentment kills the senseless,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and anger brings death to the fool.</span><br />
	<span>I have seen the senseless taking root,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">when a curse fell suddenly on his house.</span><br />
	<span>His children are deprived of prop and stay,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">ruined at the gate, and no one to defend them;</span><br />
	<span>their harvest goes to feed the hungry,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">God snatches it from their mouths,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and covetous people thirst for their possessions.</span><br />
	<span>No, misery does not grow out of the soil,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">nor sorrow spring from the ground.</span><br />
	<span>It is people who breed trouble for themselves</span><br />
	<span class="i1">as surely as eagles fly to the height.</span><br />
	<span>If I were you, I should appeal to God</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and lay my case before him.</span><br />
	<span>His works are great, past all reckoning,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">marvels beyond all counting.</span><br />
	<span>He sends down rain to the earth,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">pours down water on the fields.</span><br />
	<span>If his will is to raise up the downcast,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">or exalt the afflicted to the heights of prosperity,</span><br />
	<span>he frustrates the plans of the artful</span><br />
	<span class="i1">so that they cannot succeed in their intrigues.</span><br />
	<span>He traps the crafty in the snare of their own trickery,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">throws the plans of the cunning into disarray.</span><br />
	<span>In daylight they come up against darkness,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and grope their way as if noon were night.</span><br />
	<span>He rescues the bankrupt from their jaws,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the needy from the grasp of the mighty.</span><br />
	<span>Hope springs afresh for the weak,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and wickedness must shut its mouth.</span><br />

	<span>Six times he will deliver you from sorrow,</span><br />

	<span>You will laugh at drought and frost,</span><br />

<h4>Only the sufferer knows his own grief (6:1–7:21)</h4>

<p>Job spoke next. He said: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>If only my misery could be weighed,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and all my ills be put together on the scales!</span><br />
<span>But they outweigh the sands of the seas:</span><br />
<span class="i1">what wonder then if my words are wild?</span><br />
<span>The arrows of Shaddai stick fast in me,</span><br />
<span class="i1">my spirit absorbs their poison,</span><br />
<span class="i1">God’s terrors stand paraded against me.</span><br />
<span>Does a wild donkey bray when it has grass,</span><br />
<span class="i1">or an ox low when its fodder is within reach?</span><br />
<span>Is not food insipid, eaten without salt,</span><br />
<span class="i1">is there any taste in egg-white?</span><br />
<span>But the very things my appetite revolts at</span><br />
<span class="i1">are now my diet in sickness.</span><br />
<span>Will no one hear my prayer,</span><br />
<span class="i1">will not God himself grant my hope?</span><br />
<span>May it please God to crush me, </span><br />
<span class="i1">to give his hand free play and do away with me!</span><br />
<span>This thought, at least, would give me comfort</span><br />
<span class="i1">(a thrill of joy in unrelenting pain),</span><br />
<span class="i1">that I never rebelled against the Holy One’s decrees.</span><br />
<span>But have I the strength to go on waiting?</span><br />
<span class="i1">And why be patient, when doomed to such an end?</span><br />
<span>Is mine the strength of stone,</span><br />
<span class="i1">is my flesh made of bronze?</span><br />
<span>Can I support myself on nothing?</span><br />
<span class="i1">Has not all help deserted me?</span><br />
<span>Refuse faithful love to your neighbour</span><br />
<span class="i1">and you forsake the fear of Shaddai.</span><br />

<h4>The unswerving course of God’s justice (8:1–22)</h4>

<span>Question the generation that has passed,</span><br />
<span class="i1">meditate on the experience of its ancestors —</span><br />
<span>for we children of yesterday, we know nothing,</span><br />
<span class="i1">our life on earth passes like a shadow —</span><br />
<span>but they will teach you, they will tell you,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and their thought is expressed in these sayings,</span><br />
<span>“Can papyrus flourish except in marshes?</span><br />
<span class="i1">Without water can the rushes grow?</span><br />
<span>Even when green and before being cut,</span><br />
<span class="i1">fastest of all plants they wither.</span><br />
<span>Such is the fate of all who forget God;</span><br />
<span class="i1">so perishes the hope of the godless.</span><br />
<span>His hope is nothing but gossamer,</span><br />
<span class="i1">his confidence a spider’s web.</span><br />
<span>Let him lean on his house, it will not stand firm;</span><br />
<span class="i1">cling to it, it will not hold.</span><br />
<span>Like some lush plant in the sunlight,</span><br />
<span class="i1">he sent his young shoots sprouting over the garden;</span><br />
<span>but his roots were twined in a heap of stones,</span><br />
<span class="i1">he drew his life among the rocks.</span><br />
<span>Snatch him from his bed,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and it denies it ever saw him.</span><br />
<span>Now he rots on the roadside,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and others are springing up in the soil.</span><br />
<span>Believe me, God neither spurns anyone of integrity,</span><br />
<span class="i1">nor lends his aid to the evil.</span><br />
<span>Once again laughter may fill your mouth</span><br />
<span class="i1">and cries of joy break from your lips.</span><br />
<span>Your enemies will be covered with shame</span><br />
<span class="i1">and the tent of the wicked will vanish!”.</span><br />

<h4>God’s justice is above all law (9:1–10:22)</h4>

<p>Job spoke next. He said: </p>

<p class="poem">
<span>Indeed, I know it is as you say:</span><br />
<span class="i1">how could anyone claim to be upright before God?</span><br />
<span>Anyone trying to argue matters with him,</span><br />
<span class="i1">could not give him one answer in a thousand.</span><br />
<span>Among the wisest and the hardiest,</span><br />
<span class="i1">who then can successfully defy him?</span><br />
<span>He moves the mountains, though they do not know it;</span><br />
<span class="i1">he throws them down when he is angry.</span><br />
<span>He shakes the earth, and moves it from its place,</span><br />
<span class="i1">making all its pillars tremble.</span><br />
<span>The sun, at his command, forbears to rise,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and on the stars he sets a seal.</span><br />
<span>He and no other has stretched out the heavens</span><br />
<span class="i1">and trampled on the back of the Sea.</span><br />
<span>He has made the Bear and Orion,</span><br />
<span class="i1">the Pleiades and the Mansions of the South.</span><br />
<span>The works he does are great and unfathomable,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and his marvels cannot be counted.</span><br />
<span>If he passes me, I do not see him;</span><br />
<span class="i1">he slips by, imperceptible to me.</span><br />
<span>If he snatches his prey, who is going to stop him</span><br />
<span class="i1">or dare to ask, “What are you doing?”?</span><br />
<span>God does not renounce his anger:</span><br />
<span class="i1">beneath him, Rahab’s minions still lie prostrate.</span><br />

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>And here am I, proposing to defend myself</span><br />
<span class="i1">and select my arguments against him!</span><br />
<span>Even if I am upright, what point is there in answering him?</span><br />
<span class="i1">I can only plead for mercy with my judge!</span><br />
<span>And if he deigned to answer my citation,</span><br />
<span class="i1">I cannot believe he would listen to what I said,</span><br />
<span>he who crushes me for one hair,</span><br />
<span class="i1">who, for no reason, wounds and wounds again,</span><br />
<span>not even letting me regain my breath,</span><br />
<span class="i1">with so much bitterness he fills me!</span><br />
<span>Shall I try force? Look how strong he is!</span><br />
<span class="i1">Or go to court? But who will summon him?</span><br />
<span>If I prove myself upright, his mouth may condemn me,</span><br />
<span class="i1">even if I am innocent, he may pronounce me perverse.</span><br />
<span>But am I innocent? I am no longer sure,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and life itself I despise!</span><br />
<span>It is all one, and hence I boldly say:</span><br />
<span class="i1">he destroys innocent and guilty alike.</span><br />
<span>When a sudden deadly scourge descends,</span><br />
<span class="i1">he laughs at the plight of the innocent.</span><br />
<span>When a country falls into the power of the wicked,</span><br />
<span class="i1">he veils the faces of its judges.</span><br />
<span class="i1">Or if not he, who else?</span><br />
<span>My days pass: more swiftly than a runner</span><br />
<span class="i1">they flee away with never a glimpse of happiness,</span><br />
<span>they skim past like a reed canoe,</span><br />
<span class="i1">like an eagle swooping on its prey.</span><br />
<span>If I decide to stifle my complaining,</span><br />
<span class="i1">change countenance, and wear a smiling face,</span><br />
<span>fear seizes me at the thought of all my woes,</span><br />
<span class="i1">for I know you do not regard me as innocent.</span><br />
<span>And if I have done wrong,</span><br />
<span class="i1">why should I put myself to useless trouble?</span><br />
<span>If I wash myself in melted snow,</span><br />
<span class="i1">clean my hands with soda,</span><br />
<span>you will only plunge me into the dung,</span><br />
<span class="i1">until my clothes themselves recoil from me!</span><br />
<span>For he is not human like me: impossible for me to answer him</span><br />
<span class="i1">or appear alongside him in court.</span><br />
<span>There is no arbiter between us,</span><br />
<span class="i1">to lay his hand on both,</span><br />
<span>to stay his rod from me,</span><br />
<span class="i1">or keep away his daunting terrors.</span><br />
<span>Nonetheless, unafraid of him, I shall speak:</span><br />
<span class="i1">since I do not see myself like that at all!</span><br />

<span>I shall say to God, “Do not condemn me,</span><br />

<span class="i1">in contempt for what you yourself have made,</span><br />

<span>Having made me, remember, as though of clay,</span><br />
<span class="i1">now you mean to turn me back into dust!</span><br />
<span>Did you not pour me out like milk,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and then let me thicken like curds,</span><br />
<span>clothe me with skin and flesh,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and weave me of bone and sinew?</span><br />
<span>In your love you gave me life,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and in your care watched over my every breath.</span><br />
<span>Yet, all the while, you had a secret plan:</span><br />
<span class="i1">I know that you were biding your time</span><br />
<span>to see if I should sin</span><br />
<span class="i1">and then not acquit me of my faults.</span><br />
<span>Woe to me, if I am guilty;</span><br />
<span class="i1">even if I am upright, I dare not lift my head,</span><br />
<span class="i1">so overwhelmed with shame and drunk with pain am I!</span><br />
<span>Proud as a lion, you hunt me down,</span><br />
<span class="i1">multiplying your exploits at my expense,</span><br />
<span>attacking me again and again,</span><br />
<span class="i1">your fury against me ever increasing,</span><br />

<span>The days of my life are few enough:</span><br />

<h4>Job must acknowledge God’s wisdom (11:1–20)</h4>

<p>Zophar of Naamath spoke next. He said: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>Is babbling to go without an answer?</span><br />
<span class="i1">Is wordiness a proof of uprightness?</span><br />
<span>Do you think your talking strikes people dumb,</span><br />
<span class="i1">will you jeer with no one to refute you?</span><br />
<span>These were your words, “My conduct is pure,</span><br />
<span class="i1">in your eyes I am free of blame!”.</span><br />
<span>Will no one let God speak,</span><br />
<span class="i1">open his lips and give you answer,</span><br />
<span>show you the secrets of wisdom</span><br />
<span class="i1">which put all cleverness to shame?</span><br />
<span class="i1">Then you would realise that God is calling you to account for your sin.</span><br />
<span>Can you claim to fathom the depth of God,</span><br />
<span class="i1">can you reach the limit of Shaddai?</span><br />
<span>It is higher than the heavens: what can you do?</span><br />
<span class="i1">It is deeper than Sheol: what can you know?</span><br />
<span>It would be longer to measure than the earth</span><br />
<span class="i1">and broader than the sea.</span><br />
<span>If he intervenes to close or convoke the assembly,</span><br />
<span class="i1">who is to prevent him?</span><br />
<span>He knows how deceptive human beings are,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and he sees their misdeeds too, and marks them well.</span><br />
<span>Hence empty-headed people would do well to study sense</span><br />
<span class="i1">and people who behave like wild donkeys to let themselves be tamed.</span><br />

<span>you will be able to raise an unsullied face,</span><br />
<span class="i1">unwavering and free from fear,</span><br />
<span>for you will forget about your misery,</span><br />

<h4>God’s wisdom is best seen in the awesome works of his omnipotence (12:1–14:22)</h4>

<p>Job spoke next. He said: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>Doubtless, you are the voice of the people,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and when you die, wisdom will die with you!</span><br />
<span>But I have a brain, as well as you,</span><br />
<span class="i1">I am in no way inferior to you,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and who, in any case, does not know all that?</span><br />
<span>Anyone becomes a laughing-stock to his friends</span><br />
<span class="i1">if he cries to God and expects an answer.</span><br />
<span class="i1">People laugh at anyone who has integrity and is upright.</span><br />
<span>“Add insult to injury”, think the prosperous,</span><br />
<span class="i1">“strike the fellow now that he is staggering!”.</span><br />
<span>And yet the tents of brigands are left in peace:</span><br />
<span class="i1">those who provoke God dwell secure</span><br />
<span class="i1">and so does anyone who makes a god of his fist!</span><br />
<span>You have only to ask the cattle, for them to instruct you,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and the birds of the sky, for them to inform you.</span><br />
<span>The creeping things of earth will give you lessons,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and the fish of the sea provide you an explanation:</span><br />
<span>there is not one such creature but will know</span><br />
<span class="i1">that the hand of God has arranged things like this!</span><br />
<span>In his hand is the soul of every living thing</span><br />
<span class="i1">and the breath of every human being!</span><br />
<span>Can the ear not distinguish the value of what is said,</span><br />
<span class="i1">just as the palate can tell one food from another?</span><br />
<span>Wisdom is found in the old,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and discretion comes with great age.</span><br />
<span>But in him there is wisdom, and power too,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and good counsel no less than discretion.</span><br />
<span>What he destroys, no one can rebuild;</span><br />
<span class="i1">whom he imprisons, no one can release.</span><br />
<span>Is there a drought? He has withheld the waters.</span><br />
<span class="i1">Do they play havoc on earth? He has let them loose.</span><br />
<span>In him is strength, in him resourcefulness,</span><br />
<span class="i1">beguiler and beguiled alike are his.</span><br />
<span>He robs a country’s counsellors of their wits,</span><br />
<span class="i1">turns judges into fools.</span><br />
<span>He undoes the belts of kings</span><br />
<span class="i1">and knots a rope around their waists.</span><br />
<span>He makes priests walk barefoot,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and overthrows the powers that are established.</span><br />
<span>He strikes the most assured of speakers dumb</span><br />
<span class="i1">and robs old people of their discretion.</span><br />
<span>He pours contempt on the nobly born,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and unbuckles the belt of the strong.</span><br />
<span>He unveils the depths of darkness,</span><br />
<span class="i1">brings shadow dark as death to the light.</span><br />
<span>He builds nations up, then ruins them,</span><br />
<span class="i1">he makes peoples expand, then suppresses them.</span><br />
<span>He strips a country’s leaders of their judgement,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and leaves them to wander in a trackless waste,</span><br />
<span>to grope about in unlit darkness,</span><br />
<span class="i1">lurching to and fro as though drunk.</span><br />

<span class="i1">humanity, which soaks up wickedness like water!</span><br />
<span>Listen to me, I have a lesson for you:</span><br />
<span class="i1">I am going to impart my own experience</span><br />
<span>and the tradition of the sages</span><br />
<span class="i1">who have remained faithful to their ancestors,</span><br />
<span>to whom alone the land was given —</span><br />
<span class="i1">no foreigner included among them.</span><br />
<span>The life of the wicked is unceasing torment,</span><br />
<span class="i1">the years allotted to the tyrant are numbered.</span><br />
<span>A cry of panic echoes in his ear;</span><br />
<span class="i1">when all is peace, his destroyer swoops down on him.</span><br />
<span>No more can he count on escaping from the dark,</span><br />
<span class="i1">but knows that he is destined for the sword,</span><br />
<span>marked down as meat for the vulture.</span><br />
<span class="i1">He knows that his ruin is at hand.</span><br />
<span>The hour of darkness terrifies him,</span><br />
<span class="i1">distress and anguish assail him</span><br />
<span class="i1">as when a king is poised for the assault.</span><br />
<span>He raised his hand against God,</span><br />
<span class="i1">boldly he defied Shaddai!</span><br />
<span>Head lowered, he charged him,</span><br />
<span class="i1">with his massively bossed shield.</span><br />
<span>His face had grown full and fat,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and his thighs too heavy with flesh.</span><br />
<span>He had occupied the towns he had destroyed,</span><br />
<span class="i1">with their uninhabited houses</span><br />
<span class="i1">about to fall into ruins;</span><br />
<span>but no great profit to him, his luck will not hold,</span><br />
<span class="i1">he will cast his shadow over the country no longer,</span><br />
<span>(he will not escape the dark).</span><br />
<span>A flame will scorch his young shoots,</span><br />
<span class="i1">the wind will carry off his blossom.</span><br />
<span class="i1">Let him not trust in his great height</span><br />
<span class="i1">or delusion will be his.</span><br />
<span>His palm trees will wither before their time</span><br />
<span class="i1">and his branches never again be green.</span><br />
<span>Like the vine, he will shake off his unripe fruit,</span><br />
<span class="i1">like the olive tree, shed his blossom.</span><br />
<span>Yes, sterile is the spawn of the sinner,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and fire consumes the tents of the venal.</span><br />
<span>Whoëver conceives malice, breeds disaster,</span><br />
<span class="i1">bears as offspring only a false hope.</span><br />

<span>the triumph of the wicked has always been brief,</span><br />

<span>And because he is up there, you have said, “What does God know?</span><br />
<span class="i1">Can he judge through the dark cloud?</span><br />
<span>The clouds, to him, are an impenetrable veil,</span><br />
<span class="i1">as he goes his way on the rim of the heavens”.</span><br />
<span>And will you still follow the ancient trail</span><br />
<span class="i1">trodden by the wicked,</span><br />
<span>those who were borne off before their time,</span><br />
<span class="i1">whose foundations were swamped by a flood,</span><br />
<span>for having said to God, “Go away!</span><br />
<span class="i1">What can Shaddai do to us?”.</span><br />
<span>Yet he himself had filled their houses with good things,</span><br />
<span class="i1">although excluded from the plans of the wicked!</span><br />
<span>At such a spectacle, the upright rejoice,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and the innocent deride them:</span><br />

<span class="i1">See how their wealth has perished in the flames!”.</span><br />

<span>This is the fate that God assigns to the wicked,</span><br />

<span class="i1">his descendants will never have enough to eat.</span><br />
<span>Plague will bury those he leaves behind him,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and their widows will have no chance to mourn them.</span><br />
<span>Though he amass silver like dust</span><br />
<span class="i1">and gather fine clothes like clay,</span><br />
<span>let him gather! — some good man will wear them,</span><br />
<span class="i1">while his silver is shared among the upright.</span><br />
<span>All he has built himself is a spider’s web,</span><br />
<span class="i1">made himself a watchman’s shack.</span><br />
<span>He goes to bed rich, but never again:</span><br />
<span class="i1">he wakes to find it has all gone.</span><br />
<span>Terror assails him in broad daylight,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and at night a whirlwind sweeps him off.</span><br />
<span>An east wind picks him up and drags him away,</span><br />
<span class="i1">snatching him up from his homestead.</span><br />
<span>Pitilessly he is turned into a target,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and forced to flee from the hands that menace him.</span><br />
<span>His downfall is greeted with applause,</span><br />
<span class="i1">he is hissed wherever he goes.</span><br />
<span>He is no more than a straw floating on the water,</span><br />
<span class="i1">his estate is accursed throughout the land,</span><br />
<span class="i1">nobody goes near his vineyard.</span><br />
<span>As drought and heat make snow disappear,</span><br />
<span class="i1">so does Sheol anyone who has sinned.</span><br />
<span>The womb that shaped him forgets him</span><br />
<span class="i1">and his name is recalled no longer.</span><br />
<span>Thus wickedness is blasted as a tree is struck.</span><br />

<span>But he who lays mighty hold on tyrants</span><br />
<span class="i1">rises up to take away a life that seemed secure.</span><br />
<span>He let him build his hopes on false security,</span><br />
<span class="i1">but kept his eyes on every step he took.</span><br />
<span>He had his time of glory, now he vanishes,</span><br />
<span class="i1">wilting like the saltwort once it is picked,</span><br />

<p>End of the words of Job. </p>

<h2 id="iii">III: The Discourses of Elihu (32:1–37:24)</h2>

<h4>Elihu joins the discussion (32:1–6a)</h4>

<p>These three men stopped arguing with Job, because he was convinced of his uprightness. But Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite, of the clan of Ram, became very angry. He fumed with rage against Job for thinking that he was right and God was wrong; and he was equally angry with the three friends for giving up the argument and thus putting God in the wrong. While they and Job were talking, Elihu had waited, because they were older than he was; but when he saw that the three men had not another word to say in answer, his anger burst out. And Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite began to speak. He said: </p>

<h4>Prologue (32:6b–22)</h4>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>I am still young,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and you are old,</span><br />
<span>so I was shy and hesitant</span><br />
<span class="i1">to tell you what I know.</span><br />
<span>I thought, “Age ought to speak,</span><br />
<span class="i1">advancing years will convey wisdom”.</span><br />
<span>There is, you see, a spirit residing in humanity,</span><br />
<span class="i1">the breath of God conferring intelligence.</span><br />
<span>Great age does not give wisdom,</span><br />
<span class="i1">nor seniority fair judgement.</span><br />
<span>And so I ask you for a hearing;</span><br />
<span class="i1">now it is my turn to tell what I know.</span><br />
<span>Up to now, I was hanging on your words,</span><br />
<span class="i1">I paid attention to your arguments</span><br />
<span class="i1">as each of you chose his words.</span><br />
<span>I paid very close attention;</span><br />
<span class="i1">and I see that none of you has confounded Job,</span><br />
<span class="i1">not one of you has refuted what he says.</span><br />
<span>So do not say, “We have found wisdom;</span><br />
<span class="i1">our teaching is divine and not human”.</span><br />
<span>I am not going to follow the same line of argument;</span><br />
<span class="i1">my reply to Job will be couched in different terms.</span><br />

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>They are nonplussed for an answer,</span><br />
<span class="i1">words have failed them.</span><br />
<span>I have been waiting. Since they do not speak,</span><br />
<span class="i1">since they have given up the argument,</span><br />
<span>now I shall have my say,</span><br />
<span class="i1">my turn has come to say what I know.</span><br />
<span>For I am full of words</span><br />
<span class="i1">and forced to speak by a spirit within me;</span><br />
<span>within me, it feels like new wine seeking a vent,</span><br />
<span class="i1">bursting out of new wine-skins.</span><br />
<span>To gain relief, I must speak,</span><br />
<span class="i1">I must open my lips and reply.</span><br />
<span>I shall not take anyone’s side,</span><br />
<span class="i1">I shall not flatter anyone.</span><br />
<span>I do not know how to flatter —</span><br />

<h4>Job’s presumption (33:1–33)</h4>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>So, Job, please listen to my words</span><br />
<span class="i1">and attend to all I have to say.</span><br />
<span>Now as I open my mouth,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and my tongue shapes words against my palate,</span><br />
<span>I shall utter words of wisdom from the heart,</span><br />
<span class="i1">my lips will speak in all sincerity.</span><br />
<span>Refute me, if you can. </span><br />
<span class="i1">Prepare yourself, take up your position!</span><br />
<span>Look, I am your equal, not some god,</span><br />
<span class="i1">like you I was moulded out of clay.</span><br />
<span>God’s was the spirit that made me,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Shaddai’s the breath that gave me life.</span><br />
<span>No fear of me, therefore, need affright you,</span><br />
<span class="i1">my hand will not lie heavy over you.</span><br />
<span>How could you say in my hearing —</span><br />
<span class="i1">for the sound of your words did not escape me —</span><br />
<span>“I am clean, and sinless,</span><br />
<span class="i1">I am pure, without fault.</span><br />
<span>But he keeps inventing excuses against me</span><br />
<span class="i1">and regards me as his enemy.</span><br />
<span>He puts me in the stocks,</span><br />
<span class="i1">he watches my every path”?</span><br />
<span>In saying so, I tell you, you are wrong:</span><br />
<span class="i1">for God is greater than any human being.</span><br />
<span>Why then quarrel with him</span><br />
<span class="i1">for not replying to you, word for word?</span><br />
<span>God speaks first in one way,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and then in another, although we do not realise it.</span><br />
<span>In dreams and in night-visions,</span><br />
<span class="i1">when slumber has settled on humanity</span><br />
<span class="i1">and people are asleep in bed,</span><br />
<span>he speaks in someone’s ear,</span><br />
<span class="i1">frightens him with apparitions</span><br />
<span>turn him from what he is doing</span><br />
<span class="i1">and to put an end to his pride.</span><br />
<span>And thus he preserves his soul from the abyss,</span><br />
<span class="i1">his life from passing down the Canal.</span><br />
<span>Or again, he corrects by the sufferings of the sick-bed,</span><br />
<span class="i1">when someone’s bones tremble continuously</span><br />
<span>and the thought of food revolts him,</span><br />
<span class="i1">however tasty it is,</span><br />
<span>and his flesh rots away while you watch it</span><br />
<span class="i1">and the bones beneath begin to show,</span><br />
<span>and his soul is drawing nearer to the abyss</span><br />
<span class="i1">and his life to the dwelling of the dead.</span><br />
<span>Then, if there is an Angel near him,</span><br />
<span class="i1">a Mediator, one in a thousand,</span><br />
<span>to remind him where his duty lies,</span><br />
<span class="i1">to take pity on him and to say,</span><br />
<span class="i1">“Spare him from going down to the abyss:</span><br />
<span class="i1">I have found the ransom for his life”,</span><br />
<span>his flesh will recover its childhood freshness,</span><br />
<span class="i1">he will return to the days of his youth.</span><br />
<span>He will pray to God who has restored him to favour,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and will come into his presence with joy.</span><br />
<span>He will tell others how he has received saving justice</span><br />
<span class="i1">and sing this hymn before his companions,</span><br />
<span>“I sinned and left the path of right,</span><br />
<span class="i1">but God has not punished me as my sin deserved.</span><br />
<span>He has spared my soul from going down to the abyss</span><br />
<span class="i1">and is making my life see the light”.</span><br />
<span>All this is what God keeps doing</span><br />
<span class="i1">again and yet again for human beings,</span><br />
<span>to snatch souls back from the abyss</span><br />
<span class="i1">and to make the light of the living still shine.</span><br />

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>Pay attention, Job, listen to me:</span><br />
<span class="i1">keep quiet, I have more to say.</span><br />
<span>If you have anything to say, refute me,</span><br />
<span class="i1">speak out, for I would gladly accept that you are upright.</span><br />
<span>If not, then listen to me:</span><br />

<h4>The three sages have failed to justify God (34:1–37)</h4>

<p>Elihu continued his speech. He said: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>And now, you sages, listen to what I say,</span><br />
<span class="i1">lend me your ears, you learned men.</span><br />
<span>The ear distinguishes the value of what is said,</span><br />
<span class="i1">just as the palate can tell one food from another.</span><br />
<span>Let us consider together God’s ruling</span><br />
<span class="i1">and decide what we all mean by good.</span><br />
<span>Job has been saying, “I am upright</span><br />
<span class="i1">and God denies me fair judgement.</span><br />
<span>My judge is treating me cruelly,</span><br />
<span class="i1">my wound is incurable, for no fault of mine”.</span><br />
<span>Can anyone else exist like Job,</span><br />
<span class="i1">who laps up mockery like water,</span><br />
<span>who consorts with evil-doers</span><br />
<span class="i1">and marches in step with the wicked?</span><br />
<span>Did he not say, “No one derives any benefit</span><br />
<span class="i1">from enjoying the society of God”?</span><br />

<span>Listen to me then, like intelligent people.</span><br />

<span class="i1">treating each as his own conduct deserves.</span><br />
<span>Be sure of it: God never does wrong,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Shaddai does not pervert what is just.</span><br />
<span>Did someone else entrust the world to his care</span><br />
<span class="i1">was he given charge of the universe by someone else?</span><br />
<span>If he were to recall his spirit,</span><br />
<span class="i1">to concentrate his breath back in himself,</span><br />
<span>all flesh would instantly perish</span><br />
<span class="i1">and all people would return to dust.</span><br />
<span>If you have any intelligence, listen to this,</span><br />
<span class="i1">lend your ear to the sound of my words.</span><br />
<span>Could an enemy of fair judgement ever govern?</span><br />
<span class="i1">Would you dare condemn the Upright One, the Almighty,</span><br />
<span>who says to a king, “You are a scoundrel!”,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and to nobles, “You are wicked!”,</span><br />
<span>who is unimpressed by princes</span><br />
<span class="i1">and makes no distinction between rich and poor,</span><br />
<span class="i1">since all alike have been made by him?</span><br />
<span>They die suddenly, at dead of night,</span><br />
<span class="i1">they perish — these great ones — and disappear:</span><br />
<span class="i1">it costs him no effort to remove a tyrant.</span><br />
<span>For his eyes keep watch on human ways,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and he observes every step.</span><br />
<span>No darkness, no shadow dark as death</span><br />
<span class="i1">where wrong-doers can hide!</span><br />
<span>He serves no writ on anyone,</span><br />
<span class="i1">no summons to appear before God’s court:</span><br />
<span>he breaks the powerful without enquiry</span><br />
<span class="i1">and sets up others in their places.</span><br />
<span>He knows the sort of things they do!</span><br />
<span class="i1">He overthrows them at night, to be trampled on.</span><br />
<span>He beats them like criminals</span><br />
<span class="i1">chained up for all to see,</span><br />
<span>since they have turned their backs on him,</span><br />
<span class="i1">having understood so little of his ways</span><br />

<h4>God’s transcendence (35:1–16)</h4>

<p>Elihu continued his speech. He said: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>Do you think you can prove yourself upright</span><br />
<span class="i1">and establish your uprightness before God</span><br />
<span>by daring to say to him, “What does it matter to you,</span><br />
<span class="i1">or how does it benefit me, whether I have sinned or not?”.</span><br />
<span>Very well, I shall tell you</span><br />
<span class="i1">and your friends as well.</span><br />

<p class="poem">
<span>Take a look at the skies and see,</span><br />
<span class="i1">observe how high the clouds are above you.</span><br />
<span>If you sin, how can you affect him?</span><br />
<span class="i1">If you heap up crimes, what effect has it on him?</span><br />
<span>If you are upright, what do you give him,</span><br />
<span class="i1">what benefit does he receive at your hands?</span><br />
<span>Your wickedness affects only your fellows,</span><br />
<span class="i1">your uprightness, other human beings.</span><br />
<span>They too groan under the weight of oppression,</span><br />
<span class="i1">they cry for help under the tyranny of the mighty,</span><br />
<span>but none of them thinks of saying, “Where is God, my Maker,</span><br />
<span class="i1">who makes glad songs ring out at night,</span><br />
<span>who has made us more intelligent than wild animals</span><br />
<span class="i1">wiser than birds in the sky?”.</span><br />
<span>Cry they may, but get no answer,</span><br />
<span class="i1">to be spared from the arrogance of the wicked.</span><br />
<span>Of course God does not listen to trivialities,</span><br />
<span class="i1">Shaddai pays no attention to them.</span><br />
<span>And how much less when you say, “I cannot see him,</span><br />
<span class="i1">my case is open and I am waiting for him”.</span><br />
<span>Or, “His anger never punishes,</span><br />
<span class="i1">he does not seem aware of human rebellion”.</span><br />
<span>Hence, when Job speaks, he talks nonsense,</span><br />
<span class="i1">ignorantly babbling on and on.</span><br />

<h4>The real meaning of Job’s sufferings (36:1–21)</h4>

<p>Elihu went on speaking. He said: </p>

<span>I guarantee, nothing I shall say will be untrue:</span><br />
<span class="i1">you have a man of sound learning here.</span><br />
<span>God does not reject anyone whose heart is pure</span><br />
<span class="i1">or let the sinner live on in all his power.</span><br />
<span>He does accord fair judgement to the afflicted;</span><br />
<span class="i1">he does uphold what the upright deserve.</span><br />
<span>When he raises kings to thrones,</span><br />
<span class="i1">if they grow proud of their unending rule,</span><br />
<span>then he fetters them with chains,</span><br />
<span class="i1">they are caught in the bonds of affliction.</span><br />
<span>He shows them the import of their deeds,</span><br />
<span class="i1">of the sins of pride they have committed.</span><br />
<span>In their ears he sounds a warning,</span><br />
<span class="i1">ordering them to turn back from doing wrong.</span><br />
<span>If they take notice and obey him,</span><br />
<span class="i1">the rest of their days are prosperous</span><br />
<span class="i1">and the years pass pleasantly.</span><br />
<span>If not, they go down the Canal</span><br />

<span>The stubborn, who cherish their anger</span><br />
<span class="i1">and do not cry for help when he chains them,</span><br />
<span>die in the bloom of youth</span><br />
<span class="i1">or live among the male prostitutes of the temple.</span><br />
<span>But God saves the afflicted by his affliction,</span><br />
<span class="i1">warning him in his misery.</span><br />
<span>You, too, he would like to snatch from torment.</span><br />
<span>While you were enjoying boundless abundance,</span><br />
<span class="i1">with rich food piled high on your table,</span><br />
<span>you did not bring the wicked to trial</span><br />
<span class="i1">and did not give fair judgement to the orphan.</span><br />
<span>Beware of being led astray by abundance,</span><br />
<span class="i1">of being corrupted by expensive presents.</span><br />
<span>Take the powerful to law, not merely the penniless,</span><br />
<span class="i1">those whose arm is strong, not merely the weak.</span><br />
<span>Do not crush people you do not know</span><br />
<span class="i1">to install your relations in their place.</span><br />
<span>Avoid any tendency to wrong-doing,</span><br />
<span class="i1">for this is why affliction is testing you now.</span><br />

<h4>Hymn to God’s omnipotence (36:22–37:24)</h4>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>See, God is sublime in his strength</span><br />
<span class="i1">and who can teach lessons as he does?</span><br />
<span>Who has even told him which course to take,</span><br />
<span class="i1">or dared to say to him, “You have done wrong”?</span><br />
<span>Consider, rather, how you may praise his work,</span><br />
<span class="i1">a theme that many have sung.</span><br />
<span>This is something that everyone can see,</span><br />
<span class="i1">gazing, as we do, from afar.</span><br />
<span>Yes, the greatness of God exceeds our knowledge,</span><br />
<span class="i1">the number of his years is past counting.</span><br />
<span>It is he who makes the raindrops small</span><br />
<span class="i1">and pulverises the rain into mist.</span><br />
<span>And the clouds then pour this out,</span><br />
<span class="i1">sending it streaming down on the human race.</span><br />
<span>By these means, he sustains the peoples,</span><br />
<span class="i1">giving them plenty to eat.</span><br />
<span>And who can fathom how he spreads the clouds,</span><br />
<span class="i1">or why such crashes thunder from his tent?</span><br />
<span>He spreads a mist before him</span><br />
<span class="i1">and covers the tops of the mountains.</span><br />
<span>He gathers up the lightning in his hands,</span><br />
<span class="i1">assigning it the mark where to strike.</span><br />
<span>His crashing gives warning of its coming,</span><br />
<span class="i1">anger flashes out against iniquity.</span><br />
<span>At this, my very heart quakes</span><br />
<span class="i1">and leaps out of its place.</span><br />
<span>Listen, oh listen, to the blast of his voice</span><br />
<span class="i1">and the sound that issues from his mouth.</span><br />
<span>His lightning is hurled across the heaven,</span><br />
<span class="i1">it strikes to the extremities of earth.</span><br />
<span>After it comes a roaring sound,</span><br />
<span class="i1">God thunders with majestic voice.</span><br />
<span>He does not check his thunderbolts</span><br />
<span class="i1">until his voice resounds no more.</span><br />
<span>Yes, certainly God shows us marvels</span><br />
<span class="i1">and does great deeds that we cannot understand.</span><br />
<span>When he says to the snow, “Fall on the earth!”,</span><br />
<span class="i1">to the showers, “Now rain hard!”.</span><br />
<span>he brings all human activity to a standstill,</span><br />
<span class="i1">for everyone to acknowledge his work.</span><br />
<span>The animals go back to their dens</span><br />
<span class="i1">and take shelter in their lairs.</span><br />
<span>The storm wind comes from the Mansion of the South,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and the north winds usher in the cold.</span><br />
<span>At the breath of God, ice comes next,</span><br />
<span class="i1">the surface of the waters hardens over.</span><br />
<span>He weighs the clouds down with moisture,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and the storm clouds radiate his lightning.</span><br />
<span>He himself guides their wheeling motion</span><br />
<span class="i1">presiding over their seasonal changes.</span><br />
<span>They carry out his orders to the letter</span><br />
<span class="i1">all over this earthly world.</span><br />
<span>Whether to punish earth’s peoples</span><br />
<span class="i1">or as a work of faithful love, he despatches them.</span><br />
<span>Listen to this, Job, without flinching</span><br />
<span class="i1">and reflect on the marvellous works of God.</span><br />
<span>Do you know how God controls them</span><br />
<span class="i1">or how his clouds make the lightning flash?</span><br />
<span>Do you know how he balances the clouds —</span><br />
<span class="i1">a miracle of consummate skill?</span><br />
<span>When your clothes are hot to your body</span><br />
<span class="i1">and the earth lies still under the south wind,</span><br />
<span>can you, like him, stretch out the sky,</span><br />
<span class="i1">tempered like a mirror of cast metal?</span><br />
<span>Teach me what we should say to him:</span><br />
<span class="i1">but better discuss no further, since we are in the dark.</span><br />
<span>Does he take note when I speak?</span><br />
<span class="i1">When human beings give orders, does he take it in?</span><br />
<span>There are times when the light vanishes,</span><br />
<span class="i1">behind darkening clouds;</span><br />
<span>then comes the wind, sweeping them away.</span><br />
<span class="i1">and brightness spreads from the north.</span><br />
<span>God is clothed in fearful splendour:</span><br />
<span class="i1">he, Shaddai, is far beyond our reach.</span><br />
<span>Supreme in power, in equity,</span><br />
<span class="i1">excelling in saving justice, yet no oppressor —</span><br />
<span>no wonder then that people fear him:</span><br />
<span class="i1">everyone thoughtful holds him in awe!</span><br />

<span class="i1">unyielding as the lower millstone.</span><br />
<span>Sword may strike but will not stick in him,</span><br />
<span>no more will spear, javelin or lance.</span><br />
<span>Iron means no more to him than straw,</span><br />

<span>He has no equal on earth,</span><br />

<h4>Job’s final answer (42:1–6)</h4>

<p>This was the answer Job gave to Yahweh: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>I know that you are all-powerful:</span><br />
<span class="i1">what you conceive, you can perform.</span><br />

<span>I retract what I have said,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and repent in dust and ashes.</span><br />

</blockquote>

<h2 id="v">Epilogue (42:7–17)</h2>

<h4>Yahweh rebukes the three sages (42:7–9)</h4>

<p>When Yahweh had finished saying this to Job, he said to Eliphaz of Teman, “I burn with anger against you and your two friends, for not having spoken correctly about me as my servant Job has done. So now find seven bullocks and seven rams, and take them back with you to my servant Job and make a burnt offering for yourselves, while Job, my servant, offers prayers for you. I shall show him favour and shall not inflict my displeasure on you for not having spoken about me correctly, as my servant Job has done”. Eliphaz of Teman, Bildad of Shuah and Zophar of Naamath went away to do as Yahweh had ordered, and Yahweh listened to Job with favour. </p>

<h4>Yahweh restores Job’s fortunes (42:10–17)</h4>

<p>And Yahweh restored Job’s condition, while Job was interceding for his friends. More than that, Yahweh gave him double what he had before. And all his brothers and all his sisters and all his friends of former times came to see him. Over dinner in his house, they showed their sympathy and comforted him for all the evils Yahweh had inflicted on him. Each of them gave him a silver coin, and each a gold ring. Yahweh blessed Job’s latter condition even more than his former one. He came to own fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand she-donkeys. He had seven sons and three daughters; his first daughter he called “Turtledove”, the second “Cassia”, and the third “Mascara”. Throughout the land there were no women as beautiful as the daughters of Job. And their father gave them inheritance rights like their brothers. </p>

<p>After this, Job lived for another one hundred and forty years, and saw his children and his children’s children to the fourth generation. Then, old and full of days, Job died. </p>
