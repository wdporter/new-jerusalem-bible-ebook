<h4>Two epigrams</h4>

<p>Our sister is little: her breasts are not yet formed. What shall we do for our sister on the day she is spoken for? If she is a rampart, on the crest we shall build a battlement of silver; if she is a door, we shall board her up with planks of cedar.</p>

<p>I am a wall, and my breasts represent its towers. And under their eyes I have found true peace.</p>

<p>Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-Hamon. He entrusted it to overseers, and each one was to pay him the value of its produce, a thousand shekels of silver. But I tend my own vineyard myself. You, Solomon, may have your thousand shekels, and those who oversee its produce their two hundred.</p>

<h4>Final additions</h4>

<p>You who dwell in the gardens, my companions listen for your voice; let me hear it.</p>

<blockquote>Haste away, my love, <br />
be like a gazelle, <br />
a young stag, <br />
on the spice-laden mountains.</blockquote>
