	<li><a href="#i">The Census (1:1–4:49)</a></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="i">The Census (1:1–4:49)</h2>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses, in the desert of Sinai, in the Tent of Meeting, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after the exodus from Egypt, and said: </p>

<p>“Take a census of the whole community of Israelites by clans and families, taking a count of the names of all the males, head by head. You and Aaron will register all those in Israel, twenty years of age and over, fit to bear arms, company by company; you will have one man from each tribe, the head of his family, to help you.</p>

<h4>The census officials (1:5–19)</h4>

<p>“These are the names of those who must help you: </p>

<p>“For Reuben, Elizur son of Shedeur. </p>

<p>“For Simeon, Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai. </p>

<p>“For Judah, Nahshon son of Amminadab. </p>

<p>“For Issachar, Nethanel son of Zuar. </p>

<p>“For Zebulun, Eliab son of Helon. </p>

<p>“Of the sons of Joseph: for Ephraim, Elishama son of Ammihud; for Manasseh, Gamaliel son of Pedahzur. </p>

<p>“For Benjamin, Abidan son of Gideoni. </p>

<p>“For Dan, Ahiezerson of Ammishaddai. </p>

<p>“For Asher, Pagiel son of Ochran. </p>

<p>“For Gad, Eliasaph son of Reuel. </p>

<p>“For Naphtali, Ahira son of Enan”. </p>

<p>These were men of repute in the community; they were the leaders of their ancestral tribes, the heads of Israel’s thousands. </p>

<p>Moses and Aaron took these men who had been named and on the first day of the second month they mustered the whole community. The Israelites established their pedigrees by clans and families, and one by one the names of all men of twenty years and over were recorded. As Yahweh had ordered, Moses registered them in the desert of Sinai. </p>

<h4>The census (1:20–47)</h4>

<p>Once the pedigrees of the descendants of Reuben, Israel’s first-born, had been established by clans and families, the names of all the males of twenty years and over, fit to bear arms, were recorded one by one. The total of these for the tribe of Reuben was forty-six thousand five hundred. </p>

<p>Once the pedigrees of Simeon’s descendants had been established by clans and families, the names of all the males of twenty years and over, fit to bear arms, were recorded one by one. The total of these for the tribe of Simeon was fifty-nine thousand three hundred. </p>

<p>Once the pedigrees of Gad’s descendants had been established by clans and families, the names of all the males of twenty years and over, fit to bear arms, were recorded one by one. The total of these for the tribe of Gad was forty-five thousand six hundred and fifty. </p>

<p>Once the pedigrees of Judah’s descendants had been established by clans and families, the names of all the males of twenty years and over, fit to bear arms, were recorded one by one. The total of these for the tribe of Judah was seventy-four thousand six hundred. </p>

<p>Once the pedigrees of Issachar’s descendants had been established by clans and families, the names of all the males of twenty years and over, fit to bear arms, were recorded one by one. The total of these for the tribe of Issachar was fifty-four thousand four hundred. </p>

<p>Once the pedigrees of Zebulun’s descendants had been established by clans and families, the names of all the males of twenty years and over, fit to bear arms, were recorded one by one. The total of these for the tribe of Zebulun was fifty-seven thousand four hundred. </p>

<p>As regards the descendants of Joseph: once the pedigrees of Ephraim’s descendants had been established by clans and families, the names of all the males of twenty years and over, fit to bear arms, were recorded one by one. The total of these for the tribe of Ephraim was forty thousand five hundred. </p>

<p>Once the pedigrees of Manasseh’s descendants had been established by clans and families, the names of all the males of twenty years and over, fit to bear arms, were recorded one by one. The total of these for the tribe of Manasseh was thirty-two thousand two hundred. </p>

<p>Once the pedigrees of Benjamin’s descendants had been established by clans and families, the names of all the males of twenty years and over, fit to bear arms, were recorded one by one. The total of these for the tribe of Benjamin was thirty-five thousand four hundred. </p>

<p>Once the pedigrees of Dan’s descendants had been established by clans and families, the names of all the males of twenty years and over, fit to bear arms, were recorded one by one. The total of these for the tribe of Dan was sixty-two thousand seven hundred. </p>

<p>Once the pedigrees of Asher’s descendants had been established by clans and families, the names of all the males of twenty years and over, fit to bear arms, were recorded one by one. The total of these for the tribe of Asher was forty-one thousand five hundred. </p>

<p>Once the pedigrees of Naphtali’s descendants had been established by clans and families, the names of all the males of twenty years and over, fit to bear arms, were recorded one by one. The total of these for the tribe of Naphtali was fifty-three thousand four hundred. </p>

<p>Such were the men registered by Moses, Aaron and the leaders of Israel, of whom there were twelve, each representing his family. All the Israelites of twenty years and over, fit to bear arms, were counted by families. Altogether, the total came to six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty. </p>

<p>But the Levites and their tribes were not included in the count. </p>

<h4>Statute for the Levites (1:48–54)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Do not, however, take a census of the Levites, or register them with the other Israelites, but enrol the Levites to take charge of the Dwelling where the Testimony is and of all its furnishings and belongings. They must carry the Dwelling and all its furnishings; they must look after the Dwelling and pitch their camp round it. Whenever the Dwelling is moved, the Levites will dismantle it; whenever the Dwelling stops for the night, the Levites will erect it. Any unauthorised person coming near it will be put to death. The Israelites will pitch their tents, each in their own encampment and by their own standard, company by company, but the Levites will pitch their tents round the Dwelling where the Testimony is. In this way Retribution will be kept from falling on the whole community of Israelites, and the Levites will keep charge of the Dwelling of the Testimony”. </p>

<p>The Israelites did exactly as Yahweh had ordered Moses. They did as he said. </p>

<h4>Order of the tribes (2:1–34)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron and said: </p>

<p>“The Israelites must pitch their tents, each man by his own standard, under their family emblems. They must pitch their tents round the Dwelling where the Testimony is, some distance away. </p>

<p>“Encamped on the east side: </p>

<p>“Furthest towards the east, the standard of the camp of Judah, unit by 
unit. Leader of the Judahites: Nahshon son of Amminadab. His company: seventy-four thousand six hundred men. </p>

<p>“Next to him: </p>

<p>“The tribe of Issachar. Leader of the Issacharites: Nethanel son of Zuar. His company: fifty-four thousand four hundred men. </p>

<p>“The tribe of Zebulun. Leader of the Zebulunites: Eliab son of Helon. His company: fifty-seven thousand four hundred men. </p>

<p>“The tribal forces in the camp of Judah number in all a hundred and eighty-six thousand four hundred. These will be the first to break camp. </p>

<p>“On the south side, the standard of the camp of Reuben, unit by unit. Leader of the Reubenites: Elizur son of Shedeur. His company: forty-six thousand five hundred men. </p>

<p>“Next to him: </p>

<p>“The tribe of Simeon. Leader of the Simeonites: Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai. His company: fifty-nine thousand three hundred men. </p>

<p>“The tribe of Gad. Leader of the Gadites: Eliasaph son of Reuel. His company: forty-five thousand six hundred and fifty men. </p>

<p>“The tribal forces in the camp of Reuben number in all a hundred and fifty-one thousand four hundred and fifty. They will be second to break camp. </p>

<p>“Next, the Tent of Meeting will move, since the camp of the Levites is situated in the middle of the other camps. The order of movement will be the order of encampment, each man under his own standard. </p>

<p>“On the west side, the standard of the camp of Ephraim, unit by unit. Leader of the Ephraimites: Elishama son of Ammihud. His company: forty thousand five hundred men. </p>

<p>“Next to him: </p>

<p>“The tribe of Manasseh. Leader of the Manassehites: Gamaliel son of Pedahzur. His company: thirty-two thousand two hundred men. </p>

<p>“The tribe of Benjamin. Leader of the Benjaminites: Abidan son of Gideoni. His company: thirty-five thousand four hundred men. </p>

<p>“The tribal forces in the camp of Ephraim number in all a hundred and eight thousand one hundred. They will be third to break camp. </p>

<p>“On the north side, the standard of the camp of Dan, unit by unit. Leader of the Danites: Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai. His company: sixty-two thousand seven hundred men. </p>

<p>“Next to him: </p>

<p>“The tribe of Asher. Leader of the Asherites: Pagiel son of Ochran. His company: forty-one thousand five hundred men. </p>

<p>“The tribe of Naphtali. Leader of the Naphtalites: Ahira son of Enan. His company: fifty-three thousand four hundred men. </p>

<p>“The tribal forces in the camp of Dan number in all a hundred and fifty-seven thousand six hundred. They will be the last to break camp. </p>

<p>“All under their appropriate standards”. </p>

<p>Such was the tally of the Israelites when the census was taken by families. The full count of the entire camp, unit by unit, came to six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty. But, as Yahweh had ordered Moses, the Levites were not included in the census of the Israelites. </p>

<p>The Israelites did exactly as Yahweh had ordered Moses. This was how they pitched camp, grouped by standards. This was how they broke camp, each man in his own clan, each man with his own family. </p>

<h4>The tribe of Levi (3:1–51)</h4> 

<h5>a: The priests (3:1–4)</h5>

<p>These were the descendants of Aaron and Moses, at the time when Yahweh spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai. </p>

<p>These were the names of Aaron’s sons: Nadab the eldest, then Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. </p>

<p>Such were the names of Aaron’s sons, priests anointed and invested with the powers of the priesthood. Nadab and Abihu died in Yahweh’s presence, in the desert of Sinai, when they offered unauthorised fire before Yahweh. They left no children and so it fell to Eleazar and Ithamar to exercise the priesthood under their father Aaron. </p>

<h5>b: The Levites: their duties (3:5–10)</h5>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Muster the tribe of Levi and put it at the disposal of the priest Aaron: they must be at his service. They will undertake the duties incumbent on him and the whole community before the Tent of Meeting, in serving the Dwelling, and they will be in charge of all the furnishings of the Tent of Meeting and undertake the duties incumbent on the Israelites in serving the Dwelling. You will present the Levites to Aaron and his sons as men dedicated; they will be given to him by the Israelites. </p>

<p>“You will register Aaron and his sons, who will carry out their priestly duty. But any unauthorised person who comes near must be put to death”. </p>

<h5>c: Their privileged status (3:11–13)</h5>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Look, I myself have chosen the Levites from the Israelites instead of all the first-born, those who emerge first from the womb in Israel; the Levites therefore belong to me. For every first-born belongs to me. On the day when I struck down all the first-born in Egypt, I consecrated all the first-born in Israel, human and animal, to be my own. They are mine, Yahweh’s”. </p>

<h5>d: Census of the Levites (3:14–39)</h5>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai and said: </p>

<p>“You must take a census of Levi’s descendants by families and clans; all the males of the age of one month and over will be counted”. </p>

<p>At Yahweh’s word Moses took a census of them, as Yahweh had ordered. These were the names of Levi’s sons: Gershon, Kohath and Merari. </p>

<p>These were the names of Gershon’s sons by their clans: Libni and Shimei; Kohath’s sons by their clans: Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel; Merari’s sons by their clans: Mahli and Mushi. These were the clans of Levi, grouped by families. </p>

<p>From Gershon were descended the Libnite and Shimeite clans; these were the Gershonite clans. Their full number, counting the males of one month and over, came to seven thousand five hundred. The Gershonite clans pitched their camp behind the Dwelling, on the west side. The leader of the House of Gershon was Eliasaph son of Lael. As regards the Tent of Meeting, the Gershonites had charge of the Dwelling, the Tent and its covering, the screen for the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the curtaining of the court, the screen for the entrance to the court surrounding the Dwelling and the altar, and the cords required in dealing with all this. </p>

<p>From Kohath were descended the Amramite, Izharite, Hebronite and Uzzielite clans; these were the Kohathite clans. Their full number, counting the males of one month and over, came to eight thousand three hundred. They were in charge of the sanctuary. The Kohathite clans pitched their camp on the south side of the Dwelling. The leader of the house of the Kohathite clans was Elizaphan son of Uzziel. They were in charge of the ark, the table, the lamp-stand, the altars, the sacred vessels used in the liturgy, and the curtain with all its fittings. </p>

<p>The chief of the Levite leaders was Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest. He supervised the people responsible for the sanctuary. </p>

<p>From Merari were descended the Mahlite and Mushite clans; these were the Merarite clans. Their full number, counting the males of one month and over, came to six thousand two hundred. The leader of the House of the Merarite clans was Zuriel, son of Abihail. They pitched their camp on the north side of the Dwelling. The Merarites were in charge of the framework of the Dwelling, with its crossbars, poles, sockets and all its accessories and fittings, and also the poles round the court, with their sockets, pegs and cords. </p>

<p>Finally, on the east side, in front of the Dwelling, in front of the Tent of Meeting, towards the east, was the camp of Moses and Aaron and his sons, who had charge of the sanctuary on behalf of the Israelites. Any unauthorised person coming near was to be put to death. </p>

<p>The total number of male Levites of the age of one month and over, whom Moses counted by clans as Yahweh had ordered, came to twenty-two thousand. </p>

<h5>e: The Levites and the ransoming of the first-born (3:40–51)</h5>

<p>Yahweh said to Moses: </p>

<p>Take a census of all the first-born of the Israelites, all the males from the age of one month and over; take a census of them by name. You will then present the Levites to me, Yahweh, instead of Israel, and similarly the Levites’ cattle instead of the first-born cattle of the Israelites”. </p>

<p>As Yahweh ordered, Moses took a census of all the first-born of the Israelites. The total count, by name, of the first-born from the age of one month and over came to twenty-two thousand two hundred and seventy-three. </p>

<p>Yahweh then spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Take the Levites instead of all the first-born of the Israelites, and the Levites’ cattle instead of their cattle; the Levites will be mine, Yahweh’s. For the ransom of the two hundred and seventy-three first-born of the Israelites in excess of the number of Levites, you will take five shekels for each, by the sanctuary shekel, at twenty <i>gerah</i> to the shekel; you will then give this money to Aaron and his sons as the ransom for the extra number”. </p>

<p>Moses took the ransom money for the extra ones unransomed by the Levites; he took the money for the first-born of the Israelites: one thousand three hundred and sixty-five shekels, by the sanctuary shekel; and Moses then handed over their ransom money to Aaron and his sons, at Yahweh’s bidding, as 
Yahweh had ordered Moses. </p>

<h4>The Levite clans (4:1–33)</h4>

<h5>a: The Kohathites (4:1–20)</h5>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Take a census by clans and families of the Levites descended from Kohath: all the men between thirty and fifty years of age and eligible for military service, who will have their duties in the Tent of Meeting. </p>

<p>“These are the duties of the Kohathites: looking after those things that are especially holy. </p>

<p>“When camp is broken, Aaron and his sons must come and take down the screening curtain, and cover the ark of the Testimony with it. Over this, they will put a covering of fine leather, over which they will spread a cloth entirely of violet-purple. They will then fix the poles to the ark. </p>

<p>“Over the offertory table they will spread a violet cloth, and on it put the dishes, cups, bowls and libation jars; the bread of permanent offering will also be on it. Over these they will spread a scarlet cloth and cover the whole with a covering of fine leather. They will then fix the poles to the table. </p>

<p>“They will then take a violet cloth and cover the lamp-stand, its lamps, snuffers, trays and all the oil jars used for it, and will lay it and all its accessories in a covering of fine leather and put it on the litter. </p>

<p>“Over the golden altar they will spread a violet cloth, and cover that with a covering of fine leather. They will then fix the poles to it. </p>

<p>“They will then take all the other objects used in the service of the sanctuary, put them in a violet cloth, with a covering of fine leather, and put it all on the litter. </p>

<p>Num 4:13 “When they have removed the ashes from the altar, they will spread a scarlet cloth over it, and on this place all the objects used in the liturgy, the fire pans, hooks, scoops, sprinkling basins and all the altar accessories. Over this they will spread a covering of fine leather. They will then fix the poles to it. </p>

<p>“Once Aaron and his sons have finished covering the holy things and all their accessories at the breaking of camp, the Kohathites will come and carry them, but without touching any of the holy things on pain of death. Such is the load for the Kohathites in the Tent of Meeting. But Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, is responsible for looking after the oil for the light, the fragrant incense, the daily cereal offering and the anointing oil, and for supervising the entire Dwelling and everything in it, the holy things and their accessories”. </p>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“You must not let the group of Kohathite clans be lost to the rest of the Levites. But deal with them in this way, so that they may survive and not incur death by approaching those things that are especially holy. Aaron and his sons will go in and assign to each of them his task and load, in such a way that they have no need to incur the death penalty by going in and setting eyes on the holy things, even for an instant”. </p>

<h5>b: The Gershonites (4:21–28)</h5>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Take a census of the Gershonites by families and clans, too: all the men between thirty and fifty years of age, eligible for military service, who will have their duties in the Tent of Meeting. </p>

<p>“These are the duties of the Gershonite clans, their functions and their loads. They will carry the curtaining of the Dwelling, the Tent of Meeting with its covering and the covering of fine leather that goes over it, the screen for the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the curtaining of the court, the screen for the entrance to the court surrounding the Dwelling and the altar, the cords, all the accessories for worship, and all the necessary equipment. </p>

<p>“They will be responsible for these things. All the duties of the Gershonites, their functions and their loads, will be carried out under the direction of Aaron and his sons: you will see that they fulfil their charge. Such are the duties of the Gershonite clans in the Tent of Meeting. Their work will be supervised by Ithamar, son of Aaron the priest. </p>

<h5>c: The Merarites (4:30–33)</h5>

<p>“You will take a census of the Merarites by clans and families. You will take a census of all the men between thirty and fifty years of age, eligible for military service, who will have their duties in the Tent of Meeting. </p>

<p>“The load they carry and the duties incumbent on them in the Tent of Meeting will be as follows: the framework of the Dwelling, its cross-bars, poles and sockets, the poles round the court with their sockets, pegs, cords and all their tackle. You will draw up a list of their names with the loads for which each is responsible. </p>

<p>“Such are the duties of the Merarite clans. All their duties in the Tent of Meeting will be supervised by Ithamar, son of Aaron the priest”. </p>
<hr />
Num 4:34 Moses, Aaron and the leaders of the community took a census of the Kohathites by clans and 
families: 

Num 4:35 all the men between thirty and fifty years of age, eligible for military service, for duties in the Tent of 
Meeting. 

Num 4:36 The number of men counted in their clans came to two thousand seven hundred and fifty. 

Num 4:37 Such was the total number of men in the Kohathite clans who were eligible for duties in the Tent of 
Meeting and whom Moses and Aaron counted at Yahweh’s bidding through Moses. 

Num 4:38 A census was taken of the Gershonites by clans and families: 

Num 4:39 all the men between thirty and fifty years of age, eligible for military service, for duties in the Tent of 
Meeting. 

Num 4:40 The number of men counted in their clans and families came to two thousand six hundred and thirty. 
Num 4:41 Such was the total number of men in the Gershonite clans who were eligible for duties in the Tent of 
Meeting, and whom Moses and Aaron counted at Yahweh’s bidding. 

Num 4:42 A census was taken of the Merarite clans by clans and families: 



Num 4:43 all the men between thirty and fifty years of age, eligible for military service, for duties in the Tent of 
Meeting. 

Num 4:44 The number of men counted in their clans came to three thousand two hundred. 

Num 4:45 Such was the total number of men in the Merarite clans, whom Moses and Aaron counted at 
Yahweh’s bidding through Moses. 

Num 4:46 The total number of Levites whom Moses, Aaron and the leaders of Israel counted in their clans and 
families, 

Num 4:47 all the men between thirty and fifty years of age, eligible for religious duties and for those of 
transporting the Tent of Meeting 

Num 4:48 came to eight thousand five hundred and eighty. 

Num 4:49 At Yahweh’s bidding through Moses, a census was taken of them and each man was assigned his 
duty and load. And so the census was conducted by Moses as Yahweh had ordered him. 

Num 5:1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: 

Num 5:2 “Order the Israelites to expel from the camp all those suffering from a contagious skin-disease or from 
a discharge, or who have become unclean by touching a corpse. 

Num 5:3 Whether man or woman, you will expel them; you will expel them from the camp, so that they do not 
pollute their encampments, in the heart of which I dwell”. 

Num 5:4 The Israelites did so: they expelled them from the camp. The Israelites did as Yahweh had told Moses. 
Num 5:5 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, 

Num 5:6 “Speak to the Israelites: ‘If a man or woman commits any of the sins by which people break faith with 
Yahweh, that person incurs guilt. 

Num 5:7 ‘The person must confess the sin committed and restore in full the amount owed, with one-fifth added. 
Payment is to be made to the person wronged. 

Num 5:8 ‘If, however, the latter has no relation to whom restitution can be made, the restitution due to Yahweh 
reverts to the priest, apart from the ram of expiation with which the priest makes expiation for the guilty party. 
Num 5:9 For of everything the Israelites consecrate and bring to the priest he has a right to the portion set 
aside. 

Num 5:10 Whatever anyone consecrates is his own; whatever is given to the priest belongs to the priest’”. 

Num 5:1 1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, 

Num 5:12 “Speak to the Israelites and say: ‘If anyone has a wife who goes astray and is unfaithful to him, 

Num 5:13 if some other man sleeps with the woman without the husband’s knowledge, and she secretly makes 
herself unclean, without any witness against her, and without anyone catching her in the act; 

Num 5:14 if, then, a spirit of suspicion comes over the husband and makes him suspicious of the wife who has 
disgraced herself, or again if this spirit of suspicion comes over him and makes him suspicious of his wife even 
when she is innocent, 

Num 5:15 the man will bring his wife before the priest, and on her behalf make an offering of one-tenth of an 
ephah of barley meal. He will not pour oil over it or put incense on it, because this is a cereal offering for a case 
of suspicion, a memorial offering to recall guilt to mind. 

Num 5:16 ‘The priest will then bring the woman forward and place her before Yahweh. 

Num 5:17 The priest will then take fresh water in an earthen jar, and on the water throw dust that he has taken 
from the floor of the Dwelling. 

Num 5:18 After he has placed the woman before Yahweh, he will unbind her hair and put the commemorative 
cereal offering (that is, the cereal offering for a case of suspicion) into her hands. In his own hands the priest will 
hold the water of bitterness and cursing. 

Num 5:19 ‘The priest will then put the woman on oath. He will say to her: If it is not true that a man has slept 
with you, that you have gone astray and made yourself unclean while under your husband’s authority, may this 
water of bitterness and cursing do you no harm. 

Num 5:20 But if it is true that you have gone astray while under your husband’s authority, that you have made 
yourself unclean and that a man other than your husband has slept with you . . . 

Num 5:21 Here the priest will impose an imprecatory oath on the woman. He will say to her: . . . May Yahweh 
make you the object of your people’s execration and curses, by making your sexual organs shrivel and your belly 
swell! 

Num 5:22 May this water of cursing entering your bowels, make your belly swell and your sexual organs shrivel! 
To which the woman will reply: Amen! Amen! 

Num 5:23 ‘Having written these curses on a scroll and washed them off in the water of bitterness, 

Num 5:24 the priest will make the woman drink the water of bitterness and cursing; when the water of cursing 
enters into her, it will become bitter. 

Num 5:25 ‘The priest will then take the cereal offering for a case of suspicion from the woman’s hands, and hold 
it up before Yahweh with a gesture of offering, and so carry it up to the altar. 



Num 5:26 He will take a handful of it as a memorial and burn it on the altar. ‘After this, he will make the woman 
drink the water. 

Num 5:27 After he has made her drink it, if it is true that she has made herself unclean and been unfaithful to 
her husband, the water of cursing then entering into her will indeed be bitter: her belly will swell and her sexual 
organs shrivel, and she will be an object of execration to her people. 

Num 5:28 But if she has not made herself unclean, but is clean, then she will go unscathed and will bear 
children. 

Num 5:29 ‘Such is the ritual in cases of suspicion, when a woman has gone astray and made herself unclean 
while under her husband’s authority, 

Num 5:30 or when a spirit of suspicion has come over a man and made him suspicious of his wife. When a 
husband brings such a woman before Yahweh, the priest will apply this ritual to her in full. 

Num 5:31 The husband will be guiltless, but the woman will bear the consequences of her guilt’”. 

Num 6:1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, 

Num 6:2 “Speak to the Israelites and say: ‘If a man or a woman wishes to make a vow, the nazirite vow, to vow 
himself to Yahweh, 

Num 6:3 he will abstain from wine and fermented liquor, he will not drink vinegar derived from one or the other, 
he will not drink grape-juice or eat grapes, be they fresh or dried. 

Num 6:4 For the duration of his vow he will eat nothing that comes from the vine, not even juice of unripe grapes 
or skins of grapes. 

Num 6:5 As long as he is bound by his vow, no razor will touch his head; until the time for which he has vowed 
himself to Yahweh is completed, he remains consecrated and will let his hair grow freely. 

Num 6:6 For the entire period of his vow to Yahweh, he will not go near a corpse, 

Num 6:7 he will not make himself unclean for his father or his mother, or his brother or his sister, should they 
die, since on his head he carries his vow to his God. 

Num 6:8 Throughout the whole of his vow he is a person consecrated to Yahweh. 

Num 6:9 ‘If anyone suddenly dies near him, making his vowed hair unclean, he will shave his head on the day 
he is purified, he will shave his head on the seventh day. 

Num 6:10 On the eighth day, he will bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest, at the entrance to 
the Tent of Meeting. 

Num 6:1 1 The priest will offer one as a sacrifice for sin, and the other as a burnt offering and will then perform 
for the person the rite of expiation for the pollution which he has contracted from the corpse. He will consecrate 
his head that same day; 

Num 6:12 he will vow himself to Yahweh for the period of his nazirate, and will bring a male yearling lamb as a 
sacrifice of reparation. The time already spent will not count, since his hair had become unclean. 

Num 6:13 ‘This is the ritual for the nazirite on the day when the period of his vow is completed. He will be led to 
the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, 

Num 6:14 bringing his offering to Yahweh: an unblemished male yearling lamb as a burnt offering, an 
unblemished yearling ewe lamb as a sacrifice for sin, an unblemished ram as a peace offering, 

Num 6:15 and a basket of unleavened loaves made of fine flour mixed with oil, and of unleavened wafers 
spread with oil, with the cereal offerings and libations appropriate to them. 

Num 6:16 The priest, having brought all this before Yahweh, will offer the nazirite’s sin sacrifice and burnt 
offering. 

Num 6:17 The latter will then offer the ram as a communion sacrifice with the basket of unleavened bread, and 
the priest will offer the accompanying cereal offering and libation. 

Num 6:18 The nazirite will then shave off his vowed hair at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and, taking the 
locks of his vowed head, he will put them in the fire of the communion sacrifice. 

Num 6:19 The priest will take the shoulder of the ram, as soon as it is cooked, with an unleavened cake from 
the basket, and an unleavened wafer, and put them into the hands of the nazirite once he has shaved off his 
hair. 

Num 6:20 With these he will make the gesture of offering before Yahweh; as it is a holy thing, it reverts to the 
priest, in addition to the forequarter that has been presented and the thigh that has been set aside. After this, the 
nazirite may drink wine. 

Num 6:21 ‘Such is the ritual for the nazirite. If, besides his hair, he has also vowed a personal offering to 
Yahweh, he will (apart from anything else that his means allow) fulfil the vow that he has made, in addition to 
what the ritual prescribes for his hair’”. 

Num 6:22 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, 

Num 6:23 “Speak to Aaron and his sons and say: ‘This is how you must bless the Israelites. You will say: 

Num 6:24 May Yahweh bless you and keep you. 

Num 6:25 May Yahweh let his face shine on you and be gracious to you. 



Num 6:26 May Yahweh show you his face and bring you peace’. 

Num 6:27 This is how they must call down my name on the Israelites, and then I shall bless them”. 

Num 7:1 On the day Moses finished erecting the Dwelling, he anointed and consecrated it and all its furniture, 
as well as the altar and all its equipment. When he had anointed and consecrated it all, 

Num 7:2 the leaders of Israel made an offering; they were the heads of their families, the tribal leaders who had 
presided over the census. 

Num 7:3 They brought their offering before Yahweh: six covered wagons and twelve oxen, one wagon for every 
two leaders and one ox each. They brought them in front of the Dwelling. 

Num 7:4 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, 

Num 7:5 “Accept these from them, and let them be set apart for the service of the Tent of Meeting. You will give 
them to the Levites, to each as his duties require”. 

Num 7:6 Moses took the wagons and oxen, and gave them to the Levites. 

Num 7:7 To the Gershonites he gave two wagons and four oxen for the duties they had to perform. 

Num 7:8 To the Merarites he gave four wagons and eight oxen for the duties they had to perform under the 
direction of Ithamar, son of Aaron the priest. 

Num 7:9 But to the Kohathites he gave none at all, because the sacred charge entrusted to them had to be 
carried on their shoulders. 

Num 7:10 The leaders then made an offering for the dedication of the altar, on the day it was anointed. They 
brought their offering before the altar, 

Num 7:11 and Yahweh said to Moses, “Each day one of the leaders must bring his offering for the dedication of 
the altar”.

Num 7:89 When Moses went into the Tent of Meeting to speak with him, he heard the voice speaking to him 
from above the mercy-seat on the ark of the Testimony, from between the two great winged creatures. He then 
spoke to him. 

Num 8:1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: 

Num 8:2 “Speak to Aaron and say, ‘When you set up the lamps, the seven lamps must throw their light towards 
the front of the lamp-stand’”. 

Num 8:3 Aaron did this. He set up the lamps to the front of the lamp-stand, as Yahweh had ordered Moses. 

Num 8:4 This lamp-stand was worked in beaten gold, including its stem and its petals, which were also of 
beaten gold. This lamp-stand had been made according to the pattern Yahweh had shown to Moses. 

Num 8:5 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, 

Num 8:6 “Separate the Levites from the Israelites and purify them. 

Num 8:7 This is how you must purify them: you will sprinkle them with purifying water, and they will shave their 
bodies all over and wash their clothes. They will then be clean. 

Num 8:8 They will then take a young bull, with the accompanying cereal offering of fine flour mixed with oil, and 
you will take a second young bull for a sacrifice for sin. 

Num 8:9 You will then bring the Levites in front of the Tent of Meeting, and assemble the whole community of 
Israelites. 

Num 8:10 Once you have brought the Levites before Yahweh, the Israelites will lay their hands on them. 

Num 8:1 1 Aaron will then offer the Levites, making the gesture of offering before Yahweh on behalf of the 
Israelites, admitting them to Yahweh’s service. 

Num 8:12 “The Levites will then lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, one of which you will offer as a 
sacrifice for sin, and the other as a burnt offering to Yahweh, to perform the rite of expiation for the Levites. 

Num 8:13 Having brought the Levites before Aaron and his sons, you will present them to Yahweh with the 
gesture of offering. 

Num 8:14 That is how you will set the Levites apart from the Israelites, for them to be mine. 

Num 8:15 The Levites will then begin their ministry in the Tent of Meeting. “You will purify them and offer them 
with the gesture of offering 

Num 8:16 because, of the Israelites, they have been dedicated to me in place of all those who first emerge from 
the womb, instead of the first-born; of all the Israelites, I have taken them for my own. 

Num 8:17 For all the first-born of the Israelites, whether human or animal, do indeed belong to me: the day I 
struck down all the first-born in Egypt, I consecrated them to myself, 

Num 8:18 and now, in place of all the first-born of the Israelites, I have taken the Levites. 

Num 8:19 Of the Israelites, I give the Levites to Aaron and his sons, as dedicated men, to minister in the Tent of 
Meeting on behalf of the Israelites and perform the rite of expiation for them, so that no disaster befalls the 
Israelites when the Israelites come close to the sanctuary”. 

Num 8:20 Moses, Aaron and the whole community of Israelites dealt with the Levites exactly as Yahweh had 
ordered Moses concerning them; this is what the Israelites did with them. 

Num 8:21 The Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes, and Aaron presented them with the 
gesture of offering before Yahweh. He then performed the rite of expiation for them to purify them. 



Num 8:22 The Levites were then allowed to perform their ministry in the Tent of Meeting in the presence of 
Aaron and his sons. As Yahweh had ordered Moses concerning the Levites, so it was done with them. 

Num 8:23 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: 

Num 8:24 This concerns the Levites. From the age of twenty-five onwards, the Levite will exercise his ministry 
and do duty in the Tent of Meeting. 

Num 8:25 After the age of fifty, he is no longer bound to the ministry; he will have no further duties; 

Num 8:26 but he will still help his brothers to assure the services in the Tent of Meeting, though he himself will 
no longer have any ministry. That is how you will act as regards the ministry of the Levites”. 

Num 9:1 Yahweh spoke to Moses, in the desert of Sinai, in the second year after the exodus from Egypt, in the 
first month, and said: 

Num 9:2 The Israelites must keep the Passover at its appointed time. 

Num 9:3 The fourteenth day of this month, at twilight, is the time appointed for you to keep it. You will keep it 
with all the laws and customs proper to it”. 

Num 9:4 Moses told the Israelites to keep the Passover. 

Num 9:5 They kept it, in the desert of Sinai, in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at twilight. 
The Israelites did everything as Yahweh had ordered Moses. 

Num 9:6 It happened that some men had become unclean by touching a dead body; they could not keep the 
Passover that day. They came the same day to Moses and Aaron, 

Num 9:7 and said, “We have become unclean by touching a dead body. Why should we be excluded from 
bringing an offering to Yahweh at the proper time with the rest of the Israelites?”. 

Num 9:8 Moses replied, “Wait here until I hear what order Yahweh gives about you”. 

Num 9:9 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, 

Num 9:10 “Speak to the Israelites and say: ‘Any of you or your descendants who becomes unclean by touching 
a dead body, or is away on a long journey, can still keep a Passover for Yahweh. 

Num 9:1 1 Such persons will keep it in the second month, on the fourteenth day, at twilight. They will eat it with 
unleavened bread and bitter herbs; 

Num 9:12 nothing of it must be left over until morning, nor will they break any of its bones. They will keep it, 
following the entire Passover ritual. 

Num 9:13 But anyone who is clean, or who is not on a journey, but fails to keep the Passover, such a person 
will be outlawed from his people. For not having brought the offering to Yahweh at its appointed time, the person 
will bear the consequences of the sin. 

Num 9:14 ‘A resident alien who keeps a Passover for Yahweh, will keep it in accordance with the ritual and 
customs of the Passover. You will have one law for alien and citizen alike’”. 

Num 9:15 On the day the Dwelling was erected, the cloud covered the Dwelling, the Tent of the Testimony. 
From nightfall until morning it remained over the Dwelling looking like fire. 

Num 9:16 So the cloud covered it all the time, and at night it looked like fire. 

Num 9:17 Whenever the cloud rose from the Tent, the Israelites broke camp, and wherever the cloud halted, 
there the Israelites pitched camp. 

Num 9:18 At Yahweh’s order, the Israelites set out and, at Yahweh’s order, the Israelites pitched camp. They 
remained in camp for as long as the cloud rested on the Dwelling. 

Num 9:19 If the cloud stayed for many days on the Dwelling, the Israelites performed their duty to Yahweh and 
did not set out. 

Num 9:20 But if the cloud happened to stay for only a few days on the Dwelling, just as they had pitched camp 
at Yahweh’s order, at Yahweh’s order they set out. 

Num 9:21 If the cloud happened to remain only from evening to morning, they set out when it lifted the next 
morning. Or, if it stayed for a whole day and night, they set out only when it lifted. 

Num 9:22 Sometimes it stayed there for two days, a month, or a longer time; however long the cloud rested on 
the Dwelling, the Israelites remained in camp, and when it lifted they set out. 

Num 9:23 At Yahweh’s order they pitched camp, and at Yahweh’s order they set out. They performed their duty 
to Yahweh, as Yahweh had ordered through Moses. 

Num 10:1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: 

Num 1 0:2 “Make yourself two trumpets; make them of beaten silver, so that you can use them for summoning 
the community, and for sounding the order to break camp. 

Num 1 0:3 Whenever they are sounded, the whole community must gather round you, at the entrance to the 
Tent of Meeting. 

Num 1 0:4 But if only one trumpet is sounded, then only the leaders, the heads of Israel’s thousands, must 
gather round you. 

Num 10:5 “When the trumpet blast is accompanied by a battle cry, the encampments pitched to the east will set 
out. 



Num 10:6 At the second blast accompanied by a battle cry, the encampments pitched to the south will set out. 
For breaking camp, the trumpet blast will be accompanied by a battle cry, 

Num 10:7 but for assembling the community the trumpets will be sounded without battle cry. 

Num 1 0:8 The Aaronite priests will sound the trumpets; this is a perpetual decree for you and your descendants. 
Num 10:9 “When in your country you go to war against an enemy who is oppressing you, you will sound 
trumpets with a battle cry, and Yahweh your God will remember you, and you will be delivered from your 
enemies. 

Num 10:10 At your festivals, solemnities and new-moon feasts, you will sound the trumpets over your burnt 
offerings and communion sacrifices, so that they recall you to the remembrance of your God. I am Yahweh your 
God”. 

Num 10:1 1 In the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, the cloud rose from 
where the Dwelling of the Testimony was, 

Num 10:12 and the Israelites set out, in marching order, from the desert of Sinai. The cloud came to rest in the 
desert of Paran. 

Num 10:13 These were the men who set out in the vanguard, at Yahweh’s order through Moses: 

Num 10:14 first went the standard of the camp of the Judahites and their units, with Nahshon son of 
Amminadab commanding that contingent; 

Num 10:15 Nethanel son of Zuar commanding the tribal contingent of the Issacharites; 

Num 10:16 and Eliab son of Helon commanding the tribal contingent of the Zebulunites. 

Num 10:17 The Dwelling was then dismantled and the Gershonites and Merarites set out, carrying the Dwelling. 
Num 10:18 Then came the standard of the camp of the Reubenites and their units, with Elizur son of Shedeur 
commanding that contingent; 

Num 10:19 Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai commanding the tribal contingent of the Simeonites; 

Num 10:20 and Eliasaph son of Reuel commanding the tribal contingent of the Gadites. 

Num 10:21 Then came the Kohathites carrying the sanctuary (the Dwelling was erected before they arrived). 
Num 10:22 Then came the standard of the camp of the Ephraimites and their units, with Elishama son of 
Ammihud commanding that contingent; 

Num 10:23 Gamaliel son of Pedahzur commanding the tribal contingent of the Manassehites; 

Num 1 0:24 and Abidan son of Gideoni commanding the tribal contingent of the Benjaminites. 

Num 1 0:25 Last of all, the rearguard of all the camps, came the standard of the camp of the Danites and their 
units, with Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai commanding that contingent; 

Num 1 0:26 Pagiel son of Ochran commanding the tribal contingent of the Asherites; 

Num 1 0:27 and Ahira son of Enan commanding the tribal contingent of the Naphtalites. 

Num 1 0:28 Such was the order of march for the Israelites, unit by unit. So they set out. 

Num 1 0:29 Moses said to Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, his father-in-law, “We are setting out for the country 
of which Yahweh has said: I shall give it to you. Come with us, and we will treat you well, for Yahweh has 
promised good things for Israel”. 

Num 10:30 “I will not come with you”, he replied, “but shall go to my own country and kin”. 

Num 10:31 “Do not leave us”, Moses said, “for you know where we can camp in the desert, and so you will be 
our eyes. 

Num 10:32 If you come with us, we shall share with you whatever blessings Yahweh gives us”. 

Num 1 0:33 They set out from Yahweh’s mountain and travelled for three days, while the ark of the covenant of 
Yahweh preceded them on the three-day journey, searching out a place for them to halt. 

Num 10:34 In the daytime, Yahweh’s cloud was over them, once they had broken camp. 

Num 1 0:35 Whenever the ark set out, Moses would say: Rise, Yahweh, may your enemies be scattered and 
those who hate you flee at your approach! 

Num 10:36 And when it halted, he would say: Come back, Yahweh, to the countless thousands of Israel! 

Num 11:1 Now the people began to complain, which was offensive to Yahweh’s ears. When Yahweh heard, his 
anger was aroused and the fire of Yahweh broke out among them; it devoured one end of the camp. 

Num 1 1:2 The people appealed to Moses who interceded with Yahweh and the fire died down. 

Num 1 1:3 So the place was called Taberah, because the fire of Yahweh had broken out among them. 

Num 1 1:4 The rabble who had joined the people were feeling the pangs of hunger, and the Israelites began to 
weep again. “Who will give us meat to eat?”. they said. 

Num 1 1 :5 “Think of the fish we used to eat free in Egypt, the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions and garlic! 

Num 1 1 :6 But now we are withering away; there is nothing wherever we look except this manna!”.  

Num 1 1 :7 The manna was like coriander seed and had the appearance of bdellium. 

Num 1 1:8 The people went round gathering it, and ground it in a mill or crushed it with a pestle; it was then 

cooked in a pot and made into pancakes. It tasted like cake made with oil. 

Num 1 1 :9 When the dew fell on the camp at night-time, the manna fell with it. 



Num 11:10 Moses heard the people weeping, each family at the door of its tent. Yahweh’s anger was greatly 
aroused; Moses too found it disgraceful, 

Num 11:11 and he said to Yahweh: “Why do you treat your servant so badly? In what respect have I failed to 
win your favour, for you to lay the burden of all these people on me? 

Num 11:12 Was it I who conceived all these people, was I their father, for you to say to me, ‘Carry them in your 
arms, like a foster-father carrying an unweaned child, to the country which I swore to give their fathers?’ 

Num 11:13 Where am I to find meat to give all these people, pestering me with their tears and saying, ‘Give us 
meat to eat?’ 

Num 11:14 I cannot carry all these people on my own; the weight is too much for me. 

Num 11:15 If this is how you mean to treat me, please kill me outright! If only I could win your favour and be 
spared the sight of my misery!”.  

Num 11:16 Yahweh said to Moses, “Collect me seventy of the elders of Israel, men you know to be the people’s 
elders and scribes. Bring them to the Tent of Meeting, and let them stand beside you there. 

Num 11:17 I shall come down and talk to you there and shall take some of the spirit which is on you and put it 
on them. Then they will bear the burden of the people with you, and you will no longer have to bear it on your 
own. 

Num 11:18 “And say to the people, ‘Purify yourselves for tomorrow and you will have meat to eat, since you 
have wept in Yahweh’s hearing, saying: Who will give us meat to eat? How happy we were in Egypt! Very well, 
Yahweh will give you meat to eat. 

Num 11:19 You will eat it not for one day, or two, or five, or ten or twenty, 

Num 1 1 :20 but for a whole month, until it comes out of your nostrils and sickens you, since you have rejected 
Yahweh who is among you, and have wept before him saying: Why did we ever leave Egypt?’”. 

Num 1 1 :2 1 Moses said, “The people round me number six hundred thousand foot soldiers, and you say, ‘I shall 
give them meat to eat for a whole month!’. 

Num 1 1 :22 If all the flocks and herds were slaughtered, would that be enough for them? If all the fish in the seas 
were collected, would that be enough for them?”. 

Num 1 1 :23 Yahweh said to Moses, “Is the arm of Yahweh so short? You shall see whether the promise I have 
made to you comes true or not”. 

Num 1 1 :24 Moses went out and told the people what Yahweh had said. Then he collected seventy of the 
people’s elders and stationed them round the Tent. 

Num 1 1 :25 Yahweh descended in the cloud. He spoke to him and took some of the spirit that was on him and 
put it on the seventy elders. When the spirit came on them they prophesied — but only once. 

Num 1 1:26 Two men had stayed back in the camp; one was called Eldad and the other Medad. The spirit came 
down on them; though they had not gone to the Tent, their names were enrolled among the rest. These began to 
prophesy in the camp. 

Num 1 1 :27 A young man ran to tell Moses this. “Look”, he said, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp”. 
Num 1 1 :28 Joshua son of Nun, who had served Moses since he was a boy, spoke up and said, “My lord Moses, 
stop them!”.  

Num 1 1 :29 Moses replied, “Are you jealous on my account? If only all Yahweh’s people were prophets, and 
Yahweh had given them his spirit!”.  

Num 1 1 :30 Moses then went back to the camp with the elders of Israel. 

Num 11:31 A wind, sent by Yahweh, started blowing from the sea bringing quails which it deposited on the 
camp. They lay for a distance of a day’s march either side of the camp, two cubits thick on the ground. 

Num 1 1 :32 The people were up all that day and night and all the next day collecting quails: the least gathered 
by anyone was ten <i>homer</i>; then they spread them out round the camp. 

Num 1 1 :33 The meat was still between their teeth, not even chewed, when Yahweh’s anger was aroused by the 
people. Yahweh struck them with a very great plague. 

Num 1 1 :34 The name given to this place was Kibroth-ha-Taavah, because it was there that they buried the 
people who had indulged their greed. 

Num 1 1:35 From Kibroth-ha-Taavah the people set out for Hazeroth, and at Hazeroth they pitched camp. 

Num 12:1 Miriam, and Aaron too, criticised Moses over the Cushite woman he had married. He had indeed 
married a Cushite woman. 

Num 12:2 They said, “Is Moses the only one through whom Yahweh has spoken? Has he not spoken through us 
too?”. Yahweh heard this. 

Num 12:3 Now Moses was extremely humble, the humblest man on earth. 

Num 12:4 Suddenly Yahweh said to Moses, Aaron and Miriam, “Come out, all three of you, to the Tent of 
Meeting”. They went, all three of them, 

Num 12:5 and Yahweh descended in a pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the Tent. He called Aaron 
and Miriam and they both came forward. 



Num 12:6 Yahweh said: Listen to my words! if there is a prophet among you, I reveal myself to him in a vision, I 
speak to him in a dream. 

Num 12:7 Not so with my servant Moses; to him my whole household is entrusted; 

Num 12:8 to him I speak face to face, plainly and not in riddles, and he sees Yahweh’s form. How, then, could 
you dare to criticise my servant Moses? 

Num 12:9 Yahweh’s anger was aroused by them. He went away, 

Num 12:10 and as soon as the cloud left the Tent, there was Miriam covered with a virulent skin-disease, white 
as snow! Aaron turned to look at her and saw that she had contracted a virulent skin-disease. 

Num 12:1 1 Aaron said to Moses: “Oh, my Lord, please do not punish us for the sin we have been foolish 
enough to commit. 

Num 12:12 Do not let her be like some monster with its flesh half eaten away when it leaves its mother’s womb!”.  
Num 12:13 Moses pleaded with Yahweh. “O God”, he said, “I beg you, please heal her!”.  

Num 12:14 Yahweh then said to Moses, “If her father had done no more than spit in her face, would she not be 
unclean for seven days? Have her shut out of the camp for seven days, and then have her brought in again”. 

Num 12:15 Miriam was shut out of the camp for seven days. The people did not set out until she returned. 

Num 12:16 Then the people moved on from Hazeroth and pitched camp in the desert of Paran. 

Num 13:1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, 

Num 13:2 “Send out men, one from each tribe, to reconnoitre the land of Canaan which I am giving the 
Israelites. Each of them is to be a leading man of the tribe”. 

Num 1 3:3 At Yahweh’s order, Moses sent them from the desert of Paran. All of them were leading men of Israel. 
Num 1 3:4 These were their names: For the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zaccur: 

Num 1 3:5 for the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori; 

Num 1 3:6 for the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh; 

Num 1 3:7 for the tribe of of Issachar, Igal son of Joseph; 

Num 1 3:8 for the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea son of Nun; 

Num 1 3:9 for the tribe of Benjamin, Palti son of Raphu; 

Num 13:10 for the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel son of Sodi; 

Num 13:1 1 for the tribe of Joseph, for the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi son of Susi; 

Num 13:12 for the tribe of Dan, Ammiel son of Gemalli; 

Num 13:13 for the tribe of Asher, Sethur son of Michael; 

Num 13:14 for the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi son of Vophsi; 

Num 13:15 for the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Machi. 

Num 13:16 Such were the names of the men whom Moses sent to reconnoitre the country. Moses then gave 
Hoshea son of Nun the name Joshua. 

Num 13:17 Moses sent them to reconnoitre the land of Canaan, “Go up into the Negeb”, he said, “then go up into 
the highlands. 

Num 13:18 See what sort of country it is, and what sort of people the inhabitants are, whether they are strong or 
weak, few or many, 

Num 13:19 what sort of land they live on, whether it is good or poor; what sort of towns they live in, whether they 
are open or fortified; 

Num 1 3:20 what sort of land it is, fertile or barren, wooded or open. Be bold, and bring back some of the 
country’s produce”. It was the season for early grapes. 

Num 13:21 They went up and reconnoitred the country from the desert of Zin to Rehob, the Pass of Hamath. 
Num 13:22 They went up by way of the Negeb as far as Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai and Talmai, the 
Anakim, lived. (Hebron was founded seven years before Tanis in Egypt.) 

Num 1 3:23 Reaching the Vale of Eshcol, there they lopped off a vine branch with a cluster of grapes, which two 
of them carried away on a pole, as well as pomegranates and figs. 

Num 1 3:24 This place was called the Vale of Eshcol after the cluster which the Israelites cut there. 

Num 13:25 After forty days they returned from reconnoitring the country. 

Num 1 3:26 Making their way to Moses, Aaron and the whole community of Israel, in the desert of Paran, at 
Kadesh, they made their report to them and the whole community, and displayed the country’s produce. 

Num 1 3:27 This was the report they gave: “We made our way into the country where you sent us. It does indeed 
flow with milk and honey; here is what it produces. 

Num 13:28 At the same time, its inhabitants are a powerful people; the towns are fortified and very big; yes, and 
we saw the Anakim there. 

Num 13:29 The Amalekites occupy the Negeb area, the Hittites, Jebusites and Amorites the highlands, and the 
Canaanites the sea coast and the banks of the Jordan”. 

Num 13:30 Caleb called the people round Moses to silence and then said, “We must march in immediately and 
take it; we are certainly able to conquer it”. 



Num 13:31 But the men who had been with him said, “We cannot attack these people; they are stronger than we 
are”. 

Num 13:32 And they began disparaging to the Israelites the country they had reconnoitred, saying, “The country 
we have been to reconnoitre is a country that devours its inhabitants. All the people we saw there were of 
enormous size. 

Num 13:33 We saw giants there too (the Anakim, descended from the Giants). We felt like grasshoppers, and 
so we seemed to them”. 

Num 14:1 The whole community then cried out in dismay, and the people wept all that night. 

Num 14:2 All the Israelites muttered at Moses and Aaron, and the whole community said to them, “Would to 
God we had died in Egypt, or even that we had died in this desert! 

Num 14:3 Why has Yahweh brought us to this country, for us to perish by the sword and our wives and children 
to be seized as booty? Should we not do better to go back to Egypt?”. 

Num 14:4 And they said to one another, “Let us appoint a leader and go back to Egypt”. 

Num 14:5 At this, Moses and Aaron threw themselves on their faces in front of the whole assembled community 
of Israelites, 

Num 14:6 while Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, two of the men who had reconnoitred the 
country, tore their clothes 

Num 14:7 and addressed the whole community of Israelites as follows, “The country we went to reconnoitre is a 
good country, an excellent country. 

Num 14:8 If Yahweh is pleased with us, he will lead us into this country and give it to us. It is a country flowing 
with milk and honey. 

Num 1 4:9 But do not rebel against Yahweh or be afraid of the people of the country, for we shall gobble them 
up. Their protecting shade has deserted them, while we have Yahweh on our side. Do not be afraid of them”. 
Num 14:10 The whole community was talking of stoning them, when the glory of Yahweh appeared to all the 
Israelites, inside the Tent of Meeting, 

Num 14:1 1 and Yahweh said to Moses: “How much longer will these people treat me with contempt? How much 
longer will they refuse to trust me, in spite of all the signs I have displayed among them? 

Num 14:12 I shall strike them with pestilence and disown them. And of you I shall make a new nation, greater 
and mightier than they are”. 

Num 14:13 Moses said to Yahweh: “Suppose the Egyptians hear about this — for by your power you brought 
these people out of their country- 

Num 14:14 and tell the people living in this country. They have heard that you, Yahweh, are with this people, 
and that you, Yahweh, show yourself to them face to face; that your cloud stands over them and that you go 
before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. 

Num 14:15 If you kill this people now as though it were one man, then the nations who have heard about you 
will say, 

Num 14:16 ‘Yahweh was not able to bring this people into the country which he had sworn to give them, and so 
he has slaughtered them in the desert’. 

Num 14:17 No, my Lord! Now is the time to assert your power as you promised when you said, earlier, 

Num 14:18 ‘Yahweh, slow to anger and rich in faithful love, forgiving faults and transgression, and yet letting 
nothing go unchecked, punishing the parents’ guilt in the children to the third and fourth generation’. 

Num 14:19 In your most faithful love, please forgive this people’s guilt, as you have done from Egypt until now”. 
Num 14:20 Yahweh said, “I forgive them as you ask. 

Num 14:21 But — as I live, and as the glory of Yahweh fills the whole world- 

Num 14:22 of all these people who have seen my glory and the signs that I worked in Egypt and in the desert, 
who have put me to the test ten times already and not obeyed my voice, 

Num 14:23 not one shall see the country which I promised to give their ancestors. Not one of those who have 
treated me contemptuously will see it. 

Num 14:24 However, since my servant Caleb is of another spirit and since he has obeyed me completely, I shall 
bring him into the country where he has been, and his descendants will own it 

Num 14:25 (the Amalekites and Canaanites occupy the plain). Tomorrow you will turn about and go back into 
the desert, in the direction of the Sea of Suph”. 

Num 14:26 Yahweh then spoke to Moses and Aaron and said: 

Num 14:27 “How much longer am I to endure this perverse community muttering against me? I have heard what 
the Israelites mutter against me. 

Num 14:28 Say to them, ‘As I live, Yahweh declares, I shall do to you what I have heard you saying. 

Num 14:29 In this desert your dead bodies will fall, all you who were counted in the census, from the age of 
twenty years and over who have muttered against me. 

Num 14:30 I swear none of you will enter the country where I swore most solemnly to settle you, except Caleb 



son of Jephunneh, and Joshua son of Nun. 

Num 14:31 Your children, who you said would be seized as booty, will be the ones whom I shall bring in so that 
they get to know the country you disdained, 

Num 14:32 but, as for you, your dead bodies will fall in this desert 

Num 14:33 and your children will be nomads in the desert for forty years, bearing the consequences of your 
faithlessness, until the last one of you lies dead in the desert. 

Num 14:34 For forty days you reconnoitred the country. Each day will count as a year: for forty years you will 
bear the consequences of your guilt and learn what it means to reject me’. 

Num 14:35 I, Yahweh, have spoken: this is how I swear to treat this entire perverse community united against 
me. In this desert, to the last man, they shall die”. 

Num 14:36 The men whom Moses had sent to reconnoitre the country and who on their return had incited the 
whole community of Israel to mutter about him by disparaging it, 

Num 14:37 these men who had disparaged the country were all struck dead before Yahweh. 

Num 14:38 Of the men who had gone to reconnoitre the country, only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of 
Jephunneh were left alive. 

Num 14:39 When Moses told all the Israelites what had been said, the people set up a great outcry. 

Num 14:40 Early next morning they set out for the heights of the hill country saying, “Look, we will set out for the 
place about which Yahweh said that we have sinned”. 

Num 14:41 To which, Moses said, “Why disobey Yahweh’s order? No success will come of doing so. 

Num 14:42 Do not go, for Yahweh is not among you, and you will be defeated by your enemies. 

Num 14:43 For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are ahead of you, and you will be put to the sword, since you 
have turned away from Yahweh, and Yahweh is not with you”. 

Num 1 4:44 All the same, they presumptuously set off for the heights of the hill country. Neither the ark of the 
covenant of Yahweh nor Moses left the camp. 

Num 14:45 The Amalekites and Canaanites living in those highlands then came down, defeated them and 
harried them all the way to Hormah. 

Num 15:1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, 

Num 15:2 “Speak to the Israelites and say: ‘When you have arrived in the country where you are to live and 
which I am giving to you, 

Num 15:3 and you burn food as an offering to Yahweh either as a burnt offering or as a sacrifice, whether in 
payment of a vow, or as a voluntary gift, or on the occasion of one of your solemn feasts, from your herds and 
flocks as a smell pleasing to Yahweh: 

Num 1 5:4 the offerer will, as his personal gift to Yahweh, bring a cereal offering of one-tenth of an ephah of fine 
flour mixed with one-quarter of a hin of oil. 

Num 1 5:5 You will also make a libation of wine, one-quarter of a hin to each lamb, in addition to the burnt 
offering or sacrifice. 

Num 1 5:6 For a ram, you will make a cereal offering of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with one-third 
of a hin of oil, 

Num 1 5:7 and a libation of one-third of a hin of wine as a smell pleasing to Yahweh. 

Num 1 5:8 If you offer a bull as a burnt offering or sacrifice, in payment of a vow or as a communion sacrifice for 
Yahweh, 

Num 1 5:9 in addition to the animal you will offer a cereal offering of three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed 
with half a hin of oil, 

Num 15:10 and you will offer a libation of half a hin of wine, as food burnt as a smell pleasing to Yahweh. 

Num 15:1 1 This will be done for every bull, every ram, every lamb or kid. 

Num 15:12 Whatever the number of victims you intend to offer, you will do the same for each of them, however 
many there are. 

Num 15:13 ‘Every citizen of the country will act in this way whenever he offers food burnt as a smell pleasing to 
Yahweh; 

Num 15:14 and if an alien residing with you or with your descendants intends to offer food burnt as a smell 
pleasing to Yahweh, he will do as you do. 

Num 15:15 There will be one law for you, members of the community, and the resident alien alike, a law binding 
your descendants for ever: before Yahweh you and the resident alien are no different”. 

Num 15:16 One law, one statute, will apply for you and the resident alien’”. 

Num 15:17 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, 

Num 15:18 “Speak to the Israelites and say: ‘When you have entered the country to which I am bringing you, 
Num 15:19 you will set a portion aside for Yahweh when you eat that country’s bread. 

Num 15:20 You will set one cake aside as the first-fruits of your dough; you will set this offering aside like the 
one set aside from your threshing. 



Num 15:21 For all future generations you will set a portion of your dough aside for Yahweh. 

Num 15:22 ‘If through inadvertence you fail in any of these orders which Yahweh has given to Moses 
Num 1 5:23 (whatever orders Yahweh has given you or your descendants through Moses, from the day when 
Yahweh gave his orders), 

Num 15:24 this is what must be done: ‘If it is an inadvertence on the part of the community, the community as a 
whole will offer a young bull as a burnt offering, as a smell pleasing to Yahweh, with the prescribed 
accompanying cereal offering and libation, and a he-goat as a sacrifice for sin. 

Num 1 5:25 The priest will perform the rite of expiation for the entire community of Israelites, and they will be 
forgiven, since it was an inadvertence. Once they have brought their offering as food burnt for Yahweh, and have 
presented their sacrifice for sin before Yahweh to make amends for their inadvertence, 

Num 15:26 the whole community of Israelites will be forgiven, as also the alien residing with them, since the 
entire people acted by inadvertence. 

Num 15:27 ‘If it is an individual who has sinned by inadvertence, he will offer a yearling kid as a sacrifice for sin. 
Num 15:28 The priest will perform the rite of expiation before Yahweh for the person who has gone astray owing 
to this sin of inadvertence and, expiation having been made for him, he will be forgiven; 

Num 15:29 whether he is an Israelite citizen or a resident alien, you will have one law for anyone who sins by 
inadvertence. 

Num 1 5:30 ‘But the individual who acts deliberately, be he citizen or alien, commits an outrage against Yahweh, 
and such a man will be outlawed from his people. 

Num 15:31 Since he has treated Yahweh’s word with contempt and has disobeyed his order, such a man will be 
outlawed absolutely and will bear the consequences of his guilt’”. 

Num 15:32 While the Israelites were in the desert, a man was caught gathering wood on the Sabbath day. 

Num 15:33 Those who caught him gathering wood brought him before Moses, Aaron and the whole community. 
Num 15:34 He was kept in custody, because the penalty he should undergo had not yet been fixed. 

Num 1 5:35 Yahweh said to Moses, This man must be put to death. The whole community will stone him outside 
the camp”. 

Num 15:36 The whole community took him outside the camp and stoned him till he was dead, as Yahweh had 
ordered Moses. 

Num 15:37 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, 

Num 1 5:38 “Speak to the Israelites and tell them, for all generations to come, to put tassels on the hems of their 
clothes and work a violet thread into the tassel at the hem. 

Num 1 5:39 You will thus have a tassel, and the sight of it will remind you of all Yahweh’s orders and how you 
are to put them into practice, and not follow the dictates of your own heart and eyes, which have led you to be 
unfaithful. 

Num 15:40 “This will remind you of all my orders; put them into practice, and you will be consecrated to your 
God. 

Num 15:41 I, Yahweh your God, have brought you out of Egypt, to be your God, I, Yahweh your God”. 

Num 16:1 Now Korah son of Izhar, son of Kohath the Levite, and the Reubenites Dathan and Abiram sons of 
Eliab, and On son of Peleth were proud 

Num 16:2 and rebelled against Moses with two hundred and fifty Israelites who were leaders of the community, 
prominent at the solemn feasts, men of repute. 

Num 16:3 These banded together against Moses and Aaron and said to them, “You take too much on 
yourselves! The whole community, all its members, are consecrated, and Yahweh lives among them. Why set 
yourselves higher than Yahweh’s community?”. 

Num 16:4 On hearing this, Moses threw himself on his face. 

Num 16:5 Then he said to Korah and all in his party, “Tomorrow morning Yahweh will reveal who is his, who the 
consecrated man whom he will allow to approach him. The one he allows to approach is the one whom he has 
chosen. 

Num 16:6 This is what you must do: take the censers of Korah and all in his party, 

Num 16:7 put fire in them and put incense in them before Yahweh tomorrow, and the one whom Yahweh 
chooses will be the consecrated man. Levites, you take too much on yourselves!”.  

Num 16:8 Moses then said to Korah, “Now listen, you Levites! 

Num 1 6:9 Is it not enough for you that the God of Israel has singled you out of the community of Israel, and 
called you to be near him, to serve in Yahweh’s Dwelling and to represent the community by officiating on its 
behalf? 

Num 16:10 He has called you to be near him, you and all your brother Levites with you, and now you want to be 
priests as well! 

Num 16:1 1 For which reason, you and all in your party have banded together against Yahweh himself: for what 
is Aaron, that you should mutter against him?”. 



Num 16:12 Moses then summoned Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab. They replied, “We will not come. 

Num 16:13 Is it not enough for you to have brought us away from a country flowing with milk and honey to kill us 
in the desert, without your making yourself our absolute ruler? 

Num 16:14 What is more, you have not brought us to a country flowing with milk and honey and you have not 
given us fields and vineyards for our heritage. Do you think you can hoodwink these people? We will not come”. 
Num 16:15 Moses flew into a rage and said to Yahweh, “Disregard their cereal offering! I have not taken so 
much as a donkey from them, nor have I wronged any of them”. 

Num 16:16 Moses said to Korah, “You and all your party, come before Yahweh tomorrow, you and they, and 
Aaron too. 

Num 16:17 Each will take his censer, put incense in it, and bring his censer before Yahweh — two hundred and 
fifty censers. You and Aaron too will each bring his censer”. 

Num 16:18 Each of them took his censer, put fire in it and placed incense on it, and stood at the entrance to the 
Tent of Meeting with Moses and Aaron. 

Num 16:19 Then, Korah having assembled the whole community to confront them at the entrance to the Tent of 
Meeting, the glory of Yahweh appeared to the whole community. 

Num 16:20 Yahweh then spoke to Moses and Aaron. He said, 

Num 16:21 “Get away from this community. I am going to destroy them here and now”. 

Num 1 6:22 They threw themselves on their faces and cried out, “O God, God of the spirits that give life to every 
living thing, will you be angry with the whole community because one man has sinned?”. 

Num 16:23 Yahweh then said to Moses, 

Num 16:24 “Speak to the community and say, ‘Stand well clear of Korah’s tent’”. 

Num 16:25 Moses stood up and went to Dathan and Abiram; the elders of Israel followed him. 

Num 16:26 He spoke to the community and said, “Stand away, I tell you, from the tents of these sinners, and 
touch nothing that belongs to them, for fear that with all their sins you too will be swept away”. 

Num 1 6:27 So they moved away from Korah’s tent. Dathan and Abiram had come out and were standing at 
their tent doors, with their wives, their sons and their little ones. 

Num 1 6:28 Moses said, “This is how you will know that Yahweh himself has sent me to perform all these tasks 
and that I am not doing them of my own accord. 

Num 16:29 If these people die a natural death such as people commonly die, then Yahweh has not sent me. 
Num 16:30 But if Yahweh does something utterly new, if the earth should open its mouth and swallow them and 
all their belongings, so that they go down alive to Sheol, then you will know that they held Yahweh in contempt”. 
Num 1 6:31 The moment he finished saying all this, the ground split apart under their feet, 

Num 16:32 the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, their families, all Korah’s people and all their 
property. 

Num 1 6:33 They went down alive to Sheol with all their belongings. The earth closed over them and they 
disappeared in the middle of the community. 

Num 1 6:34 At their cries, all the Israelites round them took to their heels, saying, “We do not want the earth to 
swallow us too!”.  

Num 16:35 Fire then shot out from Yahweh and consumed the two hundred and fifty men offering incense. 

Num 17:1 Yahweh then spoke to Moses and said, 

Num 17:2 “Tell Eleazar son of Aaron the priest to pick the censers out of the smouldering remains and scatter 
the fire from them away from here, 

Num 17:3 for these sinful censers have become sanctified at the price of human lives. Since they were brought 
before Yahweh and thus became consecrated, they must be hammered into sheets to cover the altar. They will 
be an object-lesson to the Israelites”. 

Num 17:4 The priest Eleazar took the bronze censers which had been carried by the men destroyed by the fire. 
They were hammered into sheets to cover the altar. 

Num 17:5 They are a reminder to the Israelites that no unauthorised person, no one not of Aaron’s line, may 
approach and offer incense before Yahweh, on pain of suffering the fate of Korah and his party, as Yahweh had 
said through Moses. 

Num 17:6 On the following day, the whole community of Israelites were muttering against Moses and Aaron and 
saying, “You are responsible for killing Yahweh’s people!”.  

Num 17:7 Now, as the community was banding together against Moses and Aaron, they turned towards the 
Tent of Meeting, and there was the cloud covering it, and the glory of Yahweh appeared. 

Num 17:8 Moses and Aaron then went to the front of the Tent of Meeting. 

Num 17:9 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, 

Num 17:10 “Get away from this community. I am going to destroy them here and now”. They threw themselves 
on their faces. 

Num 17:1 1 Moses then said to Aaron, “Take a censer, put fire in it from the altar, place incense on it and hurry 



to the community to perform the rite of expiation for them: for retribution has come from Yahweh, plague has 
broken out”. 

Num 17:12 Aaron took it as Moses said and ran into the middle of the community, but plague had already 
broken out among the people. He put in the incense and performed the rite of expiation for the people. 

Num 17:13 Then he stood between the living and the dead, and the plague stopped. 

Num 17:14 There were fourteen thousand seven hundred victims of the plague, apart from those who died 
because of Korah. 

Num 17:15 Aaron then went back to Moses at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting; the plague had been halted. 
Num 17:16 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, 

Num 17:17 “Tell the Israelites to give you a branch for each of their families, one for each leader of each family: 
twelve branches. Write the name of each on his branch; 

Num 17:18 and on the branch of Levi write Aaron’s name, since the head of the Levite families must have a 
branch too. 

Num 17:19 You will then put them inside the Tent of Meeting in front of the Testimony, where I make myself 
known to you. 

Num 17:20 The man whose branch sprouts will be the one I have chosen; this is how I shall put an end to the 
mutterings of the Israelites about you”. 

Num 17:21 Moses spoke to the Israelites, and all their leaders gave him one branch each, twelve branches in all 
for their families; Aaron’s branch was among them. 

Num 17:22 Moses placed them before Yahweh in the Tent of the Testimony. 

Num 17:23 On the following day Moses went to the Tent of the Testimony and there, already sprouting, was 
Aaron’s branch, representing the House of Levi; buds had formed, flowers had bloomed and almonds had 
already ripened. 

Num 17:24 Moses then brought out all the branches from before Yahweh to all the Israelites; they examined 
them and each one took back his own branch. 

Num 17:25 Yahweh then said to Moses, “Put Aaron’s branch back in front of the Testimony, where it will have its 
ritual place as a warning to the rebellious; thus you will rid me of their muttering for good, without their incurring 
death”. 

Num 17:26 Moses did as Yahweh had ordered. That is what he did. 

Num 17:27 The Israelites then said to Moses, “We are lost! We are dead men! We are all dead men! 

Num 17:28 Anyone who approaches Yahweh’s Dwelling with an offering will die. Are we to be doomed to the 
last man?”. 

Num 18:1 Yahweh then said to Aaron: “You, your sons and your ancestor’s line with you will be answerable for 
offences against the sanctuary. You and your sons with you will be answerable for the offences of your 
priesthood. 

Num 18:2 You will admit your brothers of the branch of Levi, your ancestor’s tribe, to join you and serve you, 
yourself and your sons, before the Tent of the Testimony. 

Num 18:3 They must be at your service and the service of the whole Tent. Provided they do not come near the 
sacred vessels or the altar, they will be in no more danger of death than you. 

Num 18:4 They must join you, they must take charge of the Tent of Meeting for the entire ministry of the Tent, 
and no unauthorised person will come near you. 

Num 18:5 You will take charge of the sanctuary and charge of the altar, and retribution will never again befall 
the Israelites. 

Num 18:6 Of the Israelites, I myself have chosen your brothers the Levites as a gift to you. As men dedicated, 
they will belong to Yahweh, to serve at the Tent of Meeting. 

Num 18:7 You and your sons will undertake the priestly duties in all that concerns the altar and all that lies 
behind the curtain. You will perform the liturgy, the duties of which I entrust to your priesthood. But an 
unauthorised person approaching will incur death”. 

Num 18:8 Yahweh said to Aaron: “I myself have put you in charge of everything set aside for me. Everything 
consecrated by the Israelites I give to you and your sons as your portion by perpetual decree. 

Num 18:9 Of the things especially holy, of the food offered, this is what will revert to you: every offering that the 
Israelites give back to me, whether it be a cereal offering, a sacrifice for sin or a sacrifice of reparation, is a thing 
especially holy and will revert to you and your sons. 

Num 18:10 You will eat the things especially holy. Every male may eat them. You will regard them as sacred. 
Num 18:1 1 “To you will revert also whatever is set aside from the offerings of the Israelites, whatever is held out 
with the gesture of offering; this I give to you and your sons and daughters, by perpetual decree. All members of 
your household may eat it unless they are unclean. 

Num 18:12 All the best of the oil, all the best of the new wine and wheat, these first-fruits offered by them to 
Yahweh I give to you. 



Num 18:13 All the first produce of the country brought by them to Yahweh will revert to you. All members of your 
household may eat it unless they are unclean. 

Num 18:14 Everything in Israel put under the curse of destruction will revert to you. 

Num 18:15 Every first-born of all creatures brought to Yahweh, human or animal, will revert to you, but you will 
have to redeem the first-born of man; you will also redeem the first-born of an unclean animal. 

Num 18:16 You will redeem it in the month in which it is born, valuing it at five shekels, at the sanctuary shekel, 
which is twenty <i>gerah</i>. 

Num 18:17 But you will not redeem the first-born of cow, sheep and goat. They are holy: you will sprinkle their 
blood on the altar and burn the fat as food burnt to be a smell pleasing to Yahweh; 

Num 18:18 the meat will revert to you, as will the forequarter that has been presented with the gesture of 
offering, and the right thigh. 

Num 18:19 Everything the Israelites set aside for Yahweh from the holy things, I give to you and your sons and 
daughters, by perpetual decree. This is a covenant of salt for ever before Yahweh, for you and your descendants 
too”. 

Num 18:20 Yahweh said to Aaron: “You will have no heritage in their country, you will not have a portion like 
them; I shall be your portion and your heritage among the Israelites. 

Num 18:21 “Look, as heritage I give the Levites all the tithes collected in Israel, in return for their services, for 
the ministry they render in the Tent of Meeting. 

Num 18:22 The Israelites will no longer approach the Tent of Meeting, on pain of committing a deadly sin. 

Num 18:23 Levi will discharge the duties of the Tent of Meeting, and the Levites will bear the consequences of 
their own guilt. This is a perpetual decree binding all your descendants: the Levites will have no heritage among 
the Israelites, 

Num 1 8:24 for the tithe which the Israelites set aside for Yahweh is the heritage I have given the Levites. This is 
why I have told them that they will have no heritage among the Israelites”. 

Num 18:25 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, 

Num 18:26 “Speak to the Levites and say: ‘When from the Israelites you receive the tithe which I have given you 
from them as your heritage, you will set a portion of this aside for Yahweh: a tithe of the tithe. 

Num 1 8:27 It will take the place of the portion set aside that is due from you, like the wheat from the threshing- 
floor and new wine from the press. 

Num 18:28 Thus you too will set a portion aside for Yahweh out of all the tithes you receive from the Israelites. 
You will give what you have set aside for Yahweh to the priest Aaron. 

Num 1 8:29 Out of all the gifts you receive, you will set a portion aside for Yahweh. Out of all these things, you 
will set aside the best, the sacred portion’. 

Num 18:30 “You will say to them, ‘After you have set the best aside, the remainder will take the place, in the 
Levites’ case, of the produce of the threshing-floor and wine-press. 

Num 18:31 You may consume this anywhere, you and the members of your households; this is your 
recompense for serving in the Tent of Meeting, 

Num 18:32 and you will not incur sin by doing so, once you have set aside the best; you will not be profaning 
the things consecrated by the Israelites and will not incur death’”. 

Num 19:1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron and said: 

Num 19:2 “This is a decree of the Law which Yahweh has prescribed. Tell the Israelites, they are to bring you a 
red heifer without fault or blemish that has never borne the yoke. 

Num 1 9:3 You will give it to the priest Eleazar. It will then be taken outside the camp and slaughtered in his 
presence. 

Num 1 9:4 The priest Eleazar will then take some of the victim’s blood on his finger, and sprinkle this blood 
seven times towards the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 

Num 19:5 The heifer will then be burnt while he looks on; its hide, flesh, blood and offal will be burnt. 

Num 1 9:6 The priest will then take some cedar wood, hyssop and scarlet material and throw them on the fire 
where the heifer is burning. 

Num 1 9:7 He will then wash his clothes and bathe himself; after which he will go back to the camp, though he 
will remain unclean until evening. 

Num 19:8 The man who has burnt the heifer will wash his clothes and bathe himself and will remain unclean 
until evening. 

Num 19:9 The man who gathers up the ashes of the heifer must be ritually clean; he will deposit them outside 
the camp, in a clean place. They will be kept for the ritual use of the Israelite community for making water for 
purification; it is a sacrifice for sin. 

Num 19:10 The man who has gathered up the ashes of the heifer will wash his clothes and remain unclean until 
evening. For the Israelites as for the resident alien, this will be a perpetual decree. 

Num 19:11 “Anyone who touches the corpse of anyone whatever will be unclean for seven days. 



Num 19:12 Such a person must be purified with these waters on the third and seventh day and will then be 
clean; otherwise he will not be clean. 

Num 19:13 Anyone who touches the corpse of anyone who has died and is not purified, defiles Yahweh’s 
Dwelling; such a person will be outlawed from Israel, since the water for purification has not been sprinkled over 
him; he is unclean, and his uncleanness remains in him. 

Num 19:14 “This is the law when someöne dies in a tent. Anyone who goes into the tent, or anyone who is 
already in it, will be unclean for seven days, 

Num 19:15 and every open vessel with no cover tied over it will also be unclean. 

Num 19:16 “Anyone in the open country who touches a murder victim, a corpse, human bones or a grave will be 
unclean for seven days. 

Num 19:17 “For someöne thus unclean, some of the ashes of the victim burnt as a sacrifice for sin will be taken 
and spring water must be poured over them, in a vessel. 

Num 19:18 Someöne who is ritually clean will then take some hyssop and dip it in the water. This person will 
then sprinkle the tent, all the vessels and people who were there, and similarly anyone who has touched human 
bones, a murder victim, a corpse or a grave. 

Num 19:19 On the third and the seventh day the clean one will sprinkle the unclean, who on the seventh day will 
be clean. The latter will then wash his clothes and bathe in water, and in the evening he will be clean. 

Num 19:20 Anyone who fails to be purified in this way will be outlawed from the community, and would defile 
Yahweh’s sanctuary. Such a person is unclean, not having been sprinkled with the water for purification. 

Num 19:21 “This will be a perpetual decree for them. The person who sprinkles the water for purification will 
wash his clothes, and anyone who touches the water for purification will be unclean until evening. 

Num 19:22 Anything that an unclean person touches will be unclean, and anyone who touches it will be unclean 
until evening”. 

Num 20:1 The Israelites, the whole community, arrived in the first month at the desert of Zin. The people settled 
at Kadesh. There Miriam died and was buried. 

Num 20:2 There was no water for the community, so they banded together against Moses and Aaron. 

Num 20:3 The people laid the blame on Moses. “We would rather have died”, they said, “as our brothers died 
before Yahweh! 

Num 20:4 Why have you brought Yahweh’s community into this desert, for us and our livestock to die here? 

Num 20:5 Why did you lead us out of Egypt, only to bring us to this wretched place? It is a place unfit for 
sowing, it has no figs, no vines, no pomegranates, and there is not even water to drink!”.  

Num 20:6 Leaving the assembly, Moses and Aaron went to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. They threw 
themselves on their faces, and the glory of Yahweh appeared to them. 

Num 20:7 Yahweh then spoke to Moses and said, 

Num 20:8 “Take the branch and call the community together, you and your brother Aaron. Then, in full view of 
them, order this rock to release its water. You will release water from the rock for them and provide drink for the 
community and their livestock”. 

Num 20:9 Moses took up the branch from before Yahweh, as he had directed him. 

Num 20:10 Moses and Aaron then called the assembly together in front of the rock. He then said to them, 

“Listen now, you rebels. Shall we make water gush from this rock for you?”. 

Num 20:1 1 Moses then raised his hand and struck the rock twice with the branch; water gushed out in 
abundance, and the community and their livestock drank. 

Num 20:12 Yahweh then said to Moses and Aaron, “Because you did not believe that I could assert my holiness 
before the Israelites’ eyes, you will not lead this assembly into the country which I am giving them”. 

Num 20:13 These were the Waters of Meribah, where the Israelites laid the blame on Yahweh and where, by 
their means, he asserted his holiness. 

Num 20:14 Moses sent messengers from Kadesh: “To the king of Edom. Your brother Israel says this: You are 
aware of the great hardships we have encountered. 

Num 20:15 Our ancestors went down to Egypt and there we stayed for a long time. But the Egyptians treated us 
badly, as they had our ancestors. 

Num 20:16 When we appealed to Yahweh, he heard our cry and, sending an angel, brought us out of Egypt, 
and here we are, now, at Kadesh, a town on the borders of your territory. 

Num 20:17 We ask permission to pass through your country. We shall not go through the fields or vineyards; we 
shall not drink the water from the wells; we shall keep to the king’s highway without turning to right or left until we 
have passed through your territory”. 

Num 20:18 To which, Edom replied, “You will not pass through my country; if you do, I shall oppose you by force 
of arms”. 

Num 20:19 To which the Israelites replied, “We shall keep to the high road; if I and my flocks drink any of your 
water, I am willing to pay for it. All I am asking is to pass through on foot”. 



Num 20:20 Edom replied: “You shall not pass”, and Edom opposed them in great numbers and great force. 

Num 20:21 At Edom’s refusal to grant Israel passage through his territory, Israel turned away. 

Num 20:22 They set out from Kadesh, and the Israelites, the whole community, came to Mount Hor. 

Num 20:23 Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron at Mount Hor, on the frontier of Edom, and said, 

Num 20:24 “Aaron is to be gathered to his people; he will not enter the country which I have given to the 
Israelites, since you both disobeyed my order at the Waters of Meribah. 

Num 20:25 Take Aaron and his son Eleazar and bring them up Mount Hor. 

Num 20:26 Then take Aaron’s robes off him and dress his son Eleazar in them. Aaron will then be gathered to 
his people; that is where he will die”. 

Num 20:27 Moses did as Yahweh ordered. With the whole community watching, they went up Mount Hor. 

Num 20:28 Moses took Aaron’s robes off him and dressed his son Eleazar in them, and there Aaron died, on 
the mountain-top. Moses and Eleazar then came back down the mountain. 

Num 20:29 The whole community saw that Aaron had died, and for thirty days the whole House of Israel 
mourned for Aaron. 

Num 21:1 The king of Arad, the Canaanite living in the Negeb, learned that Israel was coming by way of 
Atharim. He attacked Israel and took some prisoners. 

Num 21 :2 Israel then made this vow to Yahweh, “If you deliver this people into my power, I shall curse their 
towns with destruction”. 

Num 21:3 Yahweh heard Israel’s words and delivered the Canaanites into their power, and they destroyed them 
in accordance with their curse. Hence the place was given the name Hormah. 

Num 21 :4 They left Mount Hor by the road to the Sea of Suph, to skirt round Edom. On the way the people lost 
patience. 

Num 21 :5 They spoke against God and against Moses, “Why did you bring us out of Egypt to die in the desert? 
For there is neither food nor water here; we are sick of this meagre diet”. 

Num 21:6 At this, God sent fiery serpents among the people; their bite brought death to many in Israel. 

Num 21:7 The people came and said to Moses, “We have sinned by speaking against Yahweh and against you. 
Intercede for us with Yahweh to save us from these serpents”. Moses interceded for the people, 

Num 21:8 and Yahweh replied, “Make a fiery serpent and raise it as a standard. Anyone who is bitten and looks 
at it will survive”. 

Num 21 :9 Moses then made a serpent out of bronze and raised it as a standard, and anyone who was bitten by 
a serpent and looked at the bronze serpent survived. 

Num 21:10 The Israelites set out and camped at Oboth. 

Num 21:11 Then they left Oboth and camped at lye-Abarim, in the desert on the eastern border of Moab. 

Num 21:12 They set out from there and camped in the gorge of the Zered. 

Num 21:13 They set out from there and camped on the other side of the Arnon. This gorge in the desert begins 
in the territory of the Amorites. For the Arnon is the frontier of Moab, between the Moabites and the Amorites. 
Num 21:14 That is why it says in the Book of the Wars of Yahweh: “. . .Waheb near Suphah and the gorges of 
the Arnon 

Num 21:15 and the slope of the ravine running down to the site of Ar and over against the frontier of Moab”. 

Num 21:16 And from there they went to Beer, that being the well in connection with which Yahweh had said to 
Moses, “Call the people together and I will give them water”. 

Num 21:17 Then it was that Israel sang this song: Spring up, well! Sing out for the well, 

Num 21:18 sunk by the princes, dug by the people’s leaders with the sceptre, with their staves! -and from the 
desert to Mattanah, 

Num 21:19 and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth, 

Num 21 :20 and from Bamoth to the valley that opens into the country of Moab, towards the heights of Pisgah 
overlooking the desert. 

Num 21:21 Israel sent messengers to say to Sihon king of the Amorites, 

Num 21 :22 “I wish to pass through your country. We shall not stray into the fields or vineyards; we shall not drink 
the water from the wells; we shall keep to the king’s highway until we have passed through your territory”. 

Num 21:23 But Sihon would not give Israel leave to pass through his country. He assembled all his people, 
marched into the desert to meet Israel, and reached Jahaz, where he gave battle to Israel. 

Num 21 :24 Israel defeated him by force of arms and conquered his country from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far 
as the Ammonites, for Jazer marked the Ammonite frontier. 

Num 21:25 Israel took all these towns. Israel occupied all the Amorite towns, Heshbon and all its dependencies, 
Num 21 :26 Heshbon being the capital of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had made war on the first king of 
Moab and captured all his territory as far as the Arnon. 

Num 21 :27 Hence the poets say: Come to Heshbon! Let the city of Sihon be rebuilt on firm foundations! 

Num 21 :28 For fire has burst from Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon, devouring Ar of Moab, engulfing the 



heights of the Arnon. 

Num 21 :29 Oh, unhappy Moab! People of Chemosh, you are lost! He has resigned his sons as fugitives, and his 
daughters as prisoners to Sihon king of the Amorites. 

Num 21:30 Their posterity has been destroyed from Heshbon all the way to Dibon, and we have lit a fire all the 
way from Nophah to Medeba. 

Num 21 :31 Thus Israel occupied the Amorites’ territory. 

Num 21:32 Moses then sent men to reconnoitre Jazer, and Israel took it and its dependencies, evicting the 
Amorites who lived there. 

Num 21:33 They then turned and marched on Bashan. Og king of Bashan and all his people marched to meet 
them and give battle at Edrei. 

Num 21 :34 Yahweh said to Moses, “Do not be afraid of him, for I have put him, all his people and his country at 
your mercy. Treat him as you treated Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon”. 

Num 21:35 So they pressed their attack against him, his sons and all his people until there was no one left alive. 
And they took possession of his country. 

Num 22:1 The Israelites then set out and pitched their camp in the Plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan opposite 
Jericho. 

Num 22:2 Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites, 

Num 22:3 and Moab was terrified of the people, because there were so many of them. Moab was afraid of the 
Israelites; 

Num 22:4 he said to the elders of Midian, “This horde will soon have cropped everything round us as closely as 
an ox crops grass in the countryside”. Now Balak son of Zippor was king of Moab at the time. 

Num 22:5 He sent messengers to summon Balaam son of Beor, at Pethor on the River, in the territory of the 
Amawites, saying, “Look, a people coming from Egypt has overrun the whole countryside; they have halted at my 
very door. 

Num 22:6 I beg you come and curse this people for me, for they are stronger than I am. We may then be able to 
defeat them and drive them out of the country. For this I know: anyone you bless is blessed, anyone you curse is 
accursed”. 

Num 22:7 The elders of Moab and the elders of Midian set out, taking the fee for the divination with them. They 
found Balaam and gave him Balak’s message. 

Num 22:8 He said to them, “Stay the night here, and I will answer as Yahweh directs me”. So the chiefs of Moab 
stayed with Balaam. 

Num 22:9 God came to Balaam and said, “Who are these men staying with you?”. 

Num 22:10 Balaam said to God, “Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent me this message, 

Num 22:1 1 ‘Look, a people coming from Egypt has overrun the whole countryside. Come now and curse them 
for me; I may then be able to defeat them and drive them out’”. 

Num 22:12 God said to Balaam, “You are not to go with them. You are not to curse the people, for they are 
blessed”. 

Num 22:13 In the morning Balaam got up and said to the chiefs sent by Balak, “Go back to your country, for 
Yahweh will not let me go with you”. 

Num 22:14 So the chiefs of Moab got up, went back to Balak and said, “Balaam refuses to come with us”. 

Num 22:15 And again Balak sent chiefs, more numerous and more renowned than the first. 

Num 22:16 They came to Balaam and said, “A message from Balak son of Zippor, ‘Now do not refuse to come 
to me. 

Num 22:17 I will load you with honours and do whatever you say. I beg you come and curse this people for me’. 

i 

Num 22:18 In reply, Balaam said to Balak’s envoys, “Even if Balak gave me his house full of silver and gold, I 
could not go against the order of Yahweh my God in anything, great or small. 

Num 22:19 Now please stay the night here yourselves, and I will learn what else Yahweh has to tell me”. 

Num 22:20 God came to Balaam during the night and said to him, “Have not these men come to summon you? 
Get up, go with them, but do only what I tell you to do”. 

Num 22:21 Balaam got up and saddled his donkey and set out with the chiefs of Moab. 

Num 22:22 His going kindled Yahweh’s anger, and the angel of Yahweh took his stand on the road to bar his 
way. Balaam was riding his donkey and his two servants were with him. 

Num 22:23 Now the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand, and 
she turned off the road into the open country. Balaam then struck the donkey to turn her back onto the road. 

Num 22:24 The angel of Yahweh then went and stood on a narrow path among the vineyards, with a wall to the 
right and a wall to the left. 

Num 22:25 The donkey saw the angel of Yahweh and scraped against the wall, scraping Balaam’s foot against 
it, so he struck her again. 



Num 22:26 The angel of Yahweh then moved and stood in a place so narrow that there was no room to pass 
either to right or left. 

Num 22:27 When the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, she lay down under Balaam. Balaam flew into a rage 
and struck the donkey with his stick. 

Num 22:28 Yahweh then gave the donkey the power to talk, and she said to Balaam, “What harm have I done 
you, for you to strike me three times like this?”. 

Num 22:29 Balaam answered the donkey, “Because you have been making a fool of me! If I had been carrying 
a sword, I should have killed you by now”. 

Num 22:30 The donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey, and have I not been your mount all your life? 
Have I ever behaved like this with you before?”. “No”, he replied. 

Num 22:31 Yahweh then opened Balaam’s eyes and he saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the road with a 
drawn sword in his hand; and he bowed his head and threw himself on his face. 

Num 22:32 And the angel of Yahweh said to him, “Why did you strike your donkey three times like that? I myself 
had come to bar your way; while I am here your road is blocked. 

Num 22:33 The donkey saw me and turned aside because of me three times. You are lucky she did turn aside, 
or I should have killed you by now, though I would have spared her”. 

Num 22:34 Balaam said to the angel of Yahweh, “I have sinned. I did not know you were standing in the road to 
stop me. But if what I am doing displeases you, I will go home again”. 

Num 22:35 The angel of Yahweh said to Balaam, “Go with these men, but say only what I tell you to say”. So 
Balaam went on with the chiefs sent by Balak. 

Num 22:36 Balak learned that Balaam was coming and went out to meet him, in the direction of Ar in Moab, at 
the Arnon frontier on the country’s furthest boundary. 

Num 22:37 Balak said to Balaam, “Did I not send messengers to summon you? Why did you not come to me? 
Did you think, perhaps, I could confer no honours on you?”. 

Num 22:38 Balaam said to Balak, “I have come to you after all. I suppose you know I cannot say anything on my 
own? The words God puts into my mouth are what I shall say”. 

Num 22:39 Balaam set out with Balak. They came to Kiriath-Huzoth. 

Num 22:40 Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and offered portions to Balaam and the chiefs who were with him. 
Num 22:41 Next morning Balak took Balaam and brought him up to Bamoth-Baal, from where he could see the 
edge of the camp. 

Num 23:1 Balaam said to Balak, “Build me seven altars here and prepare me seven bulls and seven rams”. 

Num 23:2 Balak did as Balaam said and offered a burnt offering of one bull and one ram on each altar. 

Num 23:3 Balaam then said to Balak, “Stand beside your burnt offerings while I go away. Perhaps Yahweh will 
come and meet me. If he does, I shall tell you whatever he reveals to me”. And he withdrew to a bare hill. 

Num 23:4 God came to meet Balaam, who said to him, “I have prepared the seven altars and offered a burnt 
offering of one bull and one ram on each altar”. 

Num 23:5 Yahweh then put a prophecy into his mouth and said to him, “Go back to Balak, and that is what you 
must say to him”. 

Num 23:6 So Balaam went back to him, and found him still standing beside his burnt offering, with all the chiefs 
of Moab. 

Num 23:7 He then declaimed his poem as follows: Balak has brought me from Aram, the king of Moab from the 
hills of Kedem: “Come and curse Jacob for me, come and denounce Israel!”.  

Num 23:8 How shall I curse someöne whom God has not cursed, how denounce someöne God has not 
denounced? 

Num 23:9 Yes, from the top of the crags I see him, from the hills I descry him: a people that dwells on its own, 
not to be reckoned among other nations! 

Num 23:10 Who can count the dust of Jacob? Who can number the cloud of Israel? May I die the death of the 
just, and may my future be like theirs! 

Num 23:1 1 Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, and you 
have heaped blessings on them!”.  

Num 23:12 Balaam replied, “Am I to depart from what Yahweh puts into my mouth?”. 

Num 23:13 Balak then said, “Please come somewhere else. From here you can see only the fringe of them, you 
cannot see them all. Curse them for me over there”. 

Num 23:14 He led him to the Lookouts’ Field on the top of Pisgah. There he built seven altars and offered a 
burnt offering of one bull and one ram on each altar. 

Num 23:15 Balaam said to Balak, “Stand here beside your burnt offerings while I wait over there”. 

Num 23:16 God came to meet Balaam, he put a prophecy into his mouth and said to him, “Go back to Balak, 
and that is what you must say to him”. 

Num 23:17 So Balaam went to him and found him still standing beside his burnt offering and all the chiefs of 



Moab with him. “What did Yahweh say?”. Balak said to him. 

Num 23:18 Balaam then declaimed his poem, as follows: Stand up, Balak, and listen, give ear to me, son of 
Zippor. 

Num 23:19 God is no human being that he should lie, no child of Adam to change his mind. Is it his to say and 
not to do, is it his to speak and not fulfil? 

Num 23:20 The charge laid on me is to bless, I shall bless, and I cannot reverse it. 

Num 23:21 I have perceived no guilt in Jacob, have seen no perversity in Israel. Yahweh his God is with him, 
and a royal acclamation to greet him. 

Num 23:22 God has brought him out of Egypt, is like the wild ox’s horns to him. 

Num 23:23 There is no omen whatever against Jacob, no augury at all against Israel. Well may people say of 

Jacob, of Israel, “What has God achieved?”. 

Num 23:24 for here is a people like a lioness rising, poised like a lion to spring; nor will he lie down till he has 
devoured his prey and drunk the blood of his slain. 

Num 23:25 Balak said to Balaam, “Very well! Do not curse them. But at least do not bless them!”.  

Num 23:26 Balaam retorted to Balak, “Did I not tell you? Whatever Yahweh says, I must do”. 

Num 23:27 Balak then said to Balaam, “Come with me now and I shall take you somewhere else. From there 
perhaps it will please God to curse them for me”. 

Num 23:28 So Balak led Balaam to the summit of Peor, overlooking the wastelands. 

Num 23:29 Balaam then said to Balak, “Build me seven altars here and prepare me seven bulls and seven 

rams”. 

Num 23:30 Balak did as Balaam said and offered a burnt offering of one bull and one ram on each altar. 

Num 24:1 Balaam then saw that it pleased Yahweh to bless Israel. He did not go as before to seek omens but 
turned towards the desert. 

Num 24:2 Raising his eyes Balaam saw Israel settled tribe by tribe; the spirit of God came on him 

Num 24:3 and he declaimed his poem, as follows: The prophecy of Balaam son of Beor, the prophecy of the 

man with far-seeing eyes, 

Num 24:4 the prophecy of one who hears the words of God. He sees what Shaddai makes him see, receives 
the divine answer, and his eyes are opened. 

Num 24:5 How fair your tents are, Jacob, how fair your dwellings, Israel, 

Num 24:6 like valleys that stretch afar, like gardens by the banks of a river, like aloes planted by Yahweh, like 
cedars beside the waters! 

Num 24:7 A hero arises from their stock, he reigns over countless peoples. His king is greater than Agag, and 
his kingship held in honour. 

Num 24:8 God has brought him out of Egypt, is like the wild ox’s horns to him. He devours the corpses of his 
enemies, breaking their bones, piercing them with his arrows. 

Num 24:9 He has crouched, he has lain down, like a lion, like a lioness; who dare rouse him? Blessed be those 
who bless you, and accursed be those who curse you! 

Num 24:10 Balak flew into a rage with Balaam. He struck his hands together and said to Balaam, “I brought you 
to curse my enemies, and you have insisted on blessing them three times over! 

Num 24:1 1 So now go home as fast as your legs can carry you. I promised to load you with honours. Yahweh 
himself has deprived you of them”. 

Num 24:12 Balaam retorted to Balak, “Did I not tell the messengers you sent me, 

Num 24:13 ‘Even if Balak gave me his house full of gold and silver I could not go against Yahweh’s order and 
do anything of my own accord, whether for good or ill; whatever Yahweh says is what I shall say?’ 

Num 24:14 Now that I am going back to my own folk, let me warn you what this people will do to your people, in 
days to come”. 

Num 24:15 He then declaimed his poem, as follows: The prophecy of Balaam son of Beor, the prophecy of the 
man with far-seeing eyes, 

Num 24:16 the prophecy of one who hears the words of God, of one who knows the knowledge of the Most 
High. He sees what Shaddai makes him see, receives the divine answer, and his eyes are opened. 

Num 24:17 I see him — but not in the present. I perceive him — but not close at hand: a star is emerging from 
Jacob, a sceptre is rising from Israel, to strike the brow of Moab, the skulls of all the children of Seth. 

Num 24:18 Edom too will be a conquered land, Seir too will be a conquered land, when Israel exerts his 
strength, 

Num 24:19 when Jacob tramples on his enemies and destroys the last survivors of Ar. 

Num 24:20 Balaam then looked at Amalek and declaimed his poem, as follows: Amalek, the earliest of nations! 
But his posterity will perish forever. 

Num 24:21 He then looked at the Kenites and declaimed his poem, as follows: Your dwelling was firm, Kain, 
your nest perched high in the rock. 



Num 24:22 But the nest belongs to Beor; how long will you be Asshur’s captive? 

Num 24:23 He then declaimed his poem, as follows: The Sea-people are gathering in the north, 

Num 24:24 the vessels from the coasts of Kittim. They will bear down on Asshur, bear down on Eber; he too will 
perish forever. 

Num 24:25 Balaam then got up, left and went home, and Balak too went his way. 

Num 25:1 Israel settled at Shittim. The people gave themselves over to prostitution with Moabite women. 

Num 25:2 These invited them to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and bowed down before their 
gods. 

Num 25:3 With Israel thus committed to the Baal of Peor, Yahweh’s anger was aroused against them. 

Num 25:4 Yahweh said to Moses, Take all the leaders of the people. Impale them facing the sun, for Yahweh, 
to deflect his burning anger from Israel”. 

Num 25:5 Moses said to the judges of Israel, “Each of you will put to death those of his people who have 
committed themselves to the Baal of Peor”. 

Num 25:6 One of the Israelites came along, bringing the Midianite woman into his family, under the very eyes of 
Moses and the whole community of Israelites as they were weeping at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 

Num 25:7 The priest Phinehas son of Eleazar, son of Aaron, on seeing this, stood up, left the assembly, seized 
a lance, 

Num 25:8 followed the Israelite into the alcove, and there ran them both through, the Israelite and the woman, 
through the stomach. Thus the plague which had struck the Israelites was arrested. 

Num 25:9 In the plague twenty-four thousand of them had died. 

Num 25:10 Yahweh then spoke and said, 

Num 25:1 1 “The priest Phinehas son of Eleazar, son of Aaron has deflected my wrath from the Israelites, he 
being the only one of them to have the same zeal as I have; for which reason, I did not make an end of the 
Israelites in my zeal. 

Num 25:12 For this reason I say: To him I grant my covenant of peace. 

Num 25:13 To him and his descendants after him, this covenant will assure the priesthood forever. In reward 
for his zeal for his God, he will have the right to perform the ritual of expiation for the Israelites”. 

Num 25:14 The Israelite who had been killed (the one who was killed with the Midianite woman) was called 
Zimri son of Salu, leader of one of the Simeonite families. 

Num 25:15 The woman, the Midianite who was killed, was called Cozbi, daughter of Zur, chief of a clan, of a 
family, in Midian. 

Num 25:16 Yahweh then spoke to Moses and said, 

Num 25:17 “Harass the Midianites, strike them down, 

Num 25:18 for harassing you with their guile in the Peor affair and in the affair of their sister Cozbi, the daughter 
of a prince of Midian, the woman who was killed the day the plague came on account of the business of Peor”. 
Num 26:1 After this plague, Yahweh spoke to Moses and to the priest Eleazar son of Aaron and said: 

Num 26:2 “Take a census of the whole community of Israelites, by families: all those of twenty years and over, fit 
to bear arms in Israel”. 

Num 26:3 So Moses and the priest Eleazar took a census of them on the Plains of Moab, near the Jordan by 
Jericho. They counted 

Num 26:4 (as Yahweh had ordered Moses and the Israelites after leaving Egypt) men of twenty years and over: 
Num 26:5 Reuben, the first-born of Israel. The sons of Reuben: for Hanoch, the Hanochite clan; for Pallu, the 
Palluite clan; 

Num 26:6 for Hezron, the Hezronite clan; for Carmi, the Carmite clan. 

Num 26:7 These were the Reubenite clans. They numbered forty-three thousand seven hundred and thirty men. 
Num 26:8 The sons of Pallu: Eliab. 

Num 26:9 The sons of Eliab: Nemuel, Dathan and Abiram. These two, Dathan and Abiram, men of repute in the 
community, were the ones who revolted against Moses and Aaron; they belonged to Korah’s group when it 
revolted against Yahweh. 

Num 26:10 The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them (with Korah when that group perished), when fire 
consumed the two hundred and fifty men. They were a sign. 

Num 26:1 1 Korah’s sons, however, did not perish. 

Num 26:12 The sons of Simeon by clans: for Nemuel, the Nemuelite clan; for Jamin, the Jaminite clan; for 
Jachin, the Jachinite clan; 

Num 26:13 for Zerah, the Zerahite clan; for Shaul, the Shaulite clan. 

Num 26:14 These were the Simeonite clans. They numbered twenty-two thousand two hundred men. 

Num 26:15 The sons of Gad by clans: for Zephon, the Zephonite clan; for Haggi, the Haggite clan; for Shuni, the 
Shunite clan; 

Num 26:16 forOzni, the Oznite clan; for Eri, the Erite clan; 



Num 26:17 for Arod, the Arodite clan; for Areli, the Arelite clan. 

Num 26:18 These were the clans of the sons of Gad. They numbered forty thousand five hundred men. 

Num 26:19 The sons of Judah: Er and Onan. Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. 

Num 26:20 The other sons of Judah became clans: for Shelah, the Shelahite clan; for Perez, the Perezzite clan; 
for Zerah, the Zerahite clan. 

Num 26:21 The sons of Perez were: for Hezron, the Hezronite clan; for Hamul, the Hamulite clan. 

Num 26:22 These were the clans of Judah. They numbered seventy-six thousand five hundred men. 

Num 26:23 The sons of Issachar by clans: for Tola, the Tolaite clan; for Puvah, the Puvahite clan; 

Num 26:24 for Jashub, the Jashubite clan; for Shimron, the Shimronite clan. 

Num 26:25 These were the clans of Issachar. They numbered sixty-four thousand three hundred men. 

Num 26:26 The sons of Zebulun by clans: for Sered, the Seredite clan; for Elon, the Elonite clan; for Jahleel, the 
Jahleelite clan. 

Num 26:27 These were the clans of Zebulun. They numbered sixty thousand five hundred men. 

Num 26:28 The sons of Joseph by clans: Manasseh and Ephraim. 

Num 26:29 The sons of Manasseh: for Machir, the Machirite clan; Machir fathered Gilead: for Gilead, the 
Gileadite clan. 

Num 26:30 These were the sons of Gilead: for lezer, the lezerite clan; for Helek, the Helekite clan; 

Num 26:31 Asriel, the Asrielite clan; Shechem, the Shechemite clan; 

Num 26:32 Shemida, the Shemidaite clan; Hepher, the Hepherite clan. 

Num 26:33 Zelophehad son of Hepher had no sons, only daughters; the names of Zelophehad’s daughters 
were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah and Tirzah. 

Num 26:34 These were the clans of Manasseh. They numbered fifty-two thousand seven hundred men. 

Num 26:35 These were the sons of Ephraim by clans: for Shuthelah, the Shuthelahite clan; for Becher, the 
Becherite clan; for Tahan, the Tahanite clan. 

Num 26:36 These were the sons of Shuthelah: for Eran, the Eranite clan. 

Num 26:37 These were the clans of Ephraim. They numbered thirty-two thousand five hundred men. These 
were the sons of Joseph by clans. 

Num 26:38 The sons of Benjamin by clans: for Bela, the Belaite clan; for Ashbel, the Ashbelite clan; for Ahiram, 
the Ahiramite clan; 

Num 26:39 for Shephupham, the Shephuphamite clan; for Hupham, the Huphamite clan. 

Num 26:40 Bela’s sons were Ard and Naaman; for Ard, the Ardite clan; for Naaman, the Naamanite clan. 

Num 26:41 These were the sons of Benjamin by clans. They numbered forty-five thousand six hundred men. 
Num 26:42 These were the sons of Dan by clans: for Shuham, the Shuhamite clan. These were the sons of Dan 
by clans. 

Num 26:43 All the Shuhamite clans numbered sixty-four thousand four hundred men. 

Num 26:44 The sons of Asher by clans: for Imnah, the Imnahite clan; for Ishvi, the Ishvihite clan; for Beriah, the 
Beriahite clan. 

Num 26:45 For the sons of Beriah: for Heber, the Heberite clan; for Malchiel, the Malchielite clan. 

Num 26:46 The daughter of Asher was called Serah. 

Num 26:47 These were the clans of Asher. They numbered fifty-three thousand four hundred men. 

Num 26:48 The sons of Naphtali by clans: for Jahzeel, the Jahzeelite clan; for Guni, the Gunite clan; 

Num 26:49 for Jezer, the Jezerite clan; for Shillem, the Shillemite clan. 

Num 26:50 These were the clans of Naphtali as divided into clans. The sons of Naphtali numbered forty-five 
thousand four hundred men. 

Num 26:51 Of the Israelites thus numbered, there were six hundred and one thousand seven hundred and thirty 
men. 

Num 26:52 Yahweh then spoke to Moses and said, 

Num 26:53 “The country must be shared out among these as a heritage, proportionately to the number of those 
inscribed. 

Num 26:54 To the large in number you will give a large area of land, to the small in number a small area; to 
each the heritage will be in proportion to the number registered. 

Num 26:55 The sharing out of the country must, however, be done by lot. Each will receive a heritage 
proportionate to the number of names in their patriarchal tribes; 

Num 26:56 the heritage of each tribe will be shared out by lot, depending on its larger or smaller numbers”. 

Num 26:57 These, by clans, are the Levites that were registered: for Gershon, the Gershonite clan; for Kohath, 
the Kohathite clan; for Merari, the Merarite clan. 

Num 26:58 These are the Levite clans: the Libnite clan, the Hebronite clan, the Mahlite clan, the Mushite clan, 
the Korahite clan. Kohath fathered Amram. 

Num 26:59 Amram’s wife was called Jokebed daughter of Levi, born to him in Egypt. To Amram she bore 



Aaron, Moses and Miriam their sister. 

Num 26:60 Aaron fathered Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. 

Num 26:61 Nadab and Abihu died when they brought unauthorised fire before Yahweh. 

Num 26:62 Altogether twenty-three thousand males of one month and over were registered. They were not 
registered with the Israelites, since they were given no heritage with the Israelites. 

Num 26:63 Such were the men registered by Moses and the priest Eleazar who took a census of the Israelites 
on the Plains of Moab near the Jordan by Jericho. 

Num 26:64 Not one of them was among those whom Moses and the priest Aaron had registered when they 
counted the Israelites in the desert of Sinai; 

Num 26:65 for Yahweh had told them that these were to die in the desert and that none of them would be left 
except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun. 

Num 27:1 There then came forward the daughters of Zelophehad son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Machir, 
son of Manasseh; he belonged to the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph. His daughters’ names were Mahlah, 
Noah, Hoglah, Milcah and Tirzah. 

Num 27:2 They appeared before Moses, the priest Eleazar, the leaders and the whole community, at the 
entrance to the Tent of Meeting, and said, 

Num 27:3 “Our father died in the desert. He was not a member of the party who banded together against 
Yahweh, Korah’s party; it was for his own sin that he died without sons. 

Num 27:4 Why should our father’s name be lost to his clan? Since he had no son, give us some property like 
our father’s kinsmen”. 

Num 27:5 Moses took their case before Yahweh, 

Num 27:6 and Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, 

Num 27:7 “Zelophehad’s daughters are right in what they say. You will indeed give them a property to be their 
heritage among their father’s kinsmen; see that their father’s heritage is passed on to them. 

Num 27:8 Then speak to the Israelites and say, ‘If a man dies without sons, his heritage will pass to his 
daughter. 

Num 27:9 If he has no daughter, the heritage will go to his brothers. 

Num 27:10 If he has no brothers, his heritage will go to his father’s brothers. 

Num 27:1 1 If his father has no brothers, his heritage will go to the member of his clan who is most nearly 
related; it will become his property. This will be a legal rule for the Israelites, as Yahweh has ordered Moses’”. 
Num 27:12 Yahweh said to Moses, “Climb this mountain of the Abarim range, and look at the country which I 
have given to the Israelites. 

Num 27:13 After you have seen it, you will be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother was. 

Num 27:14 For you both rebelled in the desert of Zin when the community disputed with me and when I ordered 
you to assert my holiness before their eyes by means of the water”. (These were the Waters of Meribah of 
Kadesh, in the desert of Zin.) 

Num 27:15 Moses then said to Yahweh, 

Num 27:16 “May it please Yahweh, God of the spirits that give life to all living creatures, to appoint a leader for 
this community, 

Num 27:17 to be at their head in all their undertakings, a man who will lead them out and bring them in, so that 
Yahweh’s community will not be like sheep without a shepherd”. 

Num 27:18 Yahweh then said to Moses, “Take Joshua son of Nun, a man in whom the spirit dwells, and lay your 
hand on him. 

Num 27:19 Bring him before the priest Eleazar and the whole community and give him your orders in their 
presence, 

Num 27:20 conferring some of your own authority on him, so that the whole community of Israelites will obey 
him. 

Num 27:21 He will present himself to the priest Eleazar who will consult Yahweh on his behalf by means of the 
rite of the urim; at his command, they will go out and, at his command, they will come in, he and all the Israelites 
with him, the whole community”. 

Num 27:22 Moses did as Yahweh had ordered. He took Joshua, brought him before the priest Eleazar and the 
whole community, 

Num 27:23 laid his hands on him and gave him his orders, as Yahweh had directed through Moses. 

Num 28:1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, 

Num 28:2 “Give the Israelites this order: ‘Take care to bring me my offering, my sustenance in the form of food 
burnt as a smell pleasing to me, at the proper time’. 

Num 28:3 “You will then say to them: ‘This is the food which you will burn in offering to Yahweh: ‘Every day, two 
unblemished yearling lambs as a perpetual burnt offering. 

Num 28:4 You will offer the first lamb in the morning and the second lamb at twilight, 



Num 28:5 with a cereal offering of one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with one-quarter of a hin of crushed- 
olive oil. 

Num 28:6 Such was the perpetual burnt offering made on Mount Sinai as a pleasing smell, as food burnt for 
Yahweh. 

Num 28:7 The accompanying libation will be of one-quarter of a hin for each lamb; the libation of fermented 
liquor for Yahweh will be poured inside the sanctuary. 

Num 28:8 The second lamb you will offer at twilight, offering it with the same cereal offering and the same 
libation as in the morning, as food burnt as a smell pleasing to Yahweh. 

Num 28:9 ‘On the Sabbath day, you will offer two unblemished yearling lambs and two-tenths of an ephah of 
fine flour as a cereal offering, mixed with oil, as well as the accompanying libation. 

Num 28:10 The Sabbath burnt offering will be offered every Sabbath in addition to the perpetual burnt offering, 
and the accompanying libation similarly. 

Num 28:1 1 ‘At the beginning of each of your months you will offer a burnt offering to Yahweh: two young bulls, 
one ram and seven yearling lambs, without blemish; 

Num 28:12 for each bull a cereal offering of three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil; for each ram, a 
cereal offering of two-tenths of fine flour mixed with oil; 

Num 28:13 for each lamb, a cereal offering of one-tenth of fine flour mixed with oil: as a burnt offering, as a 
pleasing smell, as food burnt for Yahweh. 

Num 28:14 The accompanying libations will be of half a hin of wine for a bull, one-third of a hin for a ram and 
one-quarter of a hin for a lamb. This will be the monthly burnt offering, month after month, every month of the 
year. 

Num 28:15 In addition to the perpetual burnt offering, a goat will be offered to Yahweh, as a sacrifice for sin, 
with its accompanying libation.

Num 30:1 Moses told the Israelites exactly what Yahweh had ordered him. 

Num 30:2 Moses spoke to the tribal leaders of the Israelites and said, This is what Yahweh has ordered: 

Num 30:3 ‘If a man makes a vow to Yahweh or a formal pledge under oath, he must not break his word: 
whatever he promises by word of mouth he must do. 



Num 30:4 ‘If a woman makes a vow to Yahweh or a formal pledge during her youth, while she is still in her 
father’s house, 

Num 30:5 and if her father hears about this vow or pledge made by her and says nothing to her, her vow, 
whatever it may be, will be binding, and the pledge she has taken, whatever it may be, will be binding. 

Num 30:6 But if her father on the day he learns of it expresses his disapproval of it, then none of the vows or 
pledges she has taken will be binding. Yahweh will not hold her to it, since her father has expressed his 
disapproval. 

Num 30:7 ‘If, being bound by vows or by a pledge voiced without due reflection, she then marries, 

Num 30:8 and if her husband hears of it but says nothing on the day he learns of it, her vows will be binding and 
the pledges she has taken will be binding. 

Num 30:9 But if on the day he learns of it he expresses his disapproval to her, this will annul the vow that she 
has made or the pledge that binds her, voiced without due reflection. Yahweh will not hold her to it. 

Num 30:10 ‘The vow of a widow or a divorced woman and all pledges taken by her are binding on her. 

Num 30:1 1 ‘If she has made a vow or taken a pledge under oath while in her husband’s house, 

Num 30:12 and if when the husband learns of it he says nothing to her and does not express disapproval to her, 
then the vow, whatever it is, will be binding, and the pledge, whatever it is, will be binding. 

Num 30:13 But if the husband when he hears of it annuls it on the day he learns of it, no undertaking of hers, be 
it vow or pledge, will be binding. Since the husband has annulled it, Yahweh will not hold her to it. 

Num 30:14 ‘Every vow or oath that is binding on the wife may be endorsed or annulled by the husband. 

Num 30:15 ‘If by the following day the husband has said nothing to her, it means that he endorses her vow, 
whatever it may be, or her pledge, whatever it may be. He endorses them if he says nothing on the day he 
learns of them. 

Num 30:16 But if, having learnt of them, he annuls them later, he will bear the consequences for his wife’s guilt’. 

i 

Num 30:17 Such were the laws which Yahweh prescribed to Moses, concerning the relationship between a man 
and his wife, and between a father and his daughter while still young and living in her father’s home. 

Num 31:1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, 

Num 31 :2 “Exact the full vengeance for the Israelites on the Midianites. Afterwards you will be gathered to your 
people”. 

Num 31 :3 Moses said to the people, “Some of you are to take up arms for Yahweh’s campaign against Midian, 
to carry out the vengeance of Yahweh on Midian. 

Num 31 :4 You will put a thousand men in the field from each of the tribes of Israel”. 

Num 31 :5 In this way Israel’s thousands provided twelve thousand men equipped for war, one thousand from 
each tribe: 

Num 31:6 Moses put them in the field, one thousand from each tribe, with Phinehas, son of the priest Eleazar, 
to go with them carrying the sacred objects and the trumpets for the battle cry. 

Num 31 :7 They made war on Midian, as Yahweh had ordered Moses, and put every male to death. 

Num 31 :8 What is more, they killed the kings of Midian, Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and Reba, the five Midianite kings; 
they also put Balaam son of Beor to the sword. 

Num 31 :9 The Israelites took the Midianite women and their little ones captive and carried off all their cattle, all 
their flocks and all their goods as booty. 

Num 31:10 They set fire to the towns where they lived and to all their encampments. 

Num 31:11 Then, taking all their booty, everything they had captured, human and animal, 

Num 31:12 they brought the captives, spoil and booty to Moses, the priest Eleazar and the whole community of 

Israelites at the camp on the Plains of Moab, near the Jordan by Jericho. 

Num 31:13 Moses, the priest Eleazar and all the leaders of the community went out of the camp to meet them. 
Num 31:14 Moses was enraged with the officers of the army, the commanders of the thousands and 
commanders of the hundreds, who had come back from this military expedition. 

Num 31:15 He said, “Why have you spared the life of all the women? 

Num 31:16 They were the very ones who, on Balaam’s advice, caused the Israelites to be unfaithful to Yahweh 
in the affair at Peor: hence the plague which struck Yahweh’s community. 

Num 31:17 So kill all the male children and kill all the women who have ever slept with a man; 

Num 31:18 but spare the lives of the young girls who have never slept with a man, and keep them for 

yourselves. 

Num 31:19 As for you, bivouac outside the camp for seven days, everyone who has killed anyone or touched a 
corpse. Purify yourselves and your prisoners on the third and seventh days, 

Num 31 :20 and purify all clothing, everything made of skin, everything woven of goat’s hair and everything 
made of wood”. 

Num 31 :21 The priest Eleazar said to the soldiers who had come back from the campaign, “This is an article of 



the Law which Yahweh prescribed to Moses: 

Num 31:22 although gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin and lead, 

Num 31:23 everything that can withstand fire can be cleaned by being passed through fire, it must still be 
purified with water for purification. Whatever cannot resist fire you must pass through water. 

Num 31 :24 “Wash your clothes on the seventh day and you will then be clean. You may then re-enter the camp”. 
Num 31:25 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: 

Num 31 :26 “With the priest Eleazar and the heads of families in the community, take a count of the spoils and 
captives, human and animal. 

Num 31 :27 You will then share out the spoil, half and half, between those who fought the campaign and the rest 
of the community. 

Num 31 :28 From the share of the combatants who took part in the campaign, you will set aside one out of every 
five hundred persons, oxen, donkeys and sheep as Yahweh’s portion. 

Num 31 :29 You will take this from the half share coming to them and give it to the priest Eleazar as the portion 
set aside for Yahweh. 

Num 31 :30 From the half coming to the Israelites, you will take one out of every fifty persons, oxen, donkeys, 
sheep, and all other animals, and give them to the Levites who are responsible for Yahweh’s Dwelling”. 

Num 31 :31 Moses and the priest Eleazar did as Yahweh had ordered Moses. 

Num 31:32 The spoils, the remainder of the booty captured by the soldiers, came to six hundred and seventy- 
five thousand sheep and goats, 

Num 31:33 seventy-two thousand head of cattle, 

Num 31:34 sixty-one thousand donkeys, 

Num 31 :35 and in persons, women who had never slept with a man, thirty-two thousand in all. 

Num 31:36 Half was assigned to those who had taken part in the war, namely three hundred and thirty-seven 
thousand five hundred sheep and goats, 

Num 31:37 of which Yahweh’s portion was six hundred and seventy-five, 

Num 31:38 thirty-six thousand head of cattle, of which Yahweh’s portion was seventy-two, 

Num 31:39 thirty thousand five hundred donkeys, of which Yahweh’s portion was sixty-one, 

Num 31:40 and sixteen thousand persons, of which Yahweh’s portion was thirty-two. 

Num 31 :41 Moses gave the priest Eleazar the portion set aside for Yahweh, as Yahweh had ordered Moses. 
Num 31 :42 As for the half coming to the Israelites which Moses had separated from that of the combatants, 

Num 31:43 this half, the community’s share, came to three hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred 
sheep and goats, 

Num 31:44 thirty-six thousand head of cattle, 

Num 31:45 thirty thousand five hundred donkeys 
Num 31:46 and sixteen thousand persons. 

Num 31:47 From this half, the Israelites’ share, Moses took one out of every fifty, human and animal, and gave 
them to the Levites who were responsible for Yahweh’s Dwelling, as Yahweh had ordered Moses. 

Num 31 :48 The officers of the thousands who had fought the campaign, the commanders of the thousands and 
commanders of the hundreds, came to Moses 

Num 31 :49 and said, “Your servants have numbered the soldiers under their command: none of our men is 
missing. 

Num 31 :50 So, as an offering for Yahweh, we have brought what each of us has found in the way of gold 
ornaments, armlets and bracelets, rings, earrings and breastplates, to make expiation for ourselves before 
Yahweh”. 

Num 31 :51 Moses and the priest Eleazar accepted this gold from them, all this jewellery. 

Num 31:52 This portion of gold given to Yahweh by the commanders of the thousands and commanders of the 
hundreds amounted to sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels. 

Num 31 :53 Each of the soldiers took his own booty. 

Num 31:54 But Moses and the priest Eleazar, having accepted the gold from the commanders of the thousands 
and commanders of the hundreds, brought it into the Tent of Meeting, to be a reminder of the Israelites before 
Yahweh. 

Num 32:1 Now, the Reubenites and Gadites owned very large herds of cattle. Having seen that the territories of 
Jazer and Gilead formed an ideal region for raising stock, 

Num 32:2 the Gadites and Reubenites went to Moses, the priest Eleazar and the leaders of the community, and 
said to them, 

Num 32:3 “The territory of Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo and Beon, 

Num 32:4 which Yahweh has conquered before the advancing community of Israel, is ideal land for raising 
stock, and your servants are cattle breeders. 

Num 32:5 So”, they said, “if you approve, give your servants this land for us to own; do not make us cross the 



Jordan”. 

Num 32:6 Moses said to the Gadites and Reubenites, “Do you intend your brothers to go into battle while you 
stay here? 

Num 32:7 Why are you discouraging the Israelites from crossing to the country which Yahweh has given them? 
Num 32:8 Your fathers behaved in the same way when I sent them from Kadesh-Barnea to see the country, 

Num 32:9 for, having gone as far as the Valley of Eshcol and seen the country, they discouraged the Israelites 
from entering the country which Yahweh had given them. 

Num 32:10 Hence Yahweh’s anger was aroused that day and he swore this oath, 

Num 32:1 1 ‘No man of twenty years and over, who left Egypt, shall set eyes on the country which I promised on 
oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob . . . , for they have not followed me absolutely, 

Num 32:12 except for Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua son of Nun: these indeed have 
followed Yahweh absolutely’. 

Num 32:13 Yahweh’s anger being aroused by Israel, he made them wander in the desert for forty years, until 
the generation that offended Yahweh had all disappeared. 

Num 32:14 And now you rise up in your father’s place, offshoot of sinful stock, to increase Yahweh’s burning 
anger with Israel even more! 

Num 32:15 If you turn away from him, he will prolong the time spent in the desert, and you will bring about this 
entire people’s ruin”. 

Num 32:16 They came to Moses and said, “We should like to build sheepfolds here for our flocks and towns for 
our little ones. 

Num 32:17 We ourselves will take up arms and lead the Israelites until we have brought them to the place 
appointed for them, while our little ones stay in the fortified towns to be safe from the local inhabitants. 

Num 32:18 We will not return to our homes until every one of the Israelites has taken possession of his heritage. 
Num 32:19 For we shall have no heritage with them on the other bank of the Jordan or beyond, since our 
heritage has fallen to us here, east of the Jordan”. 

Num 32:20 Moses said to them, “If you do as you have said, if you are prepared to fight before Yahweh, 

Num 32:21 and if all those of you who bear arms cross the Jordan before Yahweh, until he has driven all his 
enemies out before him, 

Num 32:22 then, once the country has become subject to Yahweh, you may go back, and will have discharged 
your obligation to Yahweh and Israel, and Yahweh will consider this territory yours. 

Num 32:23 But if you do not, you will sin against Yahweh, and be sure your sin will find you out. 

Num 32:24 Build towns, then, for your little ones and folds for your flocks; but do what you have promised”. 

Num 32:25 The Gadites and Reubenites said to Moses, “Your servants will do as my lord directs. 

Num 32:26 Our little ones, our wives, our flocks and all our livestock will stay in the towns of Gilead, 

Num 32:27 but your servants, each armed for war, will cross in Yahweh’s name and fight, as my lord says”. 

Num 32:28 So Moses gave orders about them to the priest Eleazar, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of 
families in the Israelite tribes. 

Num 32:29 Moses said to them, “If the Gadites and Reubenites, all those under arms, cross the Jordan with you 
to fight in Yahweh’s name, then, once the country has become subject to you, you will give them the territory of 
Gilead as theirs. 

Num 32:30 But if they will not cross with you under arms, they will receive their domains in Canaan with the rest 
of you”. 

Num 32:31 To this, the Gadites and Reubenites replied, “What Yahweh has said to your servants, we shall do. 
Num 32:32 Under arms, we shall cross in Yahweh’s name into Canaan, so that ownership of our heritage on 
this side of the Jordan will be ours”. 

Num 32:33 Moses then gave them — the Gadites, the Reubenites and the half-tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph 
— the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the country and the towns 
within its territory, and the country’s frontier-towns. 

Num 32:34 The Gadites rebuilt Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, 

Num 32:35 Atroth-Shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah, 

Num 32:36 Beth-Nimrah and Beth-Haran as fortified towns with folds for the flocks. 

Num 32:37 The Reubenites rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim, 

Num 32:38 Nebo and Baal-Meon (the names of which were altered), and Sibmah, giving new names to the 
towns which they rebuilt. 

Num 32:39 The descendants of Machir son of Manasseh went to Gilead. They conquered it and drove out the 
Amorites who were there. 

Num 32:40 Moses gave Gilead to Machir son of Manasseh, and he settled there. 

Num 32:41 Jair son of Manasseh went and seized their encampments, renaming them the Encampments of 
Jair. 



Num 32:42 Nobah went and seized Kenat with its dependent townships, and called it Nobah after himself. 

Num 33:1 These were the stages of the journey made by the Israelites when they left Egypt in their companies 
under the leadership of Moses and Aaron. 

Num 33:2 Moses recorded their starting-points in writing whenever they moved on at Yahweh’s order. The 
stages, from one starting-point to another, were as follows: 

Num 33:3 They left Rameses in the first month. It was the fifteenth day of the first month, the day following the 
Passover, when the Israelites confidently set out, under the eyes of all Egypt. 

Num 33:4 The Egyptians were burying those of their own people whom Yahweh had struck down, all the first- 
born; Yahweh had carried out his judgement on their gods. 

Num 33:5 The Israelites left Rameses and camped at Succoth. 

Num 33:6 Then they left Succoth and encamped at Etham which is on the edge of the desert. 

Num 33:7 They left Etham, turned back to Pi-Hahiroth, opposite Baal-Zephon, and encamped before Migdol. 
Num 33:8 They left Pi-Hahiroth, crossed the sea into the desert, and after marching for three days in the desert 
of Etham they encamped at Marah. 

Num 33:9 They left Marah and reached Elim. At Elim there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm 
trees; they encamped there. 

Num 33:10 They left Elim and encamped by the Sea of Reeds. 

Num 33:1 1 They left the Sea of Reeds and encamped in the desert of Sin. 

Num 33:12 They left the desert of Sin and encamped at Dophkah. 

Num 33:13 They left Dophkah and encamped at Alush. 

Num 33:14 They left Alush and encamped at Rephidim; the people found no drinking water there. 

Num 33:15 They left Rephidim and encamped in the desert of Sinai. 

Num 33:16 They left the desert of Sinai and encamped at Kibroth-ha-Taavah. 

Num 33:17 They left Kibroth-ha-Taavah and encamped at Hazeroth. 

Num 33:18 They left Hazeroth and encamped at Rithmah. 

Num 33:19 They left Rithmah and encamped at Rimmon-Perez. 

Num 33:20 They left Rimmon-Perez and encamped at Libnah. 

Num 33:21 They left Libnah and encamped at Rissah. 

Num 33:22 They left Rissah and encamped at Kehelathah. 

Num 33:23 They left Kehelathah and encamped at Mount Shepher. 

Num 33:24 They left Mount Shepher and encamped at Haradah. 

Num 33:25 They left Haradah and encamped at Makheloth. 

Num 33:26 They left Makheloth and encamped at Tahath. 

Num 33:27 They left Tahath and encamped at Terah. 

Num 33:28 They left Terah and encamped at Mithkah. 

Num 33:29 They left Mithkah and encamped at Hashmonah. 

Num 33:30 They left Hashmonah and encamped at Moseroth. 

Num 33:31 They left Moseroth and encamped at Bene-Jaakan. 

Num 33:32 They left Bene-Jaakan and encamped at Hor-Gidgad. 

Num 33:33 They left Hor-Gidgad and encamped at Jotbathah. 

Num 33:34 They left Jotbathah and encamped at Abronah. 

Num 33:35 They left Abronah and encamped at Ezion-Geber. 

Num 33:36 They left Ezion-Geber and encamped in the desert of Zin, that is, at Kadesh. 

Num 33:37 They left Kadesh and encamped at Mount Hor, on the borders of the land of Edom. 

Num 33:38 The priest Aaron went up Mount Hor on Yahweh’s orders and died there in the fortieth year of the 
exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, in the fifth month, on the first day of the month. 

Num 33:39 Aaron was a hundred and twenty-three years old when he died on Mount Hor. 

Num 33:40 The king of Arad, the Canaanite who lived in the Negeb of Canaan, heard of the Israelites’ arrival. 
Num 33:41 They left Mount Hor and encamped at Zalmonah. 

Num 33:42 They left Zalmonah and encamped at Punon. 

Num 33:43 They left Punon and encamped at Oboth. 

Num 33:44 They left Oboth and encamped in Moabite territory at lye-Abarim. 

Num 33:45 They left lyim and encamped at Dibon-Gad. 

Num 33:46 They left Dibon-Gad and encamped at Almon-Diblathaim. 

Num 33:47 They left Almon-Diblathaim and encamped in the Abarim mountains facing Nebo. 

Num 33:48 They left the Abarim mountains and encamped on the Plains of Moab, near the Jordan opposite 
Jericho. 

Num 33:49 They encamped near the Jordan between Beth-ha-Jeshimoth and Abel-ha-Shittim, on the Plains of 
Moab. 



Num 33:50 Yahweh spoke to Moses on the Plains of Moab, near the Jordan by Jericho, and said: 

Num 33:51 “Speak to the Israelites and say: ‘When you have crossed the Jordan into Canaan, 

Num 33:52 you will drive out all the local inhabitants before you. You will destroy all their painted images, you 
will destroy all their metal statues and you will demolish all their high places. 

Num 33:53 You will take possession of the country and settle in it, for I have given you the country as your 
property. 

Num 33:54 You will share it out by lot among your clans. To a large clan you will give a larger heritage, and to a 
smaller clan you will give a smaller heritage. Where the lot falls for each, that will be his. Your heritage will 
depend on the size of your tribe. 

Num 33:55 If, however, you do not drive out the local inhabitants before you, the ones you allow to remain will 
be thorns in your eyes and thistles in your sides and will harass you in the country where you are living, 

Num 33:56 and I shall treat you as I intended to treat them’”. 

Num 34:1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, 

Num 34:2 “Give the Israelites this order. Say: ‘When you enter the country (Canaan), this will be the country 
which forms your heritage. This is Canaan as defined by its boundaries: 

Num 34:3 ‘The southern part of your country will start from the desert of Zin, on the borders of Edom. Your 
southern boundary will start on the east at the end of the Salt Sea. 

Num 34:4 It will then turn south towards the Ascent of the Scorpions and go by Zin to end in the south at 
Kadesh-Barnea. It will then run towards Hazar-Addar and pass through Azmon. 

Num 34:5 From Azmon the boundary will turn towards the Torrent of Egypt and end at the Sea. 

Num 34:6 ‘Your seaboard will be on the Great Sea; this will be your western boundary. 

Num 34:7 ‘Your northern boundary will be as follows: you will draw a line from the Great Sea to Mount Hor, 
Num 34:8 then from Mount Hor you will draw a line to the Pass of Hamath, and the boundary will end at Zedad. 
Num 34:9 From there it will run on to Ziphron and end at Hazar-Enan. This will be your northern boundary. 

Num 34:10 ‘You will then draw your eastern boundary from Hazar-Enan to Shepham. 

Num 34:1 1 The boundary will run down from Shepham towards Riblah on the east side of Ain. Further down it 
will keep to the eastern shore of the Sea of Chinnereth. 

Num 34:12 The frontier will then follow the Jordan and end at the Salt Sea. ‘Such will be your country with the 
boundaries surrounding it’”. 

Num 34:13 Moses then gave the Israelites this order: “This is the country, where your heritages will be assigned 
by lot, and which Yahweh has ordered to be given to the nine tribes and the half-tribe, 

Num 34:14 for the tribe of the Reubenites with their families and the tribe of the Gadites with their families have 
already received their heritage; the half-tribe of Manasseh has also received its heritage. 

Num 34:15 These two tribes and the half-tribe have received their heritage on the other side of the Jordan by 
Jericho, to the east, towards the sunrise”. 

Num 34:16 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: 

Num 34:17 “Here are the names of the men who will divide the country up for you: the priest Eleazar and 
Joshua son of Nun, 

Num 34:18 and you will take one leader from each tribe to divide the country up into heritages. 

Num 34:19 Here are the names of these men: “For the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh; 

Num 34:20 “for the tribe of the Simeonites, Shemuel son of Ammihud; 

Num 34:21 “for the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad son of Chislon; 

Num 34:22 “for the tribe of the Danites, the leader Bukki son of Jogli; 

Num 34:23 “for the sons of Joseph: for the tribe of Manasseh, the leader Hanniel son of Ephod; 

Num 34:24 “for the tribe of the Ephraimites, the leader Kemuel son of Shiphtan; 

Num 34:25 “for the tribe of the Zebulunites, the leader Elizaphan son of Parnach; 

Num 34:26 “for the tribe of the Issacharites, the leader Paltiel son of Azzan; 

Num 34:27 “for the tribe of the Asherites, the leader Ahihud son of Shelomi; 

Num 34:28 “for the tribe of the Naphtalites, the leader Pedahel son of Ammihud”. 

Num 34:29 These were the men whom Yahweh ordered to divide Canaan into heritages for the Israelites. 

Num 35:1 Yahweh spoke to Moses on the Plains of Moab, near the Jordan by Jericho, and said: 

Num 35:2 “Order the Israelites, from the heritage they possess, to give the Levites towns in which to live and 
pasture land round the towns. You will give these to the Levites. 

Num 35:3 The towns must be their homes and the surrounding pasture land must be for their cattle, their 
possessions and all their animals. 

Num 35:4 The pasture land surrounding the towns which you give to the Levites will extend, from the walls of 
the towns, for a thousand cubits all round. 

Num 35:5 “Outside the town, measure two thousand cubits to the east, two thousand cubits to the south, two 
thousand cubits to the west and two thousand cubits to the north, the town lying in the centre; such will be the 



pasture lands of these towns. 

Num 35:6 The towns you give to the Levites will be six cities of refuge, ceded by you as sanctuary for those who 
commit manslaughter; and you will give forty-two towns in addition. 

Num 35:7 Altogether you will give the Levites forty-eight towns, with their pasture lands. 

Num 35:8 Of the towns which you give from the Israelites’ possessions, you will give more from those who have 
more, and less from those who have less. Each will give some of his towns to the Levites, in proportion to the 
heritage he himself has received”. 

Num 35:9 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: 

Num 35:10 “Speak to the Israelites and say: ‘Once you have crossed the Jordan into Canaan, 

Num 35:1 1 you will find towns, some of which you will make into cities of refuge where those who have 
accidentally committed manslaughter can take sanctuary. 

Num 35:12 These towns will afford you refuge from the avenger of blood, so that the killer will not be put to 
death before standing trial before the community. 

Num 35:13 Of the towns you give, six will serve you as cities of refuge: 

Num 35:14 as cities of refuge, you will give three towns on the other side of the Jordan and will give three towns 
in Canaan. 

Num 35:15 These six towns will serve as refuge for the Israelites, for the foreigner and for the resident alien, 
where anyone who has accidentally killed someöne can take sanctuary. 

Num 35:16 ‘But if he has struck the person with an iron object so as to cause death, he is a murderer. The 
murderer will be put to death. 

Num 35:17 If he has struck him with a stone meant for killing, and has killed him, he is a murderer. The 
murderer will be put to death. 

Num 35:18 Or if he has struck him with a wooden instrument meant for killing, and has killed him, he is a 
murderer. The murderer will be put to death. 

Num 35:19 The avenger of blood will put the murderer to death. Whenever he finds him, he will put him to 
death. 

Num 35:20 ‘If the killer has maliciously manhandled his victim, or thrown some lethal missile to strike him down, 
Num 35:21 or out of enmity dealt him the death-blow with his fist, then he who struck the blow will be put to 
death; he is a murderer; the avenger of blood will put him to death whenever he finds him. 

Num 35:22 If, however, he has manhandled his victim by chance, without malice, or thrown some missile at him 
not meaning to hit him 

Num 35:23 or, without seeing him, dropped on him a stone meant for killing and so killed him, so long as he 
bore him no malice and wished him no harm, 

Num 35:24 then the community will decide in accordance with these rules between the one who struck the blow 
and the avenger of blood, 

Num 35:25 and will save the killer from the clutches of the avenger of blood. They will send him back to the city 
of refuge where he had taken sanctuary, and there he will stay until the death of the high priest who has been 
anointed with the holy oil. 

Num 35:26 Should the killer leave the bounds of the city of refuge in which he has taken sanctuary 
Num 35:27 and the avenger of blood encounter him outside the bounds of his city of refuge, the avenger of 
blood may kill him without fear of reprisal; 

Num 35:28 since the killer should stay in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest; only after the death 
of the high priest is he free to go back to his own piece of property. 

Num 35:29 Such will be the legal rule for you and your descendants, wherever you may live. 

Num 35:30 ‘In any case of homicide, the evidence of witnesses will determine whether the killer must be put to 
death; but a single witness is not enough to sustain a capital charge. 

Num 35:31 You will not accept a ransom for the life of a murderer condemned to death; he must die. 

Num 35:32 Nor will you accept a ransom for anyone who, having taken sanctuary in his city or refuge, wishes to 
come back and live at home before the death of the high priest. 

Num 35:33 Do not profane the country you live in. Blood profanes the country and, for the country, the only 
expiation for the blood shed in it is the blood of the man who shed it. 

Num 35:34 So do not defile the country which you live in and where I live; for I, Yahweh, live among the 
Israelites’”. 

Num 36:1 Then the heads of families of the clan descended from Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, one 
of the clans descended from Joseph, came forward and, addressing Moses and the leaders, the Israelite heads 
of families, 

Num 36:2 they said: “Yahweh has ordered my lord to apportion the Israelites’ heritages in the country by lot and 
my lord has been ordered by Yahweh to give the heritage of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters. 

Num 36:3 Now, if they marry someöne from another Israelite tribe, their heritage will be alienated from our 



ancestral heritage. The heritage of the tribe to which they will then belong will be increased, and the heritage 
allotted to us will be diminished. 

Num 36:4 And when the jubilee for the Israelites comes round, these women’s heritage will become part of the 
heritage of the tribe to which they then belong, and be alienated from the heritage of our ancestral tribe”. 

Num 36:5 At Yahweh’s bidding, Moses gave the Israelites this order. He said: “What the Josephite tribe says is 
true. 

Num 36:6 This is Yahweh’s ruling for Zelophehad’s daughters: ‘They may marry whom they please, providing 
they marry into a clan of their father’s tribe. 

Num 36:7 But the heritages of Israelites are not to be transferred from tribe to tribe; each Israelite will stick to 
the heritage of his own tribe. 

Num 36:8 Any daughter who owns a heritage in an Israelite tribe will marry into a clan of her own paternal tribe, 
so that the Israelites may each preserve the heritage of his father. 

Num 36:9 No heritage may be transferred from one tribe to another; each Israelite tribe will stick to its own 
heritage’”. 

Num 36:10 Zelophehad’s daughters did as Yahweh had ordered Moses. 

Num 36:11 Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah and Noah, daughters of Zelophehad, married the sons of their 
father’s brothers. 

Num 36:12 Since they married into clans descended from Manasseh son of Joseph, their heritage reverted to 
the tribe of their father’s clan. 

Num 36:13 Such were the commandments and laws that Yahweh prescribed for the Israelites through Moses 
on the Plains of Moab near the Jordan by Jericho.
