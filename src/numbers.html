<h2 id="i">The Census (1:1–4:49)</h2>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses, in the desert of Sinai, in the Tent of Meeting, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after the exodus from Egypt, and said: </p>

<p>“Take a census of the whole community of Israelites by clans and families, taking a count of the names of all the males, head by head. You and Aaron will register all those in Israel, twenty years of age and over, fit to bear arms, company by company; you will have one man from each tribe, the head of his family, to help you.</p>

<h4>The census officials (1:5–19)</h4>

<p>“These are the names of those who must help you: </p>

<p>“For Reuben, Elizur son of Shedeur. </p>

<p>“For Simeon, Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai. </p>

<p>“For Judah, Nahshon son of Amminadab. </p>

<p>“For Issachar, Nethanel son of Zuar. </p>

<p>“For Zebulun, Eliab son of Helon. </p>

<p>“Of the sons of Joseph: for Ephraim, Elishama son of Ammihud; for Manasseh, Gamaliel son of Pedahzur. </p>

<p>“For Benjamin, Abidan son of Gideoni. </p>

<p>“For Dan, Ahiezerson of Ammishaddai. </p>

<p>“For Asher, Pagiel son of Ochran. </p>

<p>“For Gad, Eliasaph son of Reuel. </p>

<p>“For Naphtali, Ahira son of Enan”. </p>

<p>These were men of repute in the community; they were the leaders of their ancestral tribes, the heads of Israel’s thousands. </p>

<p>Moses and Aaron took these men who had been named and on the first day of the second month they mustered the whole community. The Israelites established their pedigrees by clans and families, and one by one the names of all men of twenty years and over were recorded. As Yahweh had ordered, Moses registered them in the desert of Sinai. </p>

<h4>The census (1:20–47)</h4>

<p>Once the pedigrees of the descendants of Reuben, Israel’s first-born, had been established by clans and families, the names of all the males of twenty years and over, fit to bear arms, were recorded one by one. The total of these for the tribe of Reuben was forty-six thousand five hundred. </p>

<p>Once the pedigrees of Simeon’s descendants had been established by clans and families, the names of all the males of twenty years and over, fit to bear arms, were recorded one by one. The total of these for the tribe of Simeon was fifty-nine thousand three hundred. </p>

<p>Once the pedigrees of Gad’s descendants had been established by clans and families, the names of all the males of twenty years and over, fit to bear arms, were recorded one by one. The total of these for the tribe of Gad was forty-five thousand six hundred and fifty. </p>

<p>Once the pedigrees of Judah’s descendants had been established by clans and families, the names of all the males of twenty years and over, fit to bear arms, were recorded one by one. The total of these for the tribe of Judah was seventy-four thousand six hundred. </p>

<p>Once the pedigrees of Issachar’s descendants had been established by clans and families, the names of all the males of twenty years and over, fit to bear arms, were recorded one by one. The total of these for the tribe of Issachar was fifty-four thousand four hundred. </p>

<p>Once the pedigrees of Zebulun’s descendants had been established by clans and families, the names of all the males of twenty years and over, fit to bear arms, were recorded one by one. The total of these for the tribe of Zebulun was fifty-seven thousand four hundred. </p>

<p>As regards the descendants of Joseph: once the pedigrees of Ephraim’s descendants had been established by clans and families, the names of all the males of twenty years and over, fit to bear arms, were recorded one by one. The total of these for the tribe of Ephraim was forty thousand five hundred. </p>

<p>Once the pedigrees of Manasseh’s descendants had been established by clans and families, the names of all the males of twenty years and over, fit to bear arms, were recorded one by one. The total of these for the tribe of Manasseh was thirty-two thousand two hundred. </p>

<p>Once the pedigrees of Benjamin’s descendants had been established by clans and families, the names of all the males of twenty years and over, fit to bear arms, were recorded one by one. The total of these for the tribe of Benjamin was thirty-five thousand four hundred. </p>

<p>Once the pedigrees of Dan’s descendants had been established by clans and families, the names of all the males of twenty years and over, fit to bear arms, were recorded one by one. The total of these for the tribe of Dan was sixty-two thousand seven hundred. </p>

<p>Once the pedigrees of Asher’s descendants had been established by clans and families, the names of all the males of twenty years and over, fit to bear arms, were recorded one by one. The total of these for the tribe of Asher was forty-one thousand five hundred. </p>

<p>Once the pedigrees of Naphtali’s descendants had been established by clans and families, the names of all the males of twenty years and over, fit to bear arms, were recorded one by one. The total of these for the tribe of Naphtali was fifty-three thousand four hundred. </p>

<p>Such were the men registered by Moses, Aaron and the leaders of Israel, of whom there were twelve, each representing his family. All the Israelites of twenty years and over, fit to bear arms, were counted by families. Altogether, the total came to six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty. </p>

<p>But the Levites and their tribes were not included in the count. </p>

<h4>Statute for the Levites (1:48–54)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Do not, however, take a census of the Levites, or register them with the other Israelites, but enrol the Levites to take charge of the Dwelling where the Testimony is and of all its furnishings and belongings. They must carry the Dwelling and all its furnishings; they must look after the Dwelling and pitch their camp around it. Whenever the Dwelling is moved, the Levites will dismantle it; whenever the Dwelling stops for the night, the Levites will erect it. Any unauthorised person coming near it will be put to death. The Israelites will pitch their tents, each in their own encampment and by their own standard, company by company, but the Levites will pitch their tents around the Dwelling where the Testimony is. In this way Retribution will be kept from falling on the whole community of Israelites, and the Levites will keep charge of the Dwelling of the Testimony”. </p>

<p>The Israelites did exactly as Yahweh had ordered Moses. They did as he said. </p>

<h4 id="ch2">Order of the tribes (2:1–34)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron and said: </p>

<p>“The Israelites must pitch their tents, each man by his own standard, under their family emblems. They must pitch their tents around the Dwelling where the Testimony is, some distance away. </p>

<p>“Encamped on the east side: </p>

<p>“Furthest towards the east, the standard of the camp of Judah, unit by 
unit. Leader of the Judahites: Nahshon son of Amminadab. His company: seventy-four thousand six hundred men. </p>

<p>“Next to him: </p>

<p>“The tribe of Issachar. Leader of the Issacharites: Nethanel son of Zuar. His company: fifty-four thousand four hundred men. </p>

<p>“The tribe of Zebulun. Leader of the Zebulunites: Eliab son of Helon. His company: fifty-seven thousand four hundred men. </p>

<p>“The tribal forces in the camp of Judah number in all a hundred and eighty-six thousand four hundred. These will be the first to break camp. </p>

<p>“On the south side, the standard of the camp of Reuben, unit by unit. Leader of the Reubenites: Elizur son of Shedeur. His company: forty-six thousand five hundred men. </p>

<p>“Next to him: </p>

<p>“The tribe of Simeon. Leader of the Simeonites: Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai. His company: fifty-nine thousand three hundred men. </p>

<p>“The tribe of Gad. Leader of the Gadites: Eliasaph son of Reuel. His company: forty-five thousand six hundred and fifty men. </p>

<p>“The tribal forces in the camp of Reuben number in all a hundred and fifty-one thousand four hundred and fifty. They will be second to break camp. </p>

<p>“Next, the Tent of Meeting will move, since the camp of the Levites is situated in the middle of the other camps. The order of movement will be the order of encampment, each man under his own standard. </p>

<p>“On the west side, the standard of the camp of Ephraim, unit by unit. Leader of the Ephraimites: Elishama son of Ammihud. His company: forty thousand five hundred men. </p>

<p>“Next to him: </p>

<p>“The tribe of Manasseh. Leader of the Manassehites: Gamaliel son of Pedahzur. His company: thirty-two thousand two hundred men. </p>

<p>“The tribe of Benjamin. Leader of the Benjaminites: Abidan son of Gideoni. His company: thirty-five thousand four hundred men. </p>

<p>“The tribal forces in the camp of Ephraim number in all a hundred and eight thousand one hundred. They will be third to break camp. </p>

<p>“On the north side, the standard of the camp of Dan, unit by unit. Leader of the Danites: Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai. His company: sixty-two thousand seven hundred men. </p>

<p>“Next to him: </p>

<p>“The tribe of Asher. Leader of the Asherites: Pagiel son of Ochran. His company: forty-one thousand five hundred men. </p>

<p>“The tribe of Naphtali. Leader of the Naphtalites: Ahira son of Enan. His company: fifty-three thousand four hundred men. </p>

<p>“The tribal forces in the camp of Dan number in all a hundred and fifty-seven thousand six hundred. They will be the last to break camp. </p>

<p>“All under their appropriate standards”. </p>

<p>Such was the tally of the Israelites when the census was taken by families. The full count of the entire camp, unit by unit, came to six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty. But, as Yahweh had ordered Moses, the Levites were not included in the census of the Israelites. </p>

<p>The Israelites did exactly as Yahweh had ordered Moses. This was how they pitched camp, grouped by standards. This was how they broke camp, each man in his own clan, each man with his own family. </p>

<h4 id="ch3">The tribe of Levi (3:1–51)</h4> 

<h5>a: The priests (3:1–4)</h5>

<p>These were the descendants of Aaron and Moses, at the time when Yahweh spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai. </p>

<p>These were the names of Aaron’s sons: Nadab the eldest, then Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. </p>

<p>Such were the names of Aaron’s sons, priests anointed and invested with the powers of the priesthood. Nadab and Abihu died in Yahweh’s presence, in the desert of Sinai, when they offered unauthorised fire before Yahweh. They left no children and so it fell to Eleazar and Ithamar to exercise the priesthood under their father Aaron. </p>

<h5>b: The Levites: their duties (3:5–10)</h5>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Muster the tribe of Levi and put it at the disposal of the priest Aaron: they must be at his service. They will undertake the duties incumbent on him and the whole community before the Tent of Meeting, in serving the Dwelling, and they will be in charge of all the furnishings of the Tent of Meeting and undertake the duties incumbent on the Israelites in serving the Dwelling. You will present the Levites to Aaron and his sons as men dedicated; they will be given to him by the Israelites. </p>

<p>“You will register Aaron and his sons, who will carry out their priestly duty. But any unauthorised person who comes near must be put to death”. </p>

<h5>c: Their privileged status (3:11–13)</h5>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Look, I myself have chosen the Levites from the Israelites instead of all the first-born, those who emerge first from the womb in Israel; the Levites therefore belong to me. For every first-born belongs to me. On the day when I struck down all the first-born in Egypt, I consecrated all the first-born in Israel, human and animal, to be my own. They are mine, Yahweh’s”. </p>

<h5>d: Census of the Levites (3:14–39)</h5>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai and said: </p>

<p>“You must take a census of Levi’s descendants by families and clans; all the males of the age of one month and over will be counted”. </p>

<p>At Yahweh’s word Moses took a census of them, as Yahweh had ordered. These were the names of Levi’s sons: Gershon, Kohath and Merari. </p>

<p>These were the names of Gershon’s sons by their clans: Libni and Shimei; Kohath’s sons by their clans: Amram, Izhar, Hebron and Uzziel; Merari’s sons by their clans: Mahli and Mushi. These were the clans of Levi, grouped by families. </p>

<p>From Gershon were descended the Libnite and Shimeite clans; these were the Gershonite clans. Their full number, counting the males of one month and over, came to seven thousand five hundred. The Gershonite clans pitched their camp behind the Dwelling, on the west side. The leader of the House of Gershon was Eliasaph son of Lael. As regards the Tent of Meeting, the Gershonites had charge of the Dwelling, the Tent and its covering, the screen for the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the curtaining of the court, the screen for the entrance to the court surrounding the Dwelling and the altar, and the cords required in dealing with all this. </p>

<p>From Kohath were descended the Amramite, Izharite, Hebronite and Uzzielite clans; these were the Kohathite clans. Their full number, counting the males of one month and over, came to eight thousand three hundred. They were in charge of the sanctuary. The Kohathite clans pitched their camp on the south side of the Dwelling. The leader of the house of the Kohathite clans was Elizaphan son of Uzziel. They were in charge of the ark, the table, the lamp-stand, the altars, the sacred vessels used in the liturgy, and the curtain with all its fittings. </p>

<p>The chief of the Levite leaders was Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest. He supervised the people responsible for the sanctuary. </p>

<p>From Merari were descended the Mahlite and Mushite clans; these were the Merarite clans. Their full number, counting the males of one month and over, came to six thousand two hundred. The leader of the House of the Merarite clans was Zuriel, son of Abihail. They pitched their camp on the north side of the Dwelling. The Merarites were in charge of the framework of the Dwelling, with its crossbars, poles, sockets and all its accessories and fittings, and also the poles around the court, with their sockets, pegs and cords. </p>

<p>Finally, on the east side, in front of the Dwelling, in front of the Tent of Meeting, towards the east, was the camp of Moses and Aaron and his sons, who had charge of the sanctuary on behalf of the Israelites. Any unauthorised person coming near was to be put to death. </p>

<p>The total number of male Levites of the age of one month and over, whom Moses counted by clans as Yahweh had ordered, came to twenty-two thousand. </p>

<h5>e: The Levites and the ransoming of the first-born (3:40–51)</h5>

<p>Yahweh said to Moses: </p>

<p>Take a census of all the first-born of the Israelites, all the males from the age of one month and over; take a census of them by name. You will then present the Levites to me, Yahweh, instead of Israel, and similarly the Levites’ cattle instead of the first-born cattle of the Israelites”. </p>

<p>As Yahweh ordered, Moses took a census of all the first-born of the Israelites. The total count, by name, of the first-born from the age of one month and over came to twenty-two thousand two hundred and seventy-three. </p>

<p>Yahweh then spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Take the Levites instead of all the first-born of the Israelites, and the Levites’ cattle instead of their cattle; the Levites will be mine, Yahweh’s. For the ransom of the two hundred and seventy-three first-born of the Israelites in excess of the number of Levites, you will take five shekels for each, by the sanctuary shekel, at twenty <i>gerah</i> to the shekel; you will then give this money to Aaron and his sons as the ransom for the extra number”. </p>

<p>Moses took the ransom money for the extra ones unransomed by the Levites; he took the money for the first-born of the Israelites: one thousand three hundred and sixty-five shekels, by the sanctuary shekel; and Moses then handed over their ransom money to Aaron and his sons, at Yahweh’s bidding, as 
Yahweh had ordered Moses. </p>

<h4 id="ch4">The Levite clans (4:1–33)</h4>

<h5>a: The Kohathites (4:1–20)</h5>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Take a census by clans and families of the Levites descended from Kohath: all the men between thirty and fifty years of age and eligible for military service, who will have their duties in the Tent of Meeting. </p>

<p>“These are the duties of the Kohathites: looking after those things that are especially holy. </p>

<p>“When camp is broken, Aaron and his sons must come and take down the screening curtain, and cover the ark of the Testimony with it. Over this, they will put a covering of fine leather, over which they will spread a cloth entirely of violet-purple. They will then fix the poles to the ark. </p>

<p>“Over the offertory table they will spread a violet cloth, and on it put the dishes, cups, bowls and libation jars; the bread of permanent offering will also be on it. Over these they will spread a scarlet cloth and cover the whole with a covering of fine leather. They will then fix the poles to the table. </p>

<p>“They will then take a violet cloth and cover the lamp-stand, its lamps, snuffers, trays and all the oil jars used for it, and will lay it and all its accessories in a covering of fine leather and put it on the litter. </p>

<p>“Over the golden altar they will spread a violet cloth, and cover that with a covering of fine leather. They will then fix the poles to it. </p>

<p>“They will then take all the other objects used in the service of the sanctuary, put them in a violet cloth, with a covering of fine leather, and put it all on the litter. </p>

<p>“When they have removed the ashes from the altar, they will spread a scarlet cloth over it, and on this place all the objects used in the liturgy, the fire pans, hooks, scoops, sprinkling basins and all the altar accessories. Over this they will spread a covering of fine leather. They will then fix the poles to it. </p>

<p>“Once Aaron and his sons have finished covering the holy things and all their accessories at the breaking of camp, the Kohathites will come and carry them, but without touching any of the holy things on pain of death. Such is the load for the Kohathites in the Tent of Meeting. But Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, is responsible for looking after the oil for the light, the fragrant incense, the daily cereal offering and the anointing oil, and for supervising the entire Dwelling and everything in it, the holy things and their accessories”. </p>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“You must not let the group of Kohathite clans be lost to the rest of the Levites. But deal with them in this way, so that they may survive and not incur death by approaching those things that are especially holy. Aaron and his sons will go in and assign to each of them his task and load, in such a way that they have no need to incur the death penalty by going in and setting eyes on the holy things, even for an instant”. </p>

<h5>b: The Gershonites (4:21–28)</h5>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Take a census of the Gershonites by families and clans, too: all the men between thirty and fifty years of age, eligible for military service, who will have their duties in the Tent of Meeting. </p>

<p>“These are the duties of the Gershonite clans, their functions and their loads. They will carry the curtaining of the Dwelling, the Tent of Meeting with its covering and the covering of fine leather that goes over it, the screen for the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the curtaining of the court, the screen for the entrance to the court surrounding the Dwelling and the altar, the cords, all the accessories for worship, and all the necessary equipment. </p>

<p>“They will be responsible for these things. All the duties of the Gershonites, their functions and their loads, will be carried out under the direction of Aaron and his sons: you will see that they fulfil their charge. Such are the duties of the Gershonite clans in the Tent of Meeting. Their work will be supervised by Ithamar, son of Aaron the priest. </p>

<h5>c: The Merarites (4:30–33)</h5>

<p>“You will take a census of the Merarites by clans and families. You will take a census of all the men between thirty and fifty years of age, eligible for military service, who will have their duties in the Tent of Meeting. </p>

<p>“The load they carry and the duties incumbent on them in the Tent of Meeting will be as follows: the framework of the Dwelling, its cross-bars, poles and sockets, the poles around the court with their sockets, pegs, cords and all their tackle. You will draw up a list of their names with the loads for which each is responsible. </p>

<p>“Such are the duties of the Merarite clans. All their duties in the Tent of Meeting will be supervised by Ithamar, son of Aaron the priest”. </p>

<h4>Curses of the Levites (4:34–49)</h4>

<p>Moses, Aaron and the leaders of the community took a census of the Kohathites by clans and families: all the men between thirty and fifty years of age, eligible for military service, for duties in the Tent of Meeting. The number of men counted in their clans came to two thousand seven hundred and fifty. Such was the total number of men in the Kohathite clans who were eligible for duties in the Tent of Meeting and whom Moses and Aaron counted at Yahweh’s bidding through Moses. </p>

<p>A census was taken of the Gershonites by clans and families: all the men between thirty and fifty years of age, eligible for military service, for duties in the Tent of Meeting. The number of men counted in their clans and families came to two thousand six hundred and thirty. Such was the total number of men in the Gershonite clans who were eligible for duties in the Tent of Meeting, and whom Moses and Aaron counted at Yahweh’s bidding. </p>

<p>A census was taken of the Merarite clans by clans and families: all the men between thirty and fifty years of age, eligible for military service, for duties in the Tent of Meeting. The number of men counted in their clans came to three thousand two hundred. Such was the total number of men in the Merarite clans, whom Moses and Aaron counted at Yahweh’s bidding through Moses. </p>

<p>The total number of Levites whom Moses, Aaron and the leaders of Israel counted in their clans and families, all the men between thirty and fifty years of age, eligible for religious duties and for those of transporting the Tent of Meeting came to eight thousand five hundred and eighty. At Yahweh’s bidding through Moses, a census was taken of them and each man was assigned his duty and load. And so the census was conducted by Moses as Yahweh had ordered him. </p>

<h2 id="ii">II: Various Laws (5:1–6:27)</h2>

<h4>Expulsion of the unclean (5:1–4)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Order the Israelites to expel from the camp all those suffering from a contagious skin-disease or from a discharge, or who have become unclean by touching a corpse. Whether man or woman, you will expel them; you will expel them from the camp, so that they do not pollute their encampments, in the heart of which I dwell”. </p>

<p>The Israelites did so: they expelled them from the camp. The Israelites did as Yahweh had told Moses. </p>

<h4>Restitution (5:5–10)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, “Speak to the Israelites: </p>

<p>‘If a man or woman commits any of the sins by which people break faith with 
Yahweh, that person incurs guilt. </p>

<p>‘The person must confess the sin committed and restore in full the amount owed, with one-fifth added. Payment is to be made to the person wronged. </p>

<p>‘If, however, the latter has no relation to whom restitution can be made, the restitution due to Yahweh reverts to the priest, apart from the ram of expiation with which the priest makes expiation for the guilty party. For of everything the Israelites consecrate and bring to the priest he has a right to the portion set aside. Whatever anyone consecrates is his own; whatever is given to the priest belongs to the priest’”. </p>

<h4>Cereal offering in cases of suspicion (5:11–31)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, “Speak to the Israelites and say: </p>

<p>‘If anyone has a wife who goes astray and is unfaithful to him, if some other man sleeps with the woman without the husband’s knowledge, and she secretly makes herself unclean, without any witness against her, and without anyone catching her in the act; if, then, a spirit of suspicion comes over the husband and makes him suspicious of the wife who has disgraced herself, or again if this spirit of suspicion comes over him and makes him suspicious of his wife even when she is innocent, the man will bring his wife before the priest, and on her behalf make an offering of one-tenth of an <i>ephah</i> of barley meal. He will not pour oil over it or put incense on it, because this is a cereal offering for a case of suspicion, a memorial offering to recall guilt to mind. </p>

<p>‘The priest will then bring the woman forward and place her before Yahweh. The priest will then take fresh water in an earthen jar, and on the water throw dust that he has taken from the floor of the Dwelling. After he has placed the woman before Yahweh, he will unbind her hair and put the commemorative cereal offering (that is, the cereal offering for a case of suspicion) into her hands. In his own hands the priest will hold the water of bitterness and cursing. </p>

<p>‘The priest will then put the woman on oath. He will say to her: If it is not true that a man has slept with you, that you have gone astray and made yourself unclean while under your husband’s authority, may this water of bitterness and cursing do you no harm. But if it is true that you have gone astray while under your husband’s authority, that you have made yourself unclean and that a man other than your husband has slept with you… Here the priest will impose an imprecatory oath on the woman. He will say to her: …May Yahweh make you the object of your people’s execration and curses, by making your sexual organs shrivel and your belly swell! May this water of cursing entering your bowels, make your belly swell and your sexual organs shrivel! To which the woman will reply: <i>Amen! Amen!</i> </p>

<p>‘Having written these curses on a scroll and washed them off in the water of bitterness, the priest will make the woman drink the water of bitterness and cursing; when the water of cursing enters into her, it will become bitter. </p>

<p>‘The priest will then take the cereal offering for a case of suspicion from the woman’s hands, and hold it up before Yahweh with a gesture of offering, and so carry it up to the altar. He will take a handful of it as a memorial and burn it on the altar. </p>

<p>‘After this, he will make the woman drink the water. After he has made her drink it, if it is true that she has made herself unclean and been unfaithful to her husband, the water of cursing then entering into her will indeed be bitter: her belly will swell and her sexual organs shrivel, and she will be an object of execration to her people. But if she has not made herself unclean, but is clean, then she will go unscathed and will bear children. </p>

<p>‘Such is the ritual in cases of suspicion, when a woman has gone astray and made herself unclean while under her husband’s authority, or when a spirit of suspicion has come over a man and made him suspicious of his wife. When a husband brings such a woman before Yahweh, the priest will apply this ritual to her in full. The husband will be guiltless, but the woman will bear the consequences of her guilt’”. </p>

<h4 id="ch6">The nazirite (6:1–21)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, “Speak to the Israelites and say: </p>

<p>‘If a man or a woman wishes to make a vow, the nazirite vow, to vow 
himself to Yahweh, he will abstain from wine and fermented liquor, he will not drink vinegar derived from one or the other, he will not drink grape-juice or eat grapes, be they fresh or dried. For the duration of his vow he will eat nothing that comes from the vine, not even juice of unripe grapes or skins of grapes. As long as he is bound by his vow, no razor will touch his head; until the time for which he has vowed himself to Yahweh is completed, he remains consecrated and will let his hair grow freely. For the entire period of his vow to Yahweh, he will not go near a corpse, he will not make himself unclean for his father or his mother, or his brother or his sister, should they die, since on his head he carries his vow to his God. Throughout the whole of his vow he is a person consecrated to Yahweh. </p>

<p>‘If anyone suddenly dies near him, making his vowed hair unclean, he will shave his head on the day he is purified, he will shave his head on the seventh day. On the eighth day, he will bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest, at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. The priest will offer one as a sacrifice for sin, and the other as a burnt offering and will then perform for the person the rite of expiation for the pollution which he has contracted from the corpse. He will consecrate his head that same day; he will vow himself to Yahweh for the period of his nazirate, and will bring a male yearling lamb as a sacrifice of reparation. The time already spent will not count, since his hair had become unclean. </p>

<p>‘This is the ritual for the nazirite on the day when the period of his vow is completed. He will be led to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting, bringing his offering to Yahweh: an unblemished male yearling lamb as a burnt offering, an unblemished yearling ewe lamb as a sacrifice for sin, an unblemished ram as a peace offering, and a basket of unleavened loaves made of fine flour mixed with oil, and of unleavened wafers spread with oil, with the cereal offerings and libations appropriate to them. The priest, having brought all this before Yahweh, will offer the nazirite’s sin sacrifice and burnt offering. The latter will then offer the ram as a communion sacrifice with the basket of unleavened bread, and the priest will offer the accompanying cereal offering and libation. The nazirite will then shave off his vowed hair at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and, taking the locks of his vowed head, he will put them in the fire of the communion sacrifice. The priest will take the shoulder of the ram, as soon as it is cooked, with an unleavened cake from the basket, and an unleavened wafer, and put them into the hands of the nazirite once he has shaved off his hair. With these he will make the gesture of offering before Yahweh; as it is a holy thing, it reverts to the priest, in addition to the forequarter that has been presented and the thigh that has been set aside. After this, the nazirite may drink wine. </p>

<p>‘Such is the ritual for the nazirite. If, besides his hair, he has also vowed a personal offering to Yahweh, he will (apart from anything else that his means allow) fulfil the vow that he has made, in addition to what the ritual prescribes for his hair’”. </p>

<h4>The form of blessing (6:22–27)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, “Speak to Aaron and his sons and say: </p>

<p>‘This is how you must bless the Israelites. You will say: </p>

<p>May Yahweh bless you and keep you.<br />
May Yahweh let his face shine on you and be gracious to you.<br />
May Yahweh show you his face and bring you peace’. </p>

<p>This is how they must call down my name on the Israelites, and then I shall bless them”. </p>

<h2 id="iii">III: Offerings of the Leaders and Consecration of the Levites (7:1–8:26)</h2>

<h4>Offering of wagons (7:1–9)</h4>

<p>On the day Moses finished erecting the Dwelling, he anointed and consecrated it and all its furniture, as well as the altar and all its equipment. When he had anointed and consecrated it all, the leaders of Israel made an offering; they were the heads of their families, the tribal leaders who had presided over the census. They brought their offering before Yahweh: six covered wagons and twelve oxen, one wagon for every two leaders and one ox each. They brought them in front of the Dwelling. Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, “Accept these from them, and let them be set apart for the service of the Tent of Meeting. You will give them to the Levites, to each as his duties require”. Moses took the wagons and oxen, and gave them to the Levites. To the Gershonites he gave two wagons and four oxen for the duties they had to perform. To the Merarites he gave four wagons and eight oxen for the duties they had to perform under the direction of Ithamar, son of Aaron the priest. But to the Kohathites he gave none at all, because the sacred charge entrusted to them had to be carried on their shoulders. </p>

<h4>Dedication offering (7:10–89)</h4>

<p>The leaders then made an offering for the dedication of the altar, on the day it was anointed. They brought their offering before the altar, and Yahweh said to Moses, “Each day one of the leaders must bring his offering for the dedication of the altar”. On the first day an offering was brought by Nahshon son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah. His offering consisted of: one silver bowl weighing a hundred and thirty shekels, one silver sprinkling bowl weighing seventy shekels (sanctuary shekels), both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil as a cereal offering, one golden bowl weighing ten shekels, full of incense, one young bull, one ram and one male yearling lamb as a burnt offering, one he-goat as a sacrifice for sin, and two bulls, five rams, five he-goats and five male yearling lambs as a communion sacrifice.

The sum total of animals for the communion sacrifice: twenty-four bulls, sixty rams, sixty he-goats and sixty male yearling lambs.

<p>When Moses went into the Tent of Meeting to speak with him, he heard the voice speaking to him from above the mercy-seat on the ark of the Testimony, from between the two great winged creatures. He then spoke to him. </p>

<h4 id="ch8">The lamps for the lamp-stand (8:1–4)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Speak to Aaron and say, ‘When you set up the lamps, the seven lamps must throw their light towards the front of the lamp-stand’”. </p>

<p>Aaron did this. He set up the lamps to the front of the lamp-stand, as Yahweh had ordered Moses. This lamp-stand was worked in beaten gold, including its stem and its petals, which were also of beaten gold. This lamp-stand had been made according to the pattern Yahweh had shown to Moses. </p>

<h4>The Levites are offered to Yahweh (8:5–22)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, “Separate the Levites from the Israelites and purify them. This is how you must purify them: you will sprinkle them with purifying water, and they will shave their bodies all over and wash their clothes. They will then be clean. They will then take a young bull, with the accompanying cereal offering of fine flour mixed with oil, and you will take a second young bull for a sacrifice for sin. You will then bring the Levites in front of the Tent of Meeting, and assemble the whole community of Israelites. Once you have brought the Levites before Yahweh, the Israelites will lay their hands on them. Aaron will then offer the Levites, making the gesture of offering before Yahweh on behalf of the Israelites, admitting them to Yahweh’s service. </p>

<p>“The Levites will then lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, one of which you will offer as a sacrifice for sin, and the other as a burnt offering to Yahweh, to perform the rite of expiation for the Levites. Having brought the Levites before Aaron and his sons, you will present them to Yahweh with the gesture of offering. That is how you will set the Levites apart from the Israelites, for them to be mine. The Levites will then begin their ministry in the Tent of Meeting. </p>

<p>“You will purify them and offer them with the gesture of offering because, of the Israelites, they have been dedicated to me in place of all those who first emerge from the womb, instead of the first-born; of all the Israelites, I have taken them for my own. For all the first-born of the Israelites, whether human or animal, do indeed belong to me: the day I struck down all the first-born in Egypt, I consecrated them to myself, and now, in place of all the first-born of the Israelites, I have taken the Levites. Of the Israelites, I give the Levites to Aaron and his sons, as dedicated men, to minister in the Tent of Meeting on behalf of the Israelites and perform the rite of expiation for them, so that no disaster befalls the Israelites when the Israelites come close to the sanctuary”. </p>

<p>Moses, Aaron and the whole community of Israelites dealt with the Levites exactly as Yahweh had ordered Moses concerning them; this is what the Israelites did with them. The Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes, and Aaron presented them with the gesture of offering before Yahweh. He then performed the rite of expiation for them to purify them. The Levites were then allowed to perform their ministry in the Tent of Meeting in the presence of Aaron and his sons. As Yahweh had ordered Moses concerning the Levites, so it was done with them. </p>

<h4>The duration of their ministry (8:23–26)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>This concerns the Levites. From the age of twenty-five onwards, the Levite will exercise his ministry and do duty in the Tent of Meeting. After the age of fifty, he is no longer bound to the ministry; he will have no further duties; but he will still help his brothers to assure the services in the Tent of Meeting, though he himself will no longer have any ministry. That is how you will act as regards the ministry of the Levites”. </p>

<h2 id="iv">IV: The Passover and the Departure (9:1–10:36)</h2>

<h4>Date of the Passover (9:1–5)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses, in the desert of Sinai, in the second year after the exodus from Egypt, in the first month, and said: </p>

<p>“The Israelites must keep the Passover at its appointed time. The fourteenth day of this month, at twilight, is the time appointed for you to keep it. You will keep it with all the laws and customs proper to it”. </p>

<p>Moses told the Israelites to keep the Passover. They kept it, in the desert of Sinai, in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at twilight. The Israelites did everything as Yahweh had ordered Moses. </p>

<h4>Individual cases (9:6–14)</h4>

<p>It happened that some men had become unclean by touching a dead body; they could not keep the Passover that day. They came the same day to Moses and Aaron, and said, “We have become unclean by touching a dead body. Why should we be excluded from bringing an offering to Yahweh at the proper time with the rest of the Israelites?”. </p>

<p>Moses replied, “Wait here until I hear what order Yahweh gives about you”. </p>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, “Speak to the Israelites and say: </p>

<p>‘Any of you or your descendants who becomes unclean by touching 
a dead body, or is away on a long journey, can still keep a Passover for Yahweh. Such persons will keep it in the second month, on the fourteenth day, at twilight. They will eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs; nothing of it must be left over until morning, nor will they break any of its bones. They will keep it, following the entire Passover ritual. But anyone who is clean, or who is not on a journey, but fails to keep the Passover, such a person will be outlawed from his people. For not having brought the offering to Yahweh at its appointed time, the person will bear the consequences of the sin. </p>

<p>‘A resident alien who keeps a Passover for Yahweh, will keep it in accordance with the ritual and customs of the Passover. You will have one law for alien and citizen alike’”. </p>

<h4>The cloud (9:15–23)</h4>

<p>On the day the Dwelling was erected, the cloud covered the Dwelling, the Tent of the Testimony. From nightfall until morning it remained over the Dwelling looking like fire. So the cloud covered it all the time, and at night it looked like fire. </p>

<p>Whenever the cloud rose from the Tent, the Israelites broke camp, and wherever the cloud halted, there the Israelites pitched camp. At Yahweh’s order, the Israelites set out and, at Yahweh’s order, the Israelites pitched camp. They remained in camp for as long as the cloud rested on the Dwelling. If the cloud stayed for many days on the Dwelling, the Israelites performed their duty to Yahweh and did not set out. But if the cloud happened to stay for only a few days on the Dwelling, just as they had pitched camp at Yahweh’s order, at Yahweh’s order they set out. If the cloud happened to remain only from evening to morning, they set out when it lifted the next morning. Or, if it stayed for a whole day and night, they set out only when it lifted. Sometimes it stayed there for two days, a month, or a longer time; however long the cloud rested on the Dwelling, the Israelites remained in camp, and when it lifted they set out. At Yahweh’s order they pitched camp, and at Yahweh’s order they set out. They performed their duty to Yahweh, as Yahweh had ordered through Moses. </p>

<h4 id="ch10">The trumpets (10:1–10)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Make yourself two trumpets; make them of beaten silver, so that you can use them for summoning the community, and for sounding the order to break camp. Whenever they are sounded, the whole community must gather around you, at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. But if only one trumpet is sounded, then only the leaders, the heads of Israel’s thousands, must gather around you. </p>

<p>“When the trumpet blast is accompanied by a battle cry, the encampments pitched to the east will set out. At the second blast accompanied by a battle cry, the encampments pitched to the south will set out. For breaking camp, the trumpet blast will be accompanied by a battle cry, but for assembling the community the trumpets will be sounded without battle cry. The Aaronite priests will sound the trumpets; this is a perpetual decree for you and your descendants. </p>

<p>“When in your country you go to war against an enemy who is oppressing you, you will sound trumpets with a battle cry, and Yahweh your God will remember you, and you will be delivered from your enemies. At your festivals, solemnities and new-moon feasts, you will sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings and communion sacrifices, so that they recall you to the remembrance of your God. I am Yahweh your God”. </p>

<h4>The order of march (10:11–28)</h4>

<p>In the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, the cloud rose from where the Dwelling of the Testimony was, and the Israelites set out, in marching order, from the desert of Sinai. The cloud came to rest in the desert of Paran. </p>

<p>These were the men who set out in the vanguard, at Yahweh’s order through Moses: first went the standard of the camp of the Judahites and their units, with Nahshon son of Amminadab commanding that contingent; Nethanel son of Zuar commanding the tribal contingent of the Issacharites; and Eliab son of Helon commanding the tribal contingent of the Zebulunites. </p>

<p>The Dwelling was then dismantled and the Gershonites and Merarites set out, carrying the Dwelling. </p>

<p>Then came the standard of the camp of the Reubenites and their units, with Elizur son of Shedeur commanding that contingent; Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai commanding the tribal contingent of the Simeonites; and Eliasaph son of Reuel commanding the tribal contingent of the Gadites. </p>

<p>Then came the Kohathites carrying the sanctuary (the Dwelling was erected before they arrived). </p>

<p>Then came the standard of the camp of the Ephraimites and their units, with Elishama son of Ammihud commanding that contingent; Gamaliel son of Pedahzur commanding the tribal contingent of the Manassehites; and Abidan son of Gideoni commanding the tribal contingent of the Benjaminites. </p>

<p>Last of all, the rearguard of all the camps, came the standard of the camp of the Danites and their units, with Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai commanding that contingent; Pagiel son of Ochran commanding the tribal contingent of the Asherites; and Ahira son of Enan commanding the tribal contingent of the Naphtalites. </p>

<p>Such was the order of march for the Israelites, unit by unit. So they set out. </p>

<h4>Moses proposal to Hobab (10:29–32)</h4>

<p>Moses said to Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, his father-in-law, “We are setting out for the country of which Yahweh has said: I shall give it to you. Come with us, and we will treat you well, for Yahweh has promised good things for Israel”. </p>

<p>“I will not come with you”, he replied, “but shall go to my own country and kin”. </p>

<p>“Do not leave us”, Moses said, “for you know where we can camp in the desert, and so you will be our eyes. If you come with us, we shall share with you whatever blessings Yahweh gives us”. </p>

<h4>The departure (10:33–36)</h4>

<p>They set out from Yahweh’s mountain and travelled for three days, while the ark of the covenant of Yahweh preceded them on the three-day journey, searching out a place for them to halt. </p>

<p>In the daytime, Yahweh’s cloud was over them, once they had broken camp. Whenever the ark set out, Moses would say: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>Rise, Yahweh, may your enemies be scattered</span><br />
<span class="i1">and those who hate you flee at your approach! </span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And when it halted, he would say: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>Come back, Yahweh,</span><br />
<span class="i1">to the countless thousands of Israel! </span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="v">V: The Halts in the Desert (11:1–14:45)</h2>

<h4>Taberah (11:1–3)</h4>

<p>Now the people began to complain, which was offensive to Yahweh’s ears. When Yahweh heard, his anger was aroused and the fire of Yahweh broke out among them; it devoured one end of the camp. The people appealed to Moses who interceded with Yahweh and the fire died down. So the place was called Taberah, because the fire of Yahweh had broken out among them. </p>

<h4>Kibroth-ha-Taavah. The people complain (11:4–9)</h4>

<p>The rabble who had joined the people were feeling the pangs of hunger, and the Israelites began to weep again. “Who will give us meat to eat?”, they said. “Think of the fish we used to eat free in Egypt, the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions and garlic! But now we are withering away; there is nothing wherever we look except this manna!”. </p>

<p>The manna was like coriander seed and had the appearance of bdellium. The people went around gathering it, and ground it in a mill or crushed it with a pestle; it was then cooked in a pot and made into pancakes. It tasted like cake made with oil. When the dew fell on the camp at night-time, the manna fell with it. </p>

<h4>The prayer of Moses (11:10–15)</h4>

<p>Moses heard the people weeping, each family at the door of its tent. Yahweh’s anger was greatly aroused; Moses too found it disgraceful, and he said to Yahweh: </p>

<p>“Why do you treat your servant so badly? In what respect have I failed to win your favour, for you to lay the burden of all these people on me? Was it I who conceived all these people, was I their father, for you to say to me, ‘Carry them in your arms, like a foster-father carrying an unweaned child, to the country which I swore to give their fathers’? Where am I to find meat to give all these people, pestering me with their tears and saying, ‘Give us meat to eat’?  I cannot carry all these people on my own; the weight is too much for me. If this is how you mean to treat me, please kill me outright! If only I could win your favour and be spared the sight of my misery!”. </p>

<h4>Yahweh replies (11:16–23)</h4>

<p>Yahweh said to Moses, “Collect me seventy of the elders of Israel, men you know to be the people’s elders and scribes. Bring them to the Tent of Meeting, and let them stand beside you there. I shall come down and talk to you there and shall take some of the spirit which is on you and put it on them. Then they will bear the burden of the people with you, and you will no longer have to bear it on your own. </p>

<p>“And say to the people, ‘Purify yourselves for tomorrow and you will have meat to eat, since you have wept in Yahweh’s hearing, saying: Who will give us meat to eat? How happy we were in Egypt! Very well, Yahweh will give you meat to eat. You will eat it not for one day, or two, or five, or ten or twenty, but for a whole month, until it comes out of your nostrils and sickens you, since you have rejected Yahweh who is among you, and have wept before him saying: Why did we ever leave Egypt?’”. </p>

<p>Moses said, “The people around me number six hundred thousand foot soldiers, and you say, ‘I shall give them meat to eat for a whole month’! If all the flocks and herds were slaughtered, would that be enough for them? If all the fish in the seas were collected, would that be enough for them?”. </p>

<p>Yahweh said to Moses, “Is the arm of Yahweh so short? You shall see whether the promise I have made to you comes true or not”. </p>

<h4>The spirit given to the elders (11:24–30)</h4>

<p>Moses went out and told the people what Yahweh had said. Then he collected seventy of the people’s elders and stationed them around the Tent. Yahweh descended in the cloud. He spoke to him and took some of the spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy elders. When the spirit came on them they prophesied — but only once. </p>

<p>Two men had stayed back in the camp; one was called Eldad and the other Medad. The spirit came down on them; though they had not gone to the Tent, their names were enrolled among the rest. These began to prophesy in the camp. A young man ran to tell Moses this. “Look”, he said, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp”. </p>

<p>Joshua son of Nun, who had served Moses since he was a boy, spoke up and said, “My lord Moses, stop them!”. </p>

<p>Moses replied, “Are you jealous on my account? If only all Yahweh’s people were prophets, and Yahweh had given them his spirit!”. Moses then went back to the camp with the elders of Israel. </p>

<h4>The quails (11:31–35)</h4>

<p>A wind, sent by Yahweh, started blowing from the sea bringing quails which it deposited on the camp. They lay for a distance of a day’s march either side of the camp, two cubits thick on the ground. The people were up all that day and night and all the next day collecting quails: the least gathered by anyone was ten <i>homer</i>; then they spread them out around the camp. The meat was still between their teeth, not even chewed, when Yahweh’s anger was aroused by the people. Yahweh struck them with a very great plague. </p>

<p>The name given to this place was Kibroth-ha-Taavah, because it was there that they buried the people who had indulged their greed. </p>

<p>From Kibroth-ha-Taavah the people set out for Hazeroth, and at Hazeroth they pitched camp. </p>

<h4 id="ch12">Miriam and Aaron critcise Moses (12:1–3)</h4>

<p>Miriam, and Aaron too, criticised Moses over the Cushite woman he had married. He had indeed married a Cushite woman. They said, “Is Moses the only one through whom Yahweh has spoken? Has he not spoken through us too?”. Yahweh heard this. Now Moses was extremely humble, the humblest man on earth. </p>

<h4>God’s answer (12:4–10)</h4>

<p>Suddenly Yahweh said to Moses, Aaron and Miriam, “Come out, all three of you, to the Tent of Meeting”. They went, all three of them, and Yahweh descended in a pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the Tent. He called Aaron and Miriam and they both came forward. Yahweh said: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>Listen to my words!</span><br />
<span class="i1">If there is a prophet among you,</span><br />
<span>I reveal myself to him in a vision,</span><br />
<span class="i1">I speak to him in a dream.</span><br />
<span>Not so with my servant Moses;</span><br />
<span class="i1">to him my whole household is entrusted;</span><br />
<span>to him I speak face to face,</span><br />
<span class="i1">plainly and not in riddles,</span><br />
<span class="i1">and he sees Yahweh’s form.</span><br />
<span>How, then, could you dare</span><br />
<span class="i1">to criticise my servant Moses? </span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yahweh’s anger was aroused by them. He went away, and as soon as the cloud left the Tent, there was Miriam covered with a virulent skin-disease, white as snow! Aaron turned to look at her and saw that she had contracted a virulent skin-disease. </p>

<h4>The prayer of Aaron and Moses (12:11–16)</h4>

<p>Aaron said to Moses: </p>

<p>“Oh, my Lord, please do not punish us for the sin we have been foolish 
enough to commit. Do not let her be like some monster with its flesh half eaten away when it leaves its mother’s womb!”.  </p>

<p>Moses pleaded with Yahweh. “O God”, he said, “I beg you, please heal her!”.  </p>

<p>Yahweh then said to Moses, “If her father had done no more than spit in her face, would she not be unclean for seven days? Have her shut out of the camp for seven days, and then have her brought in again”. </p>

<p>Miriam was shut out of the camp for seven days. The people did not set out until she returned. Then the people moved on from Hazeroth and pitched camp in the desert of Paran. </p>

<h4 id="ch13">The reconnaissance in Canaan (13:1–24)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, “Send out men, one from each tribe, to reconnoitre the land of Canaan which I am giving the Israelites. Each of them is to be a leading man of the tribe”. </p>

<p>At Yahweh’s order, Moses sent them from the desert of Paran. All of them were leading men of Israel. These were their names: </p>

<p>For the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zaccur:<br />
for the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori;<br />
for the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh;<br />
for the tribe of of Issachar, Igal son of Joseph;<br />
for the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea son of Nun;<br />
for the tribe of Benjamin, Palti son of Raphu;<br />
for the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel son of Sodi;<br />
for the tribe of Joseph, for the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi son of Susi;<br />
for the tribe of Dan, Ammiel son of Gemalli;<br />
for the tribe of Asher, Sethur son of Michael;<br />
for the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi son of Vophsi;<br />
for the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Machi. </p>

<p>Such were the names of the men whom Moses sent to reconnoitre the country. Moses then gave Hoshea son of Nun the name Joshua. </p>

<p>Moses sent them to reconnoitre the land of Canaan, “Go up into the Negeb”, he said, “then go up into the highlands. See what sort of country it is, and what sort of people the inhabitants are, whether they are strong or weak, few or many, what sort of land they live on, whether it is good or poor; what sort of towns they live in, whether they are open or fortified; what sort of land it is, fertile or barren, wooded or open. Be bold, and bring back some of the 
country’s produce”. </p>

<p>It was the season for early grapes. They went up and reconnoitred the country from the desert of Zin to Rehob, the Pass of Hamath. They went up by way of the Negeb as far as Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai and Talmai, the Anakim, lived. (Hebron was founded seven years before Tanis in Egypt.) Reaching the Vale of Eshcol, there they lopped off a vine branch with a cluster of grapes, which two of them carried away on a pole, as well as pomegranates and figs. This place was called the Vale of Eshcol after the cluster which the Israelites cut there. </p>

<h4>The expedition’s report (13:25–33)</h4>

<p>After forty days they returned from reconnoitring the country. Making their way to Moses, Aaron and the whole community of Israel, in the desert of Paran, at Kadesh, they made their report to them and the whole community, and displayed the country’s produce. </p>

<p>This was the report they gave: “We made our way into the country where you sent us. It does indeed flow with milk and honey; here is what it produces. At the same time, its inhabitants are a powerful people; the towns are fortified and very big; yes, and we saw the Anakim there. The Amalekites occupy the Negeb area, the Hittites, Jebusites and Amorites the highlands, and the Canaanites the sea coast and the banks of the Jordan”. </p>

<p>Caleb called the people around Moses to silence and then said, “We must march in immediately and take it; we are certainly able to conquer it”. </p>

<p>But the men who had been with him said, “We cannot attack these people; they are stronger than we are”. And they began disparaging to the Israelites the country they had reconnoitred, saying, “The country we have been to reconnoitre is a country that devours its inhabitants. All the people we saw there were of enormous size. We saw giants there too (the Anakim, descended from the Giants). We felt like grasshoppers, and so we seemed to them”. </p>

<h4 id="ch14">The rebellion of Israel (14:1–9)</h4>

<p>The whole community then cried out in dismay, and the people wept all that night. All the Israelites muttered at Moses and Aaron, and the whole community said to them, “Would to God we had died in Egypt, or even that we had died in this desert! Why has Yahweh brought us to this country, for us to perish by the sword and our wives and children to be seized as booty? Should we not do better to go back to Egypt?”. And they said to one another, “Let us appoint a leader and go back to Egypt”. </p>

<p>At this, Moses and Aaron threw themselves on their faces in front of the whole assembled community of Israelites, while Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, two of the men who had reconnoitred the country, tore their clothes and addressed the whole community of Israelites as follows, “The country we went to reconnoitre is a good country, an excellent country. If Yahweh is pleased with us, he will lead us into this country and give it to us. It is a country flowing with milk and honey. But do not rebel against Yahweh or be afraid of the people of the country, for we shall gobble them up. Their protecting shade has deserted them, while we have Yahweh on our side. Do not be afraid of them”. </p>

<h4>Yahweh’s anger. Moses intercedes (14:10–19)</h4>

<p>The whole community was talking of stoning them, when the glory of Yahweh appeared to all the Israelites, inside the Tent of Meeting, and Yahweh said to Moses: </p>

<p>“How much longer will these people treat me with contempt? How much longer will they refuse to trust me, in spite of all the signs I have displayed among them? I shall strike them with pestilence and disown them. And of you I shall make a new nation, greater and mightier than they are”. </p>

<p>Moses said to Yahweh: </p>

<p>“Suppose the Egyptians hear about this — for by your power you brought 
these people out of their country — and tell the people living in this country. They have heard that you, Yahweh, are with this people, and that you, Yahweh, show yourself to them face to face; that your cloud stands over them and that you go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. If you kill this people now as though it were one man, then the nations who have heard about you will say, ‘Yahweh was not able to bring this people into the country which he had sworn to give them, and so he has slaughtered them in the desert’. No, my Lord! Now is the time to assert your power as you promised when you said, earlier, ‘Yahweh, slow to anger and rich in faithful love, forgiving faults and transgression, and yet letting nothing go unchecked, punishing the parents’ guilt in the children to the third and fourth generation’. In your most faithful love, please forgive this people’s guilt, as you have done from Egypt until now”. </p>

<h4>Pardon and punishment (14:20–38)</h4>

<p>Yahweh said, “I forgive them as you ask. But — as I live, and as the glory of Yahweh fills the whole world — of all these people who have seen my glory and the signs that I worked in Egypt and in the desert, who have put me to the test ten times already and not obeyed my voice, not one shall see the country which I promised to give their ancestors. Not one of those who have treated me contemptuously will see it. However, since my servant Caleb is of another spirit and since he has obeyed me completely, I shall bring him into the country where he has been, and his descendants will own it (the Amalekites and Canaanites occupy the plain). Tomorrow you will turn about and go back into 
the desert, in the direction of the Sea of Suph”. </p>

<p>Yahweh then spoke to Moses and Aaron and said: </p>

<p>“How much longer am I to endure this perverse community muttering against me? I have heard what the Israelites mutter against me. Say to them, ‘As I live, Yahweh declares, I shall do to you what I have heard you saying. In this desert your dead bodies will fall, all you who were counted in the census, from the age of twenty years and over who have muttered against me. I swear none of you will enter the country where I swore most solemnly to settle you, except Caleb son of Jephunneh, and Joshua son of Nun. Your children, who you said would be seized as booty, will be the ones whom I shall bring in so that they get to know the country you disdained, but, as for you, your dead bodies will fall in this desert and your children will be nomads in the desert for forty years, bearing the consequences of your faithlessness, until the last one of you lies dead in the desert. For forty days you reconnoitred the country. Each day will count as a year: for forty years you will bear the consequences of your guilt and learn what it means to reject me’. I, Yahweh, have spoken: this is how I swear to treat this entire perverse community united against me. In this desert, to the last man, they shall die”. </p>

<p>The men whom Moses had sent to reconnoitre the country and who on their return had incited the whole community of Israel to mutter about him by disparaging it, these men who had disparaged the country were all struck dead before Yahweh. Of the men who had gone to reconnoitre the country, only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh were left alive. </p>

<h4>An abortive attempt by the Israelites (14:39–45)</h4>

<p>When Moses told all the Israelites what had been said, the people set up a great outcry. Early next morning they set out for the heights of the hill country saying, “Look, we will set out for the place about which Yahweh said that we have sinned”. </p>

<p>To which, Moses said, “Why disobey Yahweh’s order? No success will come of doing so. Do not go, for Yahweh is not among you, and you will be defeated by your enemies. For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are ahead of you, and you will be put to the sword, since you have turned away from Yahweh, and Yahweh is not with you”. All the same, they presumptuously set off for the heights of the hill country. Neither the ark of the covenant of Yahweh nor Moses left the camp. The Amalekites and Canaanites living in those highlands then came down, defeated them and harried them all the way to Hormah. </p>

<h2 id="vi">VI: Laws Governing Sacrifice.<br />
Powers of Priests and Levites (15:1–19:22)</h2>

<h4>Cereal offerings to accompany sacrifices (15:1–16)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, “Speak to the Israelites and say: </p>

<p>‘When you have arrived in the country where you are to live and 
which I am giving to you, and you burn food as an offering to Yahweh either as a burnt offering or as a sacrifice, whether in payment of a vow, or as a voluntary gift, or on the occasion of one of your solemn feasts, from your herds and flocks as a smell pleasing to Yahweh: the offerer will, as his personal gift to Yahweh, bring a cereal offering of one-tenth of an <i>ephah</i> of fine flour mixed with one-quarter of a <i>hin</i> of oil. You will also make a libation of wine, one-quarter of a <i>hin</i> to each lamb, in addition to the burnt offering or sacrifice. For a ram, you will make a cereal offering of two-tenths of an <i>ephah</i> of fine flour mixed with one-third of a <i>hin</i> of oil, and a libation of one-third of a <i>hin</i> of wine as a smell pleasing to Yahweh. If you offer a bull as a burnt offering or sacrifice, in payment of a vow or as a communion sacrifice for Yahweh, in addition to the animal you will offer a cereal offering of three-tenths of an <i>ephah</i> of fine flour mixed with half a <i>hin</i> of oil, and you will offer a libation of half a <i>hin</i> of wine, as food burnt as a smell pleasing to Yahweh. This will be done for every bull, every ram, every lamb or kid. Whatever the number of victims you intend to offer, you will do the same for each of them, however many there are. </p>

<p>‘Every citizen of the country will act in this way whenever he offers food burnt as a smell pleasing to Yahweh; and if an alien residing with you or with your descendants intends to offer food burnt as a smell pleasing to Yahweh, he will do as you do. There will be one law for you, members of the community, and the resident alien alike, a law binding your descendants for ever: before Yahweh you and the resident alien are no different. One law, one statute, will apply for you and the alien’”. </p>

<h4>The first-fruits of bread (15:17–21)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, “Speak to the Israelites and say: </p>

<p>‘When you have entered the country to which I am bringing you, you will set a portion aside for Yahweh when you eat that country’s bread. You will set one cake aside as the first-fruits of your dough; you will set this offering aside like the one set aside from your threshing. For all future generations you will set a portion of your dough aside for Yahweh. </p>

<h4>Expiation for faults of inadvertence (15:22–31)</h4>

<p>‘If through inadvertence you fail in any of these orders which Yahweh has given to Moses (whatever orders Yahweh has given you or your descendants through Moses, from the day when Yahweh gave his orders), this is what must be done: </p>

<p>‘If it is an inadvertence on the part of the community, the community as a whole will offer a young bull as a burnt offering, as a smell pleasing to Yahweh, with the prescribed accompanying cereal offering and libation, and a he-goat as a sacrifice for sin. The priest will perform the rite of expiation for the entire community of Israelites, and they will be forgiven, since it was an inadvertence. Once they have brought their offering as food burnt for Yahweh, and have presented their sacrifice for sin before Yahweh to make amends for their inadvertence, the whole community of Israelites will be forgiven, as also the alien residing with them, since the entire people acted by inadvertence. </p>

<p>‘If it is an individual who has sinned by inadvertence, he will offer a yearling kid as a sacrifice for sin. The priest will perform the rite of expiation before Yahweh for the person who has gone astray owing to this sin of inadvertence and, expiation having been made for him, he will be forgiven; whether he is an Israelite citizen or a resident alien, you will have one law for anyone who sins by inadvertence. </p>

<p>‘But the individual who acts deliberately, be he citizen or alien, commits an outrage against Yahweh, and such a man will be outlawed from his people. Since he has treated Yahweh’s word with contempt and has disobeyed his order, such a man will be outlawed absolutely and will bear the consequences of his guilt’”. </p>

<h4>Sabbath breaking (15:32–36)</h4>

<p>While the Israelites were in the desert, a man was caught gathering wood on the Sabbath day. Those who caught him gathering wood brought him before Moses, Aaron and the whole community. He was kept in custody, because the penalty he should undergo had not yet been fixed. Yahweh said to Moses, “This man must be put to death. The whole community will stone him outside the camp”. The whole community took him outside the camp and stoned him until he was dead, as Yahweh had ordered Moses. </p>

<h4>Tassels on clothes (15:37–41)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, “Speak to the Israelites and tell them, for all generations to come, to put tassels on the hems of their clothes and work a violet thread into the tassel at the hem. You will thus have a tassel, and the sight of it will remind you of all Yahweh’s orders and how you are to put them into practice, and not follow the dictates of your own heart and eyes, which have led you to be unfaithful. </p>

<p>“This will remind you of all my orders; put them into practice, and you will be consecrated to your God. I, Yahweh your God, have brought you out of Egypt, to be your God, I, Yahweh your God”. </p>

<h4 id="ch16">The rebellion of Korah, Dathan and Abiram (16:1–15)</h4>

<p>Now Korah son of Izhar, son of Kohath the Levite, and the Reubenites Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth were proud and rebelled against Moses with two hundred and fifty Israelites who were leaders of the community, prominent at the solemn feasts, men of repute. These banded together against Moses and Aaron and said to them, “You take too much on yourselves! The whole community, all its members, are consecrated, and Yahweh lives among them. Why set yourselves higher than Yahweh’s community?”. </p>

<p>On hearing this, Moses threw himself on his face. Then he said to Korah and all in his party, “Tomorrow morning Yahweh will reveal who is his, who the consecrated man whom he will allow to approach him. The one he allows to approach is the one whom he has chosen. This is what you must do: take the censers of Korah and all in his party, put fire in them and put incense in them before Yahweh tomorrow, and the one whom Yahweh chooses will be the consecrated man. Levites, you take too much on yourselves!”. </p>

<p>Moses then said to Korah, “Now listen, you Levites! Is it not enough for you that the God of Israel has singled you out of the community of Israel, and called you to be near him, to serve in Yahweh’s Dwelling and to represent the community by officiating on its behalf? He has called you to be near him, you and all your brother Levites with you, and now you want to be priests as well! For which reason, you and all in your party have banded together against Yahweh himself: for what is Aaron, that you should mutter against him?”. </p>

<p>Moses then summoned Dathan and Abiram sons of Eliab. They replied, “We will not come. Is it not enough for you to have brought us away from a country flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the desert, without your making yourself our absolute ruler? What is more, you have not brought us to a country flowing with milk and honey and you have not given us fields and vineyards for our heritage. Do you think you can hoodwink these people? We will not come”. </p>

<p>Moses flew into a rage and said to Yahweh, “Disregard their cereal offering! I have not taken so much as a donkey from them, nor have I wronged any of them”. </p>

<h4>The punishment (16:16–35)</h4>

<p>Moses said to Korah, “You and all your party, come before Yahweh tomorrow, you and they, and Aaron too. Each will take his censer, put incense in it, and bring his censer before Yahweh — two hundred and fifty censers. You and Aaron too will each bring his censer”. Each of them took his censer, put fire in it and placed incense on it, and stood at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting with Moses and Aaron. Then, Korah having assembled the whole community to confront them at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, the glory of Yahweh appeared to the whole community. </p>

<p>Yahweh then spoke to Moses and Aaron. He said, “Get away from this community. I am going to destroy them here and now”. </p>

<p>They threw themselves on their faces and cried out, “O God, God of the spirits that give life to every living thing, will you be angry with the whole community because one man has sinned?”. </p>

<p>Yahweh then said to Moses, “Speak to the community and say, ‘Stand well clear of Korah’s tent’”. </p>

<p>Moses stood up and went to Dathan and Abiram; the elders of Israel followed him. He spoke to the community and said, “Stand away, I tell you, from the tents of these sinners, and touch nothing that belongs to them, for fear that with all their sins you too will be swept away”. So they moved away from Korah’s tent. </p>

<p>Dathan and Abiram had come out and were standing at their tent doors, with their wives, their sons and their little ones. Moses said, “This is how you will know that Yahweh himself has sent me to perform all these tasks and that I am not doing them of my own accord. If these people die a natural death such as people commonly die, then Yahweh has not sent me. But if Yahweh does something utterly new, if the earth should open its mouth and swallow them and all their belongings, so that they go down alive to Sheol, then you will know that they held Yahweh in contempt”. </p>

<p>The moment he finished saying all this, the ground split apart under their feet, the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, their families, all Korah’s people and all their property. </p>

<p>They went down alive to Sheol with all their belongings. The earth closed over them and they disappeared in the middle of the community. At their cries, all the Israelites around them took to their heels, saying, “We do not want the earth to swallow us too!”.  </p>

<p>Fire then shot out from Yahweh and consumed the two hundred and fifty men offering incense. </p>

<h4 id="ch17">The censers (17:1–5)</h4>

<p>Yahweh then spoke to Moses and said, “Tell Eleazar son of Aaron the priest to pick the censers out of the smouldering remains and scatter the fire from them away from here, for these sinful censers have become sanctified at the price of human lives. Since they were brought before Yahweh and thus became consecrated, they must be hammered into sheets to cover the altar. They will be an object-lesson to the Israelites”. </p>

<p>The priest Eleazar took the bronze censers which had been carried by the men destroyed by the fire. They were hammered into sheets to cover the altar. They are a reminder to the Israelites that no unauthorised person, no one not of Aaron’s line, may approach and offer incense before Yahweh, on pain of suffering the fate of Korah and his party, as Yahweh had said through Moses. </p>

<h4>Aaron intercedes (17:6–15)</h4>

<p>On the following day, the whole community of Israelites were muttering against Moses and Aaron and saying, “You are responsible for killing Yahweh’s people!”.  Now, as the community was banding together against Moses and Aaron, they turned towards the Tent of Meeting, and there was the cloud covering it, and the glory of Yahweh appeared. Moses and Aaron then went to the front of the Tent of Meeting. 
</p>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, “Get away from this community. I am going to destroy them here and now”. They threw themselves on their faces. </p>

<p>Moses then said to Aaron, “Take a censer, put fire in it from the altar, place incense on it and hurry to the community to perform the rite of expiation for them: for retribution has come from Yahweh, plague has broken out”. Aaron took it as Moses said and ran into the middle of the community, but plague had already broken out among the people. He put in the incense and performed the rite of expiation for the people. Then he stood between the living and the dead, and the plague stopped. There were fourteen thousand seven hundred victims of the plague, apart from those who died because of Korah. Aaron then went back to Moses at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting; the plague had been halted. 
</p>

<h4>Aaron’s branch (17:17–26)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, “Tell the Israelites to give you a branch for each of their families, one for each leader of each family: twelve branches. Write the name of each on his branch; and on the branch of Levi write Aaron’s name, since the head of the Levite families must have a branch too. You will then put them inside the Tent of Meeting in front of the Testimony, where I make myself known to you. The man whose branch sprouts will be the one I have chosen; this is how I shall put an end to the mutterings of the Israelites about you”. </p>

<p>Moses spoke to the Israelites, and all their leaders gave him one branch each, twelve branches in all for their families; Aaron’s branch was among them. Moses placed them before Yahweh in the Tent of the Testimony. On the following day Moses went to the Tent of the Testimony and there, already sprouting, was Aaron’s branch, representing the House of Levi; buds had formed, flowers had bloomed and almonds had already ripened. Moses then brought out all the branches from before Yahweh to all the Israelites; they examined them and each one took back his own branch. </p>

<p>Yahweh then said to Moses, “Put Aaron’s branch back in front of the Testimony, where it will have its ritual place as a warning to the rebellious; thus you will rid me of their muttering for good, without their incurring death”. Moses did as Yahweh had ordered. That is what he did. </p>

<h4>Expiation: the function of the priesthood (17:27–18:7)</h4>

<p>The Israelites then said to Moses, “We are lost! We are dead men! We are all dead men! Anyone who approaches Yahweh’s Dwelling with an offering will die. Are we to be doomed to the last man?”. </p>

<p id="ch18">Yahweh then said to Aaron: </p>

<p>“You, your sons and your ancestor’s line with you will be answerable for 
offences against the sanctuary. You and your sons with you will be answerable for the offences of your priesthood. You will admit your brothers of the branch of Levi, your ancestor’s tribe, to join you and serve you, yourself and your sons, before the Tent of the Testimony. They must be at your service and the service of the whole Tent. Provided they do not come near the sacred vessels or the altar, they will be in no more danger of death than you. They must join you, they must take charge of the Tent of Meeting for the entire ministry of the Tent, and no unauthorised person will come near you. You will take charge of the sanctuary and charge of the altar, and retribution will never again befall the Israelites. Of the Israelites, I myself have chosen your brothers the Levites as a gift to you. As men dedicated, they will belong to Yahweh, to serve at the Tent of Meeting. You and your sons will undertake the priestly duties in all that concerns the altar and all that lies behind the curtain. You will perform the liturgy, the duties of which I entrust to your priesthood. But an unauthorised person approaching will incur death”. </p>

<h4>The priests’ portion (18:8–19)</h4>

<p>Yahweh said to Aaron: </p>

<p>“I myself have put you in charge of everything set aside for me. Everything consecrated by the Israelites I give to you and your sons as your portion by perpetual decree. Of the things especially holy, of the food offered, this is what will revert to you: every offering that the Israelites give back to me, whether it be a cereal offering, a sacrifice for sin or a sacrifice of reparation, is a thing especially holy and will revert to you and your sons. You will eat the things especially holy. Every male may eat them. You will regard them as sacred. </p>

<p>“To you will revert also whatever is set aside from the offerings of the Israelites, whatever is held out with the gesture of offering; this I give to you and your sons and daughters, by perpetual decree. All members of your household may eat it unless they are unclean. All the best of the oil, all the best of the new wine and wheat, these first-fruits offered by them to Yahweh I give to you. All the first produce of the country brought by them to Yahweh will revert to you. All members of your household may eat it unless they are unclean. Everything in Israel put under the curse of destruction will revert to you. Every first-born of all creatures brought to Yahweh, human or animal, will revert to you, but you will have to redeem the first-born of man; you will also redeem the first-born of an unclean animal. You will redeem it in the month in which it is born, valuing it at five shekels, at the sanctuary shekel, which is twenty <i>gerah</i>. But you will not redeem the first-born of cow, sheep and goat. They are holy: you will sprinkle their blood on the altar and burn the fat as food burnt to be a smell pleasing to Yahweh; the meat will revert to you, as will the forequarter that has been presented with the gesture of offering, and the right thigh. Everything the Israelites set aside for Yahweh from the holy things, I give to you and your sons and daughters, by perpetual decree. This is a covenant of salt for ever before Yahweh, for you and your descendants too”. </p>

<h4>The Levites’ portion (18:20–24)</h4>

<p>Yahweh said to Aaron: </p>

<p>“You will have no heritage in their country, you will not have a portion like them; I shall be your portion and your heritage among the Israelites. </p>

<p>“Look, as heritage I give the Levites all the tithes collected in Israel, in return for their services, for the ministry they render in the Tent of Meeting. The Israelites will no longer approach the Tent of Meeting, on pain of committing a deadly sin. Levi will discharge the duties of the Tent of Meeting, and the Levites will bear the consequences of their own guilt. This is a perpetual decree binding all your descendants: the Levites will have no heritage among the Israelites, for the tithe which the Israelites set aside for Yahweh is the heritage I have given the Levites. This is why I have told them that they will have no heritage among the Israelites”. </p>

<h4>Tithes (18:25–32)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, “Speak to the Levites and say: </p>

<p>‘When from the Israelites you receive the tithe which I have given you from them as your heritage, you will set a portion of this aside for Yahweh: a tithe of the tithe. It will take the place of the portion set aside that is due from you, like the wheat from the threshing-floor and new wine from the press. Thus you too will set a portion aside for Yahweh out of all the tithes you receive from the Israelites. You will give what you have set aside for Yahweh to the priest Aaron. Out of all the gifts you receive, you will set a portion aside for Yahweh. Out of all these things, you will set aside the best, the sacred portion’. </p>

<p>“You will say to them, ‘After you have set the best aside, the remainder will take the place, in the Levites’ case, of the produce of the threshing-floor and wine-press. You may consume this anywhere, you and the members of your households; this is your recompense for serving in the Tent of Meeting, and you will not incur sin by doing so, once you have set aside the best; you will not be profaning the things consecrated by the Israelites and will not incur death’”. </p>

<h4 id="ch19">The ashes of the red heifer (19:1–10)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron and said: </p>

<p>“This is a decree of the Law which Yahweh has prescribed. Tell the Israelites, they are to bring you a red heifer without fault or blemish that has never borne the yoke. You will give it to the priest Eleazar. It will then be taken outside the camp and slaughtered in his presence. The priest Eleazar will then take some of the victim’s blood on his finger, and sprinkle this blood seven times towards the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. The heifer will then be burnt while he looks on; its hide, flesh, blood and offal will be burnt. The priest will then take some cedar wood, hyssop and scarlet material and throw them on the fire where the heifer is burning. He will then wash his clothes and bathe himself; after which he will go back to the camp, though he will remain unclean until evening. The man who has burnt the heifer will wash his clothes and bathe himself and will remain unclean until evening. The man who gathers up the ashes of the heifer must be ritually clean; he will deposit them outside the camp, in a clean place. They will be kept for the ritual use of the Israelite community for making water for purification; it is a sacrifice for sin. The man who has gathered up the ashes of the heifer will wash his clothes and remain unclean until evening. For the Israelites as for the resident alien, this will be a perpetual decree. </p>

<h4>Cases of uncleanness (19:11–16)</h4>

<p>“Anyone who touches the corpse of anyone whatever will be unclean for seven days. Such a person must be purified with these waters on the third and seventh day and will then be clean; otherwise he will not be clean. Anyone who touches the corpse of anyone who has died and is not purified, defiles Yahweh’s Dwelling; such a person will be outlawed from Israel, since the water for purification has not been sprinkled over him; he is unclean, and his uncleanness remains in him. </p>

<p>“This is the law when someöne dies in a tent. Anyone who goes into the tent, or anyone who is already in it, will be unclean for seven days, and every open vessel with no cover tied over it will also be unclean. </p>

<p>“Anyone in the open country who touches a murder victim, a corpse, human bones or a grave will be unclean for seven days. </p>

<h4>The ritual of water for purification (19:17–22)</h4>

<p>“For someöne thus unclean, some of the ashes of the victim burnt as a sacrifice for sin will be taken and spring water must be poured over them, in a vessel. Someöne who is ritually clean will then take some hyssop and dip it in the water. This person will then sprinkle the tent, all the vessels and people who were there, and similarly anyone who has touched human bones, a murder victim, a corpse or a grave. On the third and the seventh day the clean one will sprinkle the unclean, who on the seventh day will be clean. The latter will then wash his clothes and bathe in water, and in the evening he will be clean. Anyone who fails to be purified in this way will be outlawed from the community, and would defile Yahweh’s sanctuary. Such a person is unclean, not having been sprinkled with the water for purification. </p>

<p>“This will be a perpetual decree for them. The person who sprinkles the water for purification will wash his clothes, and anyone who touches the water for purification will be unclean until evening. Anything that an unclean person touches will be unclean, and anyone who touches it will be unclean until evening”. </p>

<h2 id="vii">VII: From Kadesh to Moab (20:1–25:18)</h2>

<h4>The waters of Meribah (20:1–11)</h4>

<p>The Israelites, the whole community, arrived in the first month at the desert of Zin. The people settled at Kadesh. There Miriam died and was buried. </p>

<p>There was no water for the community, so they banded together against Moses and Aaron. The people laid the blame on Moses. “We would rather have died”, they said, “as our brothers died before Yahweh! Why have you brought Yahweh’s community into this desert, for us and our livestock to die here? Why did you lead us out of Egypt, only to bring us to this wretched place? It is a place unfit for sowing, it has no figs, no vines, no pomegranates, and there is not even water to drink!”. </p>

<p>Leaving the assembly, Moses and Aaron went to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. They threw themselves on their faces, and the glory of Yahweh appeared to them. Yahweh then spoke to Moses and said, “Take the branch and call the community together, you and your brother Aaron. Then, in full view of them, order this rock to release its water. You will release water from the rock for them and provide drink for the community and their livestock”. </p>

<p>Moses took up the branch from before Yahweh, as he had directed him. Moses and Aaron then called the assembly together in front of the rock. He then said to them, “Listen now, you rebels. Shall we make water gush from this rock for you?”. Moses then raised his hand and struck the rock twice with the branch; water gushed out in abundance, and the community and their livestock drank. </p>

<h4>The punishment of Moses and Aaron (20:12–13)</h4>

<p>Yahweh then said to Moses and Aaron, “Because you did not believe that I could assert my holiness before the Israelites’ eyes, you will not lead this assembly into the country which I am giving them”. </p>

<p>These were the Waters of Meribah, where the Israelites laid the blame on Yahweh and where, by their means, he asserted his holiness. </p>

<h4>Edom refuses right of way (20:14–21)</h4>

<p>Moses sent messengers from Kadesh: “To the king of Edom. Your brother Israel says this: You are aware of the great hardships we have encountered. Our ancestors went down to Egypt and there we stayed for a long time. But the Egyptians treated us badly, as they had our ancestors. When we appealed to Yahweh, he heard our cry and, sending an angel, brought us out of Egypt, and here we are, now, at Kadesh, a town on the borders of your territory. We ask permission to pass through your country. We shall not go through the fields or vineyards; we shall not drink the water from the wells; we shall keep to the king’s highway without turning to right or left until we have passed through your territory”. </p>

<p>To which, Edom replied, “You will not pass through my country; if you do, I shall oppose you by force of arms”. </p>

<p>To which the Israelites replied, “We shall keep to the high road; if I and my flocks drink any of your water, I am willing to pay for it. All I am asking is to pass through on foot”. </p>

<p>Edom replied: “You shall not pass”, and Edom opposed them in great numbers and great force. At Edom’s refusal to grant Israel passage through his territory, Israel turned away. </p>

<h4>The death of Aaron (20:22–29)</h4>

<p>They set out from Kadesh, and the Israelites, the whole community, came to Mount Hor. Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron at Mount Hor, on the frontier of Edom, and said, “Aaron is to be gathered to his people; he will not enter the country which I have given to the Israelites, since you both disobeyed my order at the Waters of Meribah. Take Aaron and his son Eleazar and bring them up Mount Hor. Then take Aaron’s robes off him and dress his son Eleazar in them. Aaron will then be gathered to his people; that is where he will die”. </p>

<p>Moses did as Yahweh ordered. With the whole community watching, they went up Mount Hor. Moses took Aaron’s robes off him and dressed his son Eleazar in them, and there Aaron died, on the mountain-top. Moses and Eleazar then came back down the mountain. The whole community saw that Aaron had died, and for thirty days the whole House of Israel mourned for Aaron. </p>

<h4 id="ch21">The capture of Hormah (21:1–3)</h4>

<p>The king of Arad, the Canaanite living in the Negeb, learned that Israel was coming by way of Atharim. He attacked Israel and took some prisoners. Israel then made this vow to Yahweh, “If you deliver this people into my power, I shall curse their towns with destruction”. Yahweh heard Israel’s words and delivered the Canaanites into their power, and they destroyed them in accordance with their curse. Hence the place was given the name Hormah. </p>

<h4>The bronze serpent (21:4–9)</h4>

<p>They left Mount Hor by the road to the Sea of Suph, to skirt around Edom. On the way the people lost patience. They spoke against God and against Moses, “Why did you bring us out of Egypt to die in the desert? For there is neither food nor water here; we are sick of this meagre diet”. </p>

<p>At this, God sent fiery serpents among the people; their bite brought death to many in Israel. The people came and said to Moses, “We have sinned by speaking against Yahweh and against you. Intercede for us with Yahweh to save us from these serpents”. </p>

<p>Moses interceded for the people, and Yahweh replied, “Make a fiery serpent and raise it as a standard. Anyone who is bitten and looks at it will survive”. Moses then made a serpent out of bronze and raised it as a standard, and anyone who was bitten by a serpent and looked at the bronze serpent survived. </p>

<h4>By stages to Transjordan (12:10–20)</h4>

<p>The Israelites set out and camped at Oboth. Then they left Oboth and camped at lye-Abarim, in the desert on the eastern border of Moab. They set out from there and camped in the gorge of the Zered. They set out from there and camped on the other side of the Arnon. </p>

<p>This gorge in the desert begins in the territory of the Amorites. For the Arnon is the frontier of Moab, between the Moabites and the Amorites. That is why it says in the Book of the Wars of Yahweh: </p>

<p>“…Waheb near Suphah and the gorges of the Arnon and the slope of the ravine running down to the site of Ar and over against the frontier of Moab”. </p>

<p>And from there they went to Beer, that being the well in connection with which Yahweh had said to Moses, “Call the people together and I will give them water”. </p>

<p>Then it was that Israel sang this song: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>Spring up, well!</span><br />
<span>Sing out for the well,</span><br />
<span>sunk by the princes,</span><br />
<span>dug by the people’s leaders</span><br />
<span>with the sceptre, with their staves! </span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>— and from the desert to Mattanah, and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth, and from Bamoth to the valley that opens into the country of Moab, towards the heights of Pisgah overlooking the desert. </p>

<h4>The conquest of Transjordan (21:21–22:1)</h4>

<p>Israel sent messengers to say to Sihon king of the Amorites, “I wish to pass through your country. We shall not stray into the fields or vineyards; we shall not drink the water from the wells; we shall keep to the king’s highway until we have passed through your territory”. </p>

<p>But Sihon would not give Israel leave to pass through his country. He assembled all his people, marched into the desert to meet Israel, and reached Jahaz, where he gave battle to Israel. Israel defeated him by force of arms and conquered his country from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as the Ammonites, for Jazer marked the Ammonite frontier. </p>

<p>Israel took all these towns. Israel occupied all the Amorite towns, Heshbon and all its dependencies, Heshbon being the capital of Sihon king of the Amorites, who had made war on the first king of Moab and captured all his territory as far as the Arnon. Hence the poets say: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>Come to Heshbon!</span><br />
<span>Let the city of Sihon</span><br />
<span>be rebuilt on firm foundations! </span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>For fire has burst from Heshbon,</span><br />
<span>a flame from the city of Sihon,</span><br />
<span>devouring Ar of Moab,</span><br />
<span>engulfing the heights of the Arnon.</span><br />
<span>Oh, unhappy Moab!</span><br />
<span>People of Chemosh, you are lost!</span><br />
<span>He has resigned his sons as fugitives,</span><br />
<span>and his daughters as prisoners</span><br />
<span>to Sihon king of the Amorites.</span><br />
<span>Their posterity has been destroyed</span><br />
<span>from Heshbon all the way to Dibon,</span><br />
<span>and we have lit a fire</span><br />
<span>all the way from Nophah to Medeba. </span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus Israel occupied the Amorites’ territory. Moses then sent men to reconnoitre Jazer, and Israel took it and its dependencies, evicting the Amorites who lived there. </p>

<p>They then turned and marched on Bashan. Og king of Bashan and all his people marched to meet them and give battle at Edrei. Yahweh said to Moses, “Do not be afraid of him, for I have put him, all his people and his country at your mercy. Treat him as you treated Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon”. So they pressed their attack against him, his sons and all his people until there was no one left alive. And they took possession of his country. </p>

<p id="ch22">The Israelites then set out and pitched their camp in the Plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan opposite Jericho. </p>

<h4>The king of Moab appeals to Balaam (22:2–21)</h4>

<p>Balak son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites, and Moab was terrified of the people, because there were so many of them. </p>

<p>Moab was afraid of the Israelites; he said to the elders of Midian, “This horde will soon have cropped everything around us as closely as an ox crops grass in the countryside”. </p>

<p>Now Balak son of Zippor was king of Moab at the time. He sent messengers to summon Balaam son of Beor, at Pethor on the River, in the territory of the Amawites, saying, “Look, a people coming from Egypt has overrun the whole countryside; they have halted at my very door. I beg you come and curse this people for me, for they are stronger than I am. We may then be able to defeat them and drive them out of the country. For this I know: anyone you bless is blessed, anyone you curse is accursed”. </p>

<p>The elders of Moab and the elders of Midian set out, taking the fee for the divination with them. They found Balaam and gave him Balak’s message. He said to them, “Stay the night here, and I will answer as Yahweh directs me”. So the chiefs of Moab stayed with Balaam. </p>

<p>God came to Balaam and said, “Who are these men staying with you?”. </p>

<p>Balaam said to God, “Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent me this message, ‘Look, a people coming from Egypt has overrun the whole countryside. Come now and curse them for me; I may then be able to defeat them and drive them out’”. </p>

<p>God said to Balaam, “You are not to go with them. You are not to curse the people, for they are blessed”. </p>

<p>In the morning Balaam got up and said to the chiefs sent by Balak, “Go back to your country, for Yahweh will not let me go with you”. </p>

<p>So the chiefs of Moab got up, went back to Balak and said, “Balaam refuses to come with us”. </p>

<p>And again Balak sent chiefs, more numerous and more renowned than the first. They came to Balaam and said, “A message from Balak son of Zippor, ‘Now do not refuse to come to me. I will load you with honours and do whatever you say. I beg you come and curse this people for me’. </p>

<p>In reply, Balaam said to Balak’s envoys, “Even if Balak gave me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go against the order of Yahweh my God in anything, great or small. Now please stay the night here yourselves, and I will learn what else Yahweh has to tell me”. </p>

<p>God came to Balaam during the night and said to him, “Have not these men come to summon you? Get up, go with them, but do only what I tell you to do”. Balaam got up and saddled his donkey and set out with the chiefs of Moab. </p>

<h4>Balaam’s donkey (22:22–35)</h4>

<p>His going kindled Yahweh’s anger, and the angel of Yahweh took his stand on the road to bar his way. Balaam was riding his donkey and his two servants were with him. Now the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand, and she turned off the road into the open country. Balaam then struck the donkey to turn her back onto the road. </p>

<p>The angel of Yahweh then went and stood on a narrow path among the vineyards, with a wall to the right and a wall to the left. The donkey saw the angel of Yahweh and scraped against the wall, scraping Balaam’s foot against 
it, so he struck her again. </p>

<p>The angel of Yahweh then moved and stood in a place so narrow that there was no room to pass either to right or left. When the donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, she lay down under Balaam. Balaam flew into a rage and struck the donkey with his stick. </p>

<p>Yahweh then gave the donkey the power to talk, and she said to Balaam, “What harm have I done you, for you to strike me three times like this?”. </p>

<p>Balaam answered the donkey, “Because you have been making a fool of me! If I had been carrying a sword, I should have killed you by now”. </p>

<p>The donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey, and have I not been your mount all your life? Have I ever behaved like this with you before?”. </p>

<p>“No”, he replied. </p>

<p>Yahweh then opened Balaam’s eyes and he saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand; and he bowed his head and threw himself on his face. And the angel of Yahweh said to him, “Why did you strike your donkey three times like that? I myself had come to bar your way; while I am here your road is blocked. The donkey saw me and turned aside because of me three times. You are lucky she did turn aside, or I should have killed you by now, though I would have spared her”. </p>

<p>Balaam said to the angel of Yahweh, “I have sinned. I did not know you were standing in the road to stop me. But if what I am doing displeases you, I will go home again”. </p>

<p>The angel of Yahweh said to Balaam, “Go with these men, but say only what I tell you to say”. So Balaam went on with the chiefs sent by Balak. </p>

<h4>Balaam and Balak (22:36–23:3)</h4>

<p>Balak learned that Balaam was coming and went out to meet him, in the direction of Ar in Moab, at the Arnon frontier on the country’s furthest boundary. Balak said to Balaam, “Did I not send messengers to summon you? Why did you not come to me? Did you think, perhaps, I could confer no honours on you?”. </p>

<p>Balaam said to Balak, “I have come to you after all. I suppose you know I cannot say anything on my own? The words God puts into my mouth are what I shall say”. </p>

<p>Balaam set out with Balak. They came to Kiriath-Huzoth. Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and offered portions to Balaam and the chiefs who were with him. Next morning Balak took Balaam and brought him up to Bamoth-Baal, from where he could see the edge of the camp. </p>

<p id="ch23">Balaam said to Balak, “Build me seven altars here and prepare me seven bulls and seven rams”. Balak did as Balaam said and offered a burnt offering of one bull and one ram on each altar. Balaam then said to Balak, “Stand beside your burnt offerings while I go away. Perhaps Yahweh will come and meet me. If he does, I shall tell you whatever he reveals to me”. And he withdrew to a bare hill. </p>

<h4>Balaam’s prophecies (23:4–24:25)</h4>

<p>God came to meet Balaam, who said to him, “I have prepared the seven altars and offered a burnt offering of one bull and one ram on each altar”. </p>

<p>Yahweh then put a prophecy into his mouth and said to him, “Go back to Balak, and that is what you must say to him”. So Balaam went back to him, and found him still standing beside his burnt offering, with all the chiefs of Moab. </p>

<p>He then declaimed his poem as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>Balak has brought me from Aram,</span><br />
<span class="i1">the king of Moab from the hills of Kedem:</span><br />
<span>“Come and curse Jacob for me,</span><br />
<span class="i1">come and denounce Israel!”.</span><br />
<span>How shall I curse someöne whom God has not cursed,</span><br />
<span>how denounce someöne God has not denounced?</span><br />
<span>Yes, from the top of the crags I see him,</span><br />
<span>from the hills I descry him:</span><br />
<span>a people that dwells on its own,</span><br />
<span>not to be reckoned among other nations!</span><br />
<span>Who can count the dust of Jacob?</span><br />
<span>Who can number the cloud of Israel?</span><br />
<span>May I die the death of the just,</span><br />
<span>and may my future be like theirs! </span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, and you have heaped blessings on them!”.  </p>

<p>Balaam replied, “Am I to depart from what Yahweh puts into my mouth?”. </p>

<p>Balak then said, “Please come somewhere else. From here you can see only the fringe of them, you cannot see them all. Curse them for me over there”. He led him to the Lookouts’ Field on the top of Pisgah. There he built seven altars and offered a burnt offering of one bull and one ram on each altar. </p>

<p>Balaam said to Balak, “Stand here beside your burnt offerings while I wait over there”. </p>

<p>God came to meet Balaam, he put a prophecy into his mouth and said to him, “Go back to Balak, and that is what you must say to him”. So Balaam went to him and found him still standing beside his burnt offering and all the chiefs of Moab with him. </p>

<p>“What did Yahweh say?”, Balak said to him. </p>

<p>Balaam then declaimed his poem, as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>Stand up, Balak, and listen,</span><br />
<span class="i1">give ear to me, son of Zippor.</span><br />
<span>God is no human being that he should lie,</span><br />
<span>no child of Adam to change his mind.</span><br />
<span>Is it his to say and not to do,</span><br />
<span>is it his to speak and not fulfil?</span><br />
<span>The charge laid on me is to bless,</span><br />
<span>I shall bless, and I cannot reverse it.</span><br />
<span>I have perceived no guilt in Jacob,</span><br />
<span>have seen no perversity in Israel.</span><br />
<span>Yahweh his God is with him,</span><br />
<span>and a royal acclamation to greet him.</span><br />
<span>God has brought him out of Egypt,</span><br />
<span>is like the wild ox’s horns to him.</span><br />
<span>There is no omen whatever against Jacob,</span><br />
<span>no augury at all against Israel.</span><br />
<span>Well may people say of Jacob,</span><br />
<span>of Israel, “What has God achieved?”,</span><br />
<span>for here is a people like a lioness rising,</span><br />
<span>poised like a lion to spring;</span><br />
<span>nor will he lie down until he has devoured his prey</span><br />
<span>and drunk the blood of his slain. </span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Balak said to Balaam, “Very well! Do not curse them. But at least do not bless them!”. </p>

<p>Balaam retorted to Balak, “Did I not tell you? Whatever Yahweh says, I must do”. </p>

<p>Balak then said to Balaam, “Come with me now and I shall take you somewhere else. From there perhaps it will please God to curse them for me”. So Balak led Balaam to the summit of Peor, overlooking the wastelands. </p>

<p>Balaam then said to Balak, “Build me seven altars here and prepare me seven bulls and seven rams”. Balak did as Balaam said and offered a burnt offering of one bull and one ram on each altar. </p>

<p id="ch24">Balaam then saw that it pleased Yahweh to bless Israel. He did not go as before to seek omens but turned towards the desert. Raising his eyes Balaam saw Israel settled tribe by tribe; the spirit of God came on him and he declaimed his poem, as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>The prophecy of Balaam son of Beor,</span><br />

<span>He sees what Shaddai makes him see,</span><br />

<span>and accursed be those who curse you! </span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Balak flew into a rage with Balaam. He struck his hands together and said to Balaam, “I brought you to curse my enemies, and you have insisted on blessing them three times over! So now go home as fast as your legs can carry you. I promised to load you with honours. Yahweh himself has deprived you of them”. </p>

<p>Balaam retorted to Balak, “Did I not tell the messengers you sent me, ‘Even if Balak gave me his house full of gold and silver I could not go against Yahweh’s order and do anything of my own accord, whether for good or ill; whatever Yahweh says is what I shall say?’ . Now that I am going back to my own folk, let me warn you what this people will do to your people, in 
days to come”. He then declaimed his poem, as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>The prophecy of Balaam son of Beor,</span><br />
<span class="i1">the prophecy of the man with far-seeing eyes,</span><br />
<span>the prophecy of one who hears the words of God,</span><br />
<span>of one who knows the knowledge of the Most High.</span><br />
<span>He sees what Shaddai makes him see,</span><br />
<span>receives the divine answer,</span><br />
<span>and his eyes are opened.</span><br />
<span>I see him — but not in the present.</span><br />
<span>I perceive him — but not close at hand:</span><br />
<span>a star is emerging from Jacob,</span><br />
<span>a sceptre is rising from Israel,</span><br />

<span>when Israel exerts his strength,</span><br />
<span class="i1">when Jacob tramples on his enemies</span><br />
<span>and destroys the last survivors of Ar. </span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Balaam then looked at Amalek and declaimed his poem, as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>Amalek, the earliest of nations!</span><br />
<span class="i1">But his posterity will perish forever. </span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He then looked at the Kenites and declaimed his poem, as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>Your dwelling was firm, Kain,</span><br />
<span class="i1">your nest perched high in the rock.</span><br />
<span>But the nest belongs to Beor;</span><br />
<span>how long will you be Asshur’s captive? </span>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He then declaimed his poem, as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
<span>The Sea-people are gathering in the north, </span><br />
<span class="i1">the vessels from the coasts of Kittim.</span><br />
<span>They will bear down on Asshur, bear down on Eber;</span><br />
<span>he too will perish forever. </span>

</blockquote>

<p>Balaam then got up, left and went home, and Balak too went his way. </p>

<h4 id="ch25">Israel at Peor (25:1–18)</h4>

<p>Israel settled at Shittim. The people gave themselves over to prostitution with Moabite women. These invited them to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and bowed down before their gods. With Israel thus committed to the Baal of Peor, Yahweh’s anger was aroused against them. </p>

<p>Yahweh said to Moses, “Take all the leaders of the people. Impale them facing the sun, for Yahweh, to deflect his burning anger from Israel”. </p>

<p>Moses said to the judges of Israel, “Each of you will put to death those of his people who have committed themselves to the Baal of Peor”. </p>

<p>One of the Israelites came along, bringing the Midianite woman into his family, under the very eyes of Moses and the whole community of Israelites as they were weeping at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. The priest Phinehas son of Eleazar, son of Aaron, on seeing this, stood up, left the assembly, seized a lance, followed the Israelite into the alcove, and there ran them both through, the Israelite and the woman, through the stomach. Thus the plague which had struck the Israelites was arrested. In the plague twenty-four thousand of them had died. </p>

<p>Yahweh then spoke and said, “The priest Phinehas son of Eleazar, son of Aaron has deflected my wrath from the Israelites, he being the only one of them to have the same zeal as I have; for which reason, I did not make an end of the Israelites in my zeal. For this reason I say: To him I grant my covenant of peace. To him and his descendants after him, this covenant will assure the priesthood forever. In reward for his zeal for his God, he will have the right to perform the ritual of expiation for the Israelites”. </p>

<p>The Israelite who had been killed (the one who was killed with the Midianite woman) was called Zimri son of Salu, leader of one of the Simeonite families. The woman, the Midianite who was killed, was called Cozbi, daughter of Zur, chief of a clan, of a family, in Midian. </p>

<p>Yahweh then spoke to Moses and said, “Harass the Midianites, strike them down, for harassing you with their guile in the Peor affair and in the affair of their sister Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, the woman who was killed the day the plague came on account of the business of Peor”. </p>

<h2 id="viii">VIII: Further Legislation (26:1–30:17)</h2>

<h4>The census (26:1–56)</h4>

<p>After this plague, Yahweh spoke to Moses and to the priest Eleazar son of Aaron and said: </p>

<p>“Take a census of the whole community of Israelites, by families: all those of twenty years and over, fit to bear arms in Israel”. </p>

<p>So Moses and the priest Eleazar took a census of them on the Plains of Moab, near the Jordan by Jericho. They counted (as Yahweh had ordered Moses and the Israelites after leaving Egypt) men of twenty years and over: </p>

<p>Reuben, the first-born of Israel. The sons of Reuben: for Hanoch, the Hanochite clan; for Pallu, the Palluite clan; for Hezron, the Hezronite clan; for Carmi, the Carmite clan. These were the Reubenite clans. They numbered forty-three thousand seven hundred and thirty men. </p>

<p>The sons of Pallu: Eliab. The sons of Eliab: Nemuel, Dathan and Abiram. These two, Dathan and Abiram, men of repute in the community, were the ones who revolted against Moses and Aaron; they belonged to Korah’s group when it revolted against Yahweh. The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them (with Korah when that group perished), when fire consumed the two hundred and fifty men. They were a sign. Korah’s sons, however, did not perish. </p>

<p>The sons of Simeon by clans: for Nemuel, the Nemuelite clan; for Jamin, the Jaminite clan; for Jachin, the Jachinite clan; for Zerah, the Zerahite clan; for Shaul, the Shaulite clan. These were the Simeonite clans. They numbered twenty-two thousand two hundred men. </p>

<p>The sons of Gad by clans: for Zephon, the Zephonite clan; for Haggi, the Haggite clan; for Shuni, the Shunite clan; for Ozni, the Oznite clan; for Eri, the Erite clan; for Arod, the Arodite clan; for Areli, the Arelite clan. These were the clans of the sons of Gad. They numbered forty thousand five hundred men. </p>

<p>The sons of Judah: Er and Onan. Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. The other sons of Judah became clans: for Shelah, the Shelahite clan; for Perez, the Perezzite clan; for Zerah, the Zerahite clan. The sons of Perez were: for Hezron, the Hezronite clan; for Hamul, the Hamulite clan. These were the clans of Judah. They numbered seventy-six thousand five hundred men. </p>

<p>The sons of Issachar by clans: for Tola, the Tolaite clan; for Puvah, the Puvahite clan; for Jashub, the Jashubite clan; for Shimron, the Shimronite clan. These were the clans of Issachar. They numbered sixty-four thousand three hundred men. </p>

<p>The sons of Zebulun by clans: for Sered, the Seredite clan; for Elon, the Elonite clan; for Jahleel, the Jahleelite clan. These were the clans of Zebulun. They numbered sixty thousand five hundred men. </p>

<p>The sons of Joseph by clans: Manasseh and Ephraim. </p>

<p>The sons of Manasseh: for Machir, the Machirite clan; Machir fathered Gilead: for Gilead, the Gileadite clan. These were the sons of Gilead: for lezer, the lezerite clan; for Helek, the Helekite clan; Asriel, the Asrielite clan; Shechem, the Shechemite clan; Shemida, the Shemidaite clan; Hepher, the Hepherite clan. Zelophehad son of Hepher had no sons, only daughters; the names of Zelophehad’s daughters were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah and Tirzah. These were the clans of Manasseh. They numbered fifty-two thousand seven hundred men. </p>

<p>These were the sons of Ephraim by clans: for Shuthelah, the Shuthelahite clan; for Becher, the Becherite clan; for Tahan, the Tahanite clan. These were the sons of Shuthelah: for Eran, the Eranite clan. These were the clans of Ephraim. They numbered thirty-two thousand five hundred men. </p>

<p>These were the sons of Joseph by clans. </p>

<p>The sons of Benjamin by clans: for Bela, the Belaite clan; for Ashbel, the Ashbelite clan; for Ahiram, the Ahiramite clan; for Shephupham, the Shephuphamite clan; for Hupham, the Huphamite clan. Bela’s sons were Ard and Naaman; for Ard, the Ardite clan; for Naaman, the Naamanite clan. These were the sons of Benjamin by clans. They numbered forty-five thousand six hundred men. </p>

<p>These were the sons of Dan by clans: for Shuham, the Shuhamite clan. These were the sons of Dan by clans. All the Shuhamite clans numbered sixty-four thousand four hundred men. </p>

<p>The sons of Asher by clans: for Imnah, the Imnahite clan; for Ishvi, the Ishvihite clan; for Beriah, the Beriahite clan. For the sons of Beriah: for Heber, the Heberite clan; for Malchiel, the Malchielite clan. The daughter of Asher was called Serah. These were the clans of Asher. They numbered fifty-three thousand four hundred men. </p>

<p>The sons of Naphtali by clans: for Jahzeel, the Jahzeelite clan; for Guni, the Gunite clan; for Jezer, the Jezerite clan; for Shillem, the Shillemite clan. These were the clans of Naphtali as divided into clans. The sons of Naphtali numbered forty-five thousand four hundred men. </p>

<p>Of the Israelites thus numbered, there were six hundred and one thousand seven hundred and thirty men. </p>

<p>Yahweh then spoke to Moses and said, “The country must be shared out among these as a heritage, proportionately to the number of those inscribed. To the large in number you will give a large area of land, to the small in number a small area; to each the heritage will be in proportion to the number registered. The sharing out of the country must, however, be done by lot. Each will receive a heritage proportionate to the number of names in their patriarchal tribes; the heritage of each tribe will be shared out by lot, depending on its larger or smaller numbers”. </p>

<h4>Census of the Levites (26:57–65)</h4>

<p>These, by clans, are the Levites that were registered: for Gershon, the Gershonite clan; for Kohath, the Kohathite clan; for Merari, the Merarite clan. </p>

<p>These are the Levite clans: the Libnite clan, the Hebronite clan, the Mahlite clan, the Mushite clan, the Korahite clan. </p>

<p>Kohath fathered Amram. Amram’s wife was called Jokebed daughter of Levi, born to him in Egypt. To Amram she bore Aaron, Moses and Miriam their sister. Aaron fathered Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. Nadab and Abihu died when they brought unauthorised fire before Yahweh. </p>

<p>Altogether twenty-three thousand males of one month and over were registered. They were not registered with the Israelites, since they were given no heritage with the Israelites. </p>

<p>Such were the men registered by Moses and the priest Eleazar who took a census of the Israelites on the Plains of Moab near the Jordan by Jericho. Not one of them was among those whom Moses and the priest Aaron had registered when they counted the Israelites in the desert of Sinai; for Yahweh had told them that these were to die in the desert and that none of them would be left except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun. </p>

<h4 id="ch27">The inheritance of daughters (27:1–11)</h4>

<p>There then came forward the daughters of Zelophehad son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh; he belonged to the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph. His daughters’ names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah and Tirzah. They appeared before Moses, the priest Eleazar, the leaders and the whole community, at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, and said, “Our father died in the desert. He was not a member of the party who banded together against Yahweh, Korah’s party; it was for his own sin that he died without sons. Why should our father’s name be lost to his clan? Since he had no son, give us some property like our father’s kinsmen”. </p>

<p>Moses took their case before Yahweh, and Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, “Zelophehad’s daughters are right in what they say. You will indeed give them a property to be their heritage among their father’s kinsmen; see that their father’s heritage is passed on to them. Then speak to the Israelites and say, ‘If a man dies without sons, his heritage will pass to his daughter. If he has no daughter, the heritage will go to his brothers. If he has no brothers, his heritage will go to his father’s brothers. If his father has no brothers, his heritage will go to the member of his clan who is most nearly related; it will become his property. This will be a legal rule for the Israelites, as Yahweh has ordered Moses’”. </p>

<h4>Joshua the head of the community (27:12–14)</h4>

<p>Yahweh said to Moses, “Climb this mountain of the Abarim range, and look at the country which I have given to the Israelites. After you have seen it, you will be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother was. For you both rebelled in the desert of Zin when the community disputed with me and when I ordered you to assert my holiness before their eyes by means of the water”. (These were the Waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the desert of Zin.) </p>

<p>Moses then said to Yahweh, “May it please Yahweh, God of the spirits that give life to all living creatures, to appoint a leader for this community, to be at their head in all their undertakings, a man who will lead them out and bring them in, so that Yahweh’s community will not be like sheep without a shepherd”. </p>

<p>Yahweh then said to Moses, “Take Joshua son of Nun, a man in whom the spirit dwells, and lay your hand on him. Bring him before the priest Eleazar and the whole community and give him your orders in their presence, conferring some of your own authority on him, so that the whole community of Israelites will obey him. He will present himself to the priest Eleazar who will consult Yahweh on his behalf by means of the rite of the urim; at his command, they will go out and, at his command, they will come in, he and all the Israelites 
with him, the whole community”. </p>

<p>Moses did as Yahweh had ordered. He took Joshua, brought him before the priest Eleazar and the whole community, laid his hands on him and gave him his orders, as Yahweh had directed through Moses. </p>

<h4 id="ch28">Regulations for sacrifices (28:1–30:1)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, “Give the Israelites this order: </p>

<p>‘Take care to bring me my offering, my sustenance in the form of food 
burnt as a smell pleasing to me, at the proper time’. </p>

<p>“You will then say to them: ‘This is the food which you will burn in offering to Yahweh: </p>

<h5>a: Daily sacrifices (28:4–8)</h5>

<p>‘Every day, two unblemished yearling lambs as a perpetual burnt offering. You will offer the first lamb in the morning and the second lamb at twilight, with a cereal offering of one-tenth of an <i>ephah</i> of fine flour mixed with one-quarter of a <i>hin</i> of crushed-olive oil. Such was the perpetual burnt offering made on Mount Sinai as a pleasing smell, as food burnt for Yahweh. The accompanying libation will be of one-quarter of a <i>hin</i> for each lamb; the libation of fermented liquor for Yahweh will be poured inside the sanctuary. The second lamb you will offer at twilight, offering it with the same cereal offering and the same libation as in the morning, as food burnt as a smell pleasing to Yahweh. </p>

<h5>b: The Sabbath (28:9–10)</h5>

<p>‘On the Sabbath day, you will offer two unblemished yearling lambs and two-tenths of an <i>ephah</i> of fine flour as a cereal offering, mixed with oil, as well as the accompanying libation. The Sabbath burnt offering will be offered every Sabbath in addition to the perpetual burnt offering, and the accompanying libation similarly. </p>

<h5>c: The feast of New Moon (28:11–15)</h5>

<p>‘At the beginning of each of your months you will offer a burnt offering to Yahweh: two young bulls, one ram and seven yearling lambs, without blemish; for each bull a cereal offering of three-tenths of an <i>ephah</i> of fine flour mixed with oil; for each ram, a cereal offering of two-tenths of fine flour mixed with oil; for each lamb, a cereal offering of one-tenth of fine flour mixed with oil: as a burnt offering, as a pleasing smell, as food burnt for Yahweh. The accompanying libations will be of half a <i>hin</i> of wine for a bull, one-third of a <i>hin</i> for a ram and one-quarter of a <i>hin</i> for a lamb. This will be the monthly burnt offering, month after month, every month of the year. In addition to the perpetual burnt offering, a goat will be offered to Yahweh, as a sacrifice for sin, with its accompanying libation. </p>

<h5>d: The feast of Unleavened Bread (28:16–25)</h5>

<p>‘The fourteenth day of the first month is the Passover of Yahweh, and the fifteenth day of this month is a feast day. For seven days unleavened bread will be eaten. On the first day there will be a sacred assembly; you will do no heavy work. As food burnt as a burnt offering you will offer Yahweh two young bulls, a ram and seven yearling lambs, without blemish. The accompanying cereal offering of fine flour mixed with oil will be three-tenths of an <i>ephah</i> for a bull, two-tenths for a ram, and one-tenth for each of the seven lambs. There will also be a goat as a sacrifice for sin, for performing the rite of expiation for you. You will offer these in addition to the morning burnt offering, which is a perpetual burnt offering. You will do this every day for seven days. It is sustenance, food burnt as a smell pleasing to Yahweh, to be offered in addition to the perpetual burnt offering and its accompanying libation. On the seventh day you will hold a sacred assembly; you will do no heavy work. </p>

<h5>e: The feast of Weeks (28:26–31)</h5>

<p>‘On the day of the first-fruits, when you make your offering of new fruits to Yahweh at your feast of Weeks, you will hold a sacred assembly; you will do no heavy work. As a burnt offering as a smell pleasing to Yahweh, you will offer two young bulls, one ram and seven yearling lambs. The accompanying cereal offering of fine flour mixed with oil will be three-tenths of an <i>ephah</i> for each bull, two-tenths for the ram, and one-tenth for each of the seven lambs. There will also be a goat as a sacrifice for sin, for performing the rite of expiation for you. You will offer these in addition to the perpetual burnt offering and its accompanying cereal offering 
and libations. </p>

<h5 id="ch29">f: The feast of Acclamations (29:1–6)</h5>

<p>‘In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you will hold a sacred assembly; you will do no heavy work. For you this will be a day of Acclamations. As a burnt offering, as a smell pleasing to Yahweh, you will offer one young bull, one ram and seven yearling lambs, without blemish. The accompanying cereal offering of fine flour mixed with oil will be three-tenths of an <i>ephah</i> for the bull, two-tenths for the ram, and one-tenth for each of the seven lambs. There will also be a goat as a sacrifice for sin, for performing the rite of expiation for you. This is in addition to the monthly burnt offering and its cereal offering, the perpetual burnt offering and its cereal offering, and the accompanying libations enjoined by law, as a pleasing smell, as food burnt for Yahweh. </p>

<h5>g: The Day of Expiation (29:7–11)</h5>

<p>‘On the tenth day of this seventh month, you will hold a sacred assembly; you will fast and do no work. As a burnt offering for Yahweh, as a pleasing smell, you will offer one young bull, one ram and seven yearling lambs, which you will choose as being without blemish. The accompanying cereal offering of fine flour mixed with oil will be three-tenths of an <i>ephah</i> for the bull, two-tenths for the ram, and one-tenth for each of the seven lambs. And a goat will be offered as a sacrifice for sin. This is in addition to the victim for sin at the feast of Expiation, to the perpetual burnt offering and its cereal offering, and their accompanying libations. </p>

<h5>h: the feast of Shelters (29:12–30:1)</h5>

<p>‘On the fifteenth day of the seventh month you will hold a sacred assembly; you will do no heavy work, and for seven days you will celebrate a feast for Yahweh. As a burnt offering, as food burnt as a smell pleasing to Yahweh, you will offer thirteen young bulls, two rams and fourteen yearling lambs, without blemish. The accompanying cereal offering of fine flour mixed with oil will be three-tenths of an <i>ephah</i> for each of the thirteen bulls, two-tenths for each of the two rams, and one-tenth for each of the fourteen lambs; also one goat as a sacrifice for sin. This is in addition to the perpetual burnt offering and its cereal offering and libation. </p>

<p>‘On the second day: twelve young bulls, two rams and fourteen yearling lambs, without blemish; the accompanying cereal offering and libations, as prescribed, in proportion to the number of bulls, rams and lambs; also one goat as a sacrifice for sin. This is in addition to the perpetual burnt offering and its cereal offering and libations. </p>

<p>‘On the third day: eleven bulls, two rams and fourteen yearling lambs, without blemish; the accompanying cereal offering and libations, as prescribed, in proportion to the number of bulls, rams and lambs; also one goat as a sacrifice for sin. This is in addition to the perpetual burnt offering and its cereal offering and libations. </p>

<p>‘On the fourth day: ten bulls, two rams and fourteen yearling lambs, without blemish; the accompanying cereal offering and libations, as prescribed, in proportion to the number of bulls, rams and lambs; also one goat as a sacrifice for sin. This is in addition to the perpetual burnt offering and its cereal offering and libation. </p>

<p>‘On the fifth day: nine bulls, two rams and fourteen yearling lambs, without blemish;  the accompanying cereal offering and libations, as prescribed, in proportion to the number of bulls, rams and lambs; also one goat as a sacrifice for sin. This is in addition to the perpetual burnt offering and its cereal offering and libation. </p>

<p>‘On the sixth day: eight bulls, two rams and fourteen yearling lambs, without blemish; the accompanying cereal offering and libations, as prescribed, in proportion to the number of bulls, rams and lambs; also one goat as a sacrifice for sin. This is in addition to the perpetual burnt offering and its cereal offering and libations. </p>

<p>‘On the seventh day: seven bulls, two rams and fourteen yearling lambs, without blemish; the accompanying cereal offering and libations, as prescribed, in proportion to the number of bulls, rams and lambs; also one goat as a sacrifice for sin. This is in addition to the perpetual burnt offering and its cereal offering and libation. </p>

<p>‘On the eighth day you will hold an assembly; you will do no heavy work. As a burnt offering, as food burnt as a smell pleasing to Yahweh, you will offer one bull, one ram and seven yearling lambs, without blemish; the accompanying cereal offering and libations, as prescribed, in proportion to the number of bulls, rams and lambs; also one goat as a sacrifice for sin. This is in addition to the perpetual burnt offering and its cereal offering and libation. </p>

<p>‘This is what you are to do for Yahweh at your solemn feasts, over and above your votive offerings and your voluntary offerings, your burnt offerings, cereal offerings and libations, and your peace offerings’”. </p>

<p id="ch30">Moses told the Israelites exactly what Yahweh had ordered him. </p>

<h4>Laws concerning vows (30:2–30:17</h4>

<p>Moses spoke to the tribal leaders of the Israelites and said, “This is what Yahweh has ordered: </p>

<p>‘If a man makes a vow to Yahweh or a formal pledge under oath, he must not break his word: whatever he promises by word of mouth he must do. </p>

<p>‘If a woman makes a vow to Yahweh or a formal pledge during her youth, while she is still in her father’s house, and if her father hears about this vow or pledge made by her and says nothing to her, her vow, whatever it may be, will be binding, and the pledge she has taken, whatever it may be, will be binding. But if her father on the day he learns of it expresses his disapproval of it, then none of the vows or pledges she has taken will be binding. Yahweh will not hold her to it, since her father has expressed his disapproval. </p>

<p>‘If, being bound by vows or by a pledge voiced without due reflection, she then marries, and if her husband hears of it but says nothing on the day he learns of it, her vows will be binding and the pledges she has taken will be binding. But if on the day he learns of it he expresses his disapproval to her, this will annul the vow that she has made or the pledge that binds her, voiced without due reflection. Yahweh will not hold her to it. </p>

<p>‘The vow of a widow or a divorced woman and all pledges taken by her are binding on her. </p>

<p>‘If she has made a vow or taken a pledge under oath while in her husband’s house, and if when the husband learns of it he says nothing to her and does not express disapproval to her, then the vow, whatever it is, will be binding, and the pledge, whatever it is, will be binding. But if the husband when he hears of it annuls it on the day he learns of it, no undertaking of hers, be it vow or pledge, will be binding. Since the husband has annulled it, Yahweh will not hold her to it. </p>

<p>‘Every vow or oath that is binding on the wife may be endorsed or annulled by the husband. </p>

<p>‘If by the following day the husband has said nothing to her, it means that he endorses her vow, whatever it may be, or her pledge, whatever it may be. He endorses them if he says nothing on the day he learns of them. But if, having learnt of them, he annuls them later, he will bear the consequences for his wife’s guilt’”. </p>

<p>Such were the laws which Yahweh prescribed to Moses, concerning the relationship between a man and his wife, and between a father and his daughter while still young and living in her father’s home. </p>

<h2 id="ix">IX: Booty and its Allocation (31:1–36:13)</h2>

<h4>The holy war against Midian (31:1–12)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, “Exact the full vengeance for the Israelites on the Midianites. Afterwards you will be gathered to your 
people”. </p>

<p>Moses said to the people, “Some of you are to take up arms for Yahweh’s campaign against Midian, to carry out the vengeance of Yahweh on Midian. You will put a thousand men in the field from each of the tribes of Israel”. </p>

<p>In this way Israel’s thousands provided twelve thousand men equipped for war, one thousand from each tribe: Moses put them in the field, one thousand from each tribe, with Phinehas, son of the priest Eleazar, to go with them carrying the sacred objects and the trumpets for the battle cry. </p>

<p>They made war on Midian, as Yahweh had ordered Moses, and put every male to death. What is more, they killed the kings of Midian, Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur and Reba, the five Midianite kings; they also put Balaam son of Beor to the sword. The Israelites took the Midianite women and their little ones captive and carried off all their cattle, all their flocks and all their goods as booty. They set fire to the towns where they lived and to all their encampments. Then, taking all their booty, everything they had captured, human and animal, they brought the captives, spoil and booty to Moses, the priest Eleazar and the whole community of Israelites at the camp on the Plains of Moab, near the Jordan by Jericho. </p>

<h4>The slaughter of the women and purification of the booty (31:13–24)</h4>

<p>Moses, the priest Eleazar and all the leaders of the community went out of the camp to meet them. Moses was enraged with the officers of the army, the commanders of the thousands and commanders of the hundreds, who had come back from this military expedition. He said, “Why have you spared the life of all the women? They were the very ones who, on Balaam’s advice, caused the Israelites to be unfaithful to Yahweh in the affair at Peor: hence the plague which struck Yahweh’s community. So kill all the male children and kill all the women who have ever slept with a man; but spare the lives of the young girls who have never slept with a man, and keep them for yourselves. As for you, bivouac outside the camp for seven days, everyone who has killed anyone or touched a corpse. Purify yourselves and your prisoners on the third and seventh days, and purify all clothing, everything made of skin, everything woven of goat’s hair and everything made of wood”. </p>

<p>The priest Eleazar said to the soldiers who had come back from the campaign, “This is an article of the Law which Yahweh prescribed to Moses: although gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin and lead, everything that can withstand fire can be cleaned by being passed through fire, it must still be purified with water for purification. Whatever cannot resist fire you must pass through water. </p>

<p>“Wash your clothes on the seventh day and you will then be clean. You may then reënter the camp”. </p>

<h4>The allocation of the booty (31:25–47)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“With the priest Eleazar and the heads of families in the community, take a count of the spoils and captives, human and animal. You will then share out the spoil, half and half, between those who fought the campaign and the rest of the community. From the share of the combatants who took part in the campaign, you will set aside one out of every five hundred persons, oxen, donkeys and sheep as Yahweh’s portion. You will take this from the half share coming to them and give it to the priest Eleazar as the portion set aside for Yahweh. From the half coming to the Israelites, you will take one out of every fifty persons, oxen, donkeys, sheep, and all other animals, and give them to the Levites who are responsible for Yahweh’s Dwelling”. </p>

<p>Moses and the priest Eleazar did as Yahweh had ordered Moses. The spoils, the remainder of the booty captured by the soldiers, came to six hundred and seventy-five thousand sheep and goats, seventy-two thousand head of cattle, sixty-one thousand donkeys, and in persons, women who had never slept with a man, thirty-two thousand in all. Half was assigned to those who had taken part in the war, namely three hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep and goats, of which Yahweh’s portion was six hundred and seventy-five, thirty-six thousand head of cattle, of which Yahweh’s portion was seventy-two, thirty thousand five hundred donkeys, of which Yahweh’s portion was sixty-one, and sixteen thousand persons, of which Yahweh’s portion was thirty-two. Moses gave the priest Eleazar the portion set aside for Yahweh, as Yahweh had ordered Moses. </p>

<p>As for the half coming to the Israelites which Moses had separated from that of the combatants, this half, the community’s share, came to three hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep and goats, thirty-six thousand head of cattle, thirty thousand five hundred donkeys and sixteen thousand persons. From this half, the Israelites’ share, Moses took one out of every fifty, human and animal, and gave them to the Levites who were responsible for Yahweh’s Dwelling, as Yahweh had ordered Moses. </p>

<h4>The offerings (31:48–54)</h4>

<p>The officers of the thousands who had fought the campaign, the commanders of the thousands and commanders of the hundreds, came to Moses and said, “Your servants have numbered the soldiers under their command: none of our men is missing. So, as an offering for Yahweh, we have brought what each of us has found in the way of gold ornaments, armlets and bracelets, rings, earrings and breastplates, to make expiation for ourselves before Yahweh”. Moses and the priest Eleazar accepted this gold from them, all this jewellery. This portion of gold given to Yahweh by the commanders of the thousands and commanders of the hundreds amounted to sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels. </p>

<p>Each of the soldiers took his own booty. But Moses and the priest Eleazar, having accepted the gold from the commanders of the thousands and commanders of the hundreds, brought it into the Tent of Meeting, to be a reminder of the Israelites before Yahweh. </p>

<h4 id="ch32">The allocation of the Transjordan (32:1–42)</h4>

<p>Now, the Reubenites and Gadites owned very large herds of cattle. Having seen that the territories of Jazer and Gilead formed an ideal region for raising stock, the Gadites and Reubenites went to Moses, the priest Eleazar and the leaders of the community, and said to them, “The territory of Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo and Beon, which Yahweh has conquered before the advancing community of Israel, is ideal land for raising stock, and your servants are cattle breeders.  So, they said, “if you approve, give your servants this land for us to own; do not make us cross the Jordan”. </p>

<p>Moses said to the Gadites and Reubenites, “Do you intend your brothers to go into battle while you stay here? Why are you discouraging the Israelites from crossing to the country which Yahweh has given them? Your fathers behaved in the same way when I sent them from Kadesh-Barnea to see the country, for, having gone as far as the Valley of Eshcol and seen the country, they discouraged the Israelites from entering the country which Yahweh had given them. Hence Yahweh’s anger was aroused that day and he swore this oath, ‘No man of twenty years and over, who left Egypt, shall set eyes on the country which I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob…, for they have not followed me absolutely, except for Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua son of Nun: these indeed have followed Yahweh absolutely’. Yahweh’s anger being aroused by Israel, he made them wander in the desert for forty years, until the generation that offended Yahweh had all disappeared. And now you rise up in your father’s place, offshoot of sinful stock, to increase Yahweh’s burning anger with Israel even more! If you turn away from him, he will prolong the time spent in the desert, and you will bring about this 
entire people’s ruin”. </p>

<p>They came to Moses and said, “We should like to build sheepfolds here for our flocks and towns for our little ones. We ourselves will take up arms and lead the Israelites until we have brought them to the place appointed for them, while our little ones stay in the fortified towns to be safe from the local inhabitants. We will not return to our homes until every one of the Israelites has taken possession of his heritage. For we shall have no heritage with them on the other bank of the Jordan or beyond, since our heritage has fallen to us here, east of the Jordan”. </p>

<p>Moses said to them, “If you do as you have said, if you are prepared to fight before Yahweh, and if all those of you who bear arms cross the Jordan before Yahweh, until he has driven all his enemies out before him, then, once the country has become subject to Yahweh, you may go back, and will have discharged your obligation to Yahweh and Israel, and Yahweh will consider this territory yours. But if you do not, you will sin against Yahweh, and be sure your sin will find you out. Build towns, then, for your little ones and folds for your flocks; but do what you have promised”. </p>

<p>The Gadites and Reubenites said to Moses, “Your servants will do as my lord directs. Our little ones, our wives, our flocks and all our livestock will stay in the towns of Gilead, but your servants, each armed for war, will cross in Yahweh’s name and fight, as my lord says”.</p>

<p>So Moses gave orders about them to the priest Eleazar, Joshua son of Nun, and the heads of families in the Israelite tribes. Moses said to them, “If the Gadites and Reubenites, all those under arms, cross the Jordan with you to fight in Yahweh’s name, then, once the country has become subject to you, you will give them the territory of Gilead as theirs. But if they will not cross with you under arms, they will receive their domains in Canaan with the rest 
of you”. </p>

<p>To this, the Gadites and Reubenites replied, “What Yahweh has said to your servants, we shall do. Under arms, we shall cross in Yahweh’s name into Canaan, so that ownership of our heritage on this side of the Jordan will be ours”. Moses then gave them — the Gadites, the Reubenites and the half-tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph — the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the country and the towns within its territory, and the country’s frontier-towns. </p>

<p>The Gadites rebuilt Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, Atroth-Shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah, Beth-Nimrah and Beth-Haran as fortified towns with folds for the flocks. </p>

<p>The Reubenites rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim, Nebo and Baal-Meon (the names of which were altered), and Sibmah, giving new names to the towns which they rebuilt. </p>

<p>The descendants of Machir son of Manasseh went to Gilead. They conquered it and drove out the Amorites who were there. Moses gave Gilead to Machir son of Manasseh, and he settled there. Jair son of Manasseh went and seized their encampments, renaming them the Encampments of Jair. Nobah went and seized Kenat with its dependent townships, and called it Nobah after himself. </p>

<h4 id="ch33">The stages of the Exodus (33:1–49)</h4>

<p>These were the stages of the journey made by the Israelites when they left Egypt in their companies under the leadership of Moses and Aaron. Moses recorded their starting-points in writing whenever they moved on at Yahweh’s order. The stages, from one starting-point to another, were as follows: </p>

<p>They left Rameses in the first month. It was the fifteenth day of the first month, the day following the Passover, when the Israelites confidently set out, under the eyes of all Egypt. The Egyptians were burying those of their own people whom Yahweh had struck down, all the first-born; Yahweh had carried out his judgement on their gods. </p>

<p>The Israelites left Rameses and camped at Succoth. Then they left Succoth and encamped at Etham which is on the edge of the desert. They left Etham, turned back to Pi-Hahiroth, opposite Baal-Zephon, and encamped before Migdol. They left Pi-Hahiroth, crossed the sea into the desert, and after marching for three days in the desert of Etham they encamped at Marah. They left Marah and reached Elim. At Elim there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees; they encamped there. They left Elim and encamped by the Sea of Reeds. They left the Sea of Reeds and encamped in the desert of Sin. They left the desert of Sin and encamped at Dophkah. They left Dophkah and encamped at Alush. They left Alush and encamped at Rephidim; the people found no drinking water there. They left Rephidim and encamped in the desert of Sinai. They left the desert of Sinai and encamped at Kibroth-ha-Taavah. They left Kibroth-ha-Taavah and encamped at Hazeroth. They left Hazeroth and encamped at Rithmah. They left Rithmah and encamped at Rimmon-Perez. They left Rimmon-Perez and encamped at Libnah. They left Libnah and encamped at Rissah. They left Rissah and encamped at Kehelathah. They left Kehelathah and encamped at Mount Shepher. They left Mount Shepher and encamped at Haradah. They left Haradah and encamped at Makheloth. They left Makheloth and encamped at Tahath. They left Tahath and encamped at Terah. They left Terah and encamped at Mithkah. They left Mithkah and encamped at Hashmonah. They left Hashmonah and encamped at Moseroth. They left Moseroth and encamped at Bene-Jaakan. They left Bene-Jaakan and encamped at Hor-Gidgad. They left Hor-Gidgad and encamped at Jotbathah. They left Jotbathah and encamped at Abronah. They left Abronah and encamped at Ezion-Geber. They left Ezion-Geber and encamped in the desert of Zin, that is, at Kadesh. They left Kadesh and encamped at Mount Hor, on the borders of the land of Edom. The priest Aaron went up Mount Hor on Yahweh’s orders and died there in the fortieth year of the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, in the fifth month, on the first day of the month. Aaron was a hundred and twenty-three years old when he died on Mount Hor. The king of Arad, the Canaanite who lived in the Negeb of Canaan, heard of the Israelites’ arrival. They left Mount Hor and encamped at Zalmonah. They left Zalmonah and encamped at Punon. They left Punon and encamped at Oboth. They left Oboth and encamped in Moabite territory at lye-Abarim. They left lyim and encamped at Dibon-Gad. They left Dibon-Gad and encamped at Almon-Diblathaim. They left Almon-Diblathaim and encamped in the Abarim mountains facing Nebo. They left the Abarim mountains and encamped on the Plains of Moab, near the Jordan opposite Jericho. They encamped near the Jordan between Beth-ha-Jeshimoth and Abel-ha-Shittim, on the Plains of Moab. </p>

<h4>The allocation of Canaan. God’s order (33:50–56)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses on the Plains of Moab, near the Jordan by Jericho, and said: </p>

<p>“Speak to the Israelites and say: </p>

<p>‘When you have crossed the Jordan into Canaan, you will drive out all the local inhabitants before you. You will destroy all their painted images, you will destroy all their metal statues and you will demolish all their high places. You will take possession of the country and settle in it, for I have given you the country as your property. You will share it out by lot among your clans. To a large clan you will give a larger heritage, and to a smaller clan you will give a smaller heritage. Where the lot falls for each, that will be his. Your heritage will depend on the size of your tribe. If, however, you do not drive out the local inhabitants before you, the ones you allow to remain will be thorns in your eyes and thistles in your sides and will harass you in the country where you are living, and I shall treat you as I intended to treat them’”. </p>

<h4 id="ch34">The boundaries of Canaan (34:1–15)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, “Give the Israelites this order. Say: ‘When you enter the country (Canaan), this will be the country which forms your heritage. This is Canaan as defined by its boundaries: </p>

<p>‘The southern part of your country will start from the desert of Zin, on the borders of Edom. Your southern boundary will start on the east at the end of the Salt Sea. It will then turn south towards the Ascent of the Scorpions and go by Zin to end in the south at Kadesh-Barnea. It will then run towards Hazar-Addar and pass through Azmon. From Azmon the boundary will turn towards the Torrent of Egypt and end at the Sea. </p>

<p>‘Your seaboard will be on the Great Sea; this will be your western boundary. </p>

<p>‘Your northern boundary will be as follows: you will draw a line from the Great Sea to Mount Hor, then from Mount Hor you will draw a line to the Pass of Hamath, and the boundary will end at Zedad. From there it will run on to Ziphron and end at Hazar-Enan. This will be your northern boundary. </p>

<p>‘You will then draw your eastern boundary from Hazar-Enan to Shepham. The boundary will run down from Shepham towards Riblah on the east side of Ain. Further down it will keep to the eastern shore of the Sea of Chinnereth. The frontier will then follow the Jordan and end at the Salt Sea. </p>

<p>‘Such will be your country with the boundaries surrounding it’”. </p>

<p>Moses then gave the Israelites this order: </p>

<p>“This is the country, where your heritages will be assigned by lot, and which Yahweh has ordered to be given to the nine tribes and the half-tribe, for the tribe of the Reubenites with their families and the tribe of the Gadites with their families have already received their heritage; the half-tribe of Manasseh has also received its heritage. These two tribes and the half-tribe have received their heritage on the other side of the Jordan by 
Jericho, to the east, towards the sunrise”. </p>

<h4>The leaders in charge of the allocation (34:17–29)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Here are the names of the men who will divide the country up for you: the priest Eleazar and Joshua son of Nun, and you will take one leader from each tribe to divide the country up into heritages. Here are the names of these men: </p>

<p>“For the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh; </p>

<p>“for the tribe of the Simeonites, Shemuel son of Ammihud; </p>

<p>“for the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad son of Chislon; </p>

<p>“for the tribe of the Danites, the leader Bukki son of Jogli; </p>

<p>“for the sons of Joseph: for the tribe of Manasseh, the leader Hanniel son of Ephod; </p>

<p>“for the tribe of the Ephraimites, the leader Kemuel son of Shiphtan; </p>

<p>“for the tribe of the Zebulunites, the leader Elizaphan son of Parnach; </p>

<p>“for the tribe of the Issacharites, the leader Paltiel son of Azzan; </p>

<p>“for the tribe of the Asherites, the leader Ahihud son of Shelomi; </p>

<p>“for the tribe of the Naphtalites, the leader Pedahel son of Ammihud”. </p>

<p>These were the men whom Yahweh ordered to divide Canaan into heritages for the Israelites. </p>

<h4 id="ch35">The portion of the Levites (35:1–8)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses on the Plains of Moab, near the Jordan by Jericho, and said: </p>

<p>“Order the Israelites, from the heritage they possess, to give the Levites towns in which to live and pasture land around the towns. You will give these to the Levites. The towns must be their homes and the surrounding pasture land must be for their cattle, their possessions and all their animals. The pasture land surrounding the towns which you give to the Levites will extend, from the walls of the towns, for a thousand cubits all around. </p>

<p>“Outside the town, measure two thousand cubits to the east, two thousand cubits to the south, two thousand cubits to the west and two thousand cubits to the north, the town lying in the centre; such will be the pasture lands of these towns. The towns you give to the Levites will be six cities of refuge, ceded by you as sanctuary for those who commit manslaughter; and you will give forty-two towns in addition. Altogether you will give the Levites forty-eight towns, with their pasture lands. Of the towns which you give from the Israelites’ possessions, you will give more from those who have more, and less from those who have less. Each will give some of his towns to the Levites, in proportion to the heritage he himself has received”. </p>

<h4>Cities of refuge (35:9–34)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Speak to the Israelites and say: </p>

<p>‘Once you have crossed the Jordan into Canaan, you will find towns, some of which you will make into cities of refuge where those who have accidentally committed manslaughter can take sanctuary. These towns will afford you refuge from the avenger of blood, so that the killer will not be put to death before standing trial before the community. Of the towns you give, six will serve you as cities of refuge: as cities of refuge, you will give three towns on the other side of the Jordan and will give three towns in Canaan. These six towns will serve as refuge for the Israelites, for the foreigner and for the resident alien, where anyone who has accidentally killed someöne can take sanctuary. </p>

<p>‘But if he has struck the person with an iron object so as to cause death, he is a murderer. The murderer will be put to death. If he has struck him with a stone meant for killing, and has killed him, he is a murderer. The murderer will be put to death. Or if he has struck him with a wooden instrument meant for killing, and has killed him, he is a murderer. The murderer will be put to death. The avenger of blood will put the murderer to death. Whenever he finds him, he will put him to death. </p>

<p>‘If the killer has maliciously manhandled his victim, or thrown some lethal missile to strike him down, or out of enmity dealt him the death-blow with his fist, then he who struck the blow will be put to death; he is a murderer; the avenger of blood will put him to death whenever he finds him. If, however, he has manhandled his victim by chance, without malice, or thrown some missile at him not meaning to hit him or, without seeing him, dropped on him a stone meant for killing and so killed him, so long as he bore him no malice and wished him no harm, then the community will decide in accordance with these rules between the one who struck the blow and the avenger of blood, and will save the killer from the clutches of the avenger of blood. They will send him back to the city of refuge where he had taken sanctuary, and there he will stay until the death of the high priest who has been anointed with the holy oil. Should the killer leave the bounds of the city of refuge in which he has taken sanctuary and the avenger of blood encounter him outside the bounds of his city of refuge, the avenger of blood may kill him without fear of reprisal; since the killer should stay in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest; only after the death of the high priest is he free to go back to his own piece of property. Such will be the legal rule for you and your descendants, wherever you may live. </p>

<p>‘In any case of homicide, the evidence of witnesses will determine whether the killer must be put to death; but a single witness is not enough to sustain a capital charge. You will not accept a ransom for the life of a murderer condemned to death; he must die. Nor will you accept a ransom for anyone who, having taken sanctuary in his city or refuge, wishes to come back and live at home before the death of the high priest. Do not profane the country you live in. Blood profanes the country and, for the country, the only expiation for the blood shed in it is the blood of the man who shed it. So do not defile the country which you live in and where I live; for I, Yahweh, live among the 
Israelites’”. </p>

<h4 id="ch36">A wife’s inheritance (36:1–12)</h4>

<p>Then the heads of families of the clan descended from Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, one of the clans descended from Joseph, came forward and, addressing Moses and the leaders, the Israelite heads of families, they said: </p>

<p>“Yahweh has ordered my lord to apportion the Israelites’ heritages in the country by lot and my lord has been ordered by Yahweh to give the heritage of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters. Now, if they marry someöne from another Israelite tribe, their heritage will be alienated from our ancestral heritage. The heritage of the tribe to which they will then belong will be increased, and the heritage allotted to us will be diminished. And when the jubilee for the Israelites comes around, these women’s heritage will become part of the heritage of the tribe to which they then belong, and be alienated from the heritage of our ancestral tribe”. </p>

<p>At Yahweh’s bidding, Moses gave the Israelites this order. He said: </p>

<p>“What the Josephite tribe says is true. This is Yahweh’s ruling for Zelophehad’s daughters: ‘They may marry whom they please, providing they marry into a clan of their father’s tribe. But the heritages of Israelites are not to be transferred from tribe to tribe; each Israelite will stick to the heritage of his own tribe. Any daughter who owns a heritage in an Israelite tribe will marry into a clan of her own paternal tribe, so that the Israelites may each preserve the heritage of his father. No heritage may be transferred from one tribe to another; each Israelite tribe will stick to its own heritage’”. </p>

<p>Zelophehad’s daughters did as Yahweh had ordered Moses. Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah and Noah, daughters of Zelophehad, married the sons of their father’s brothers. Since they married into clans descended from Manasseh son of Joseph, their heritage reverted to the tribe of their father’s clan. </p>

<h4>Conclusion (36:13)</h4>

<p>Such were the commandments and laws that Yahweh prescribed for the Israelites through Moses on the Plains of Moab near the Jordan by Jericho. </p>
