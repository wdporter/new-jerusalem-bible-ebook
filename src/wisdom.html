<h2 id="i">I: Wisdom and Human Destiny (1:1–5:23)</h2>

<h4>On seeking God and rejecting evil (1:1–15)</h4>

<p class="poem">
<span>Love uprightness you who are rulers on earth,</span><br />
<span>be properly disposed towards the Lord</span><br />
<span>and seek him in simplicity of heart;</span><br />
<span>for he will be found by those who do not put him to the test,</span><br />
<span>revealing himself to those who do not mistrust him.</span><br />
<span>Perverse thoughts, however, separate people from God,</span><br />
<span>and power, when put to the test, confounds the stupid.</span><br />
<span>Wisdom will never enter the soul of a wrong-doer,</span><br />
<span>nor dwell in a body enslaved to sin;</span><br />
<span>for the holy spirit of instruction flees deceitfulness,</span><br />
<span>recoils from unintelligent thoughts,</span><br />
<span>is thwarted by the onset of vice. </span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>Wisdom is a spirit friendly to humanity,</span><br />
<span>though she will not let a blasphemer’s words go unpunished;</span><br />
<span>since God observes the very soul</span><br />
<span>and accurately surveys the heart,</span><br />
<span>listening to every word.</span><br />
<span>For the spirit of the Lord fills the world,</span><br />
<span>and that which holds everything together knows every word said.</span><br />
<span>No one who speaks what is wrong will go undetected,</span><br />
<span>nor will avenging Justice pass by such a one.</span><br />
<span>For the schemes of the godless will be examined,</span><br />
<span>and a report of his words will reach the Lord</span><br />
<span>to convict him of his crimes.</span><br />
<span>There is a jealous ear that overhears everything,</span><br />
<span>not even a murmur of complaint escapes it.</span><br />
<span>So beware of uttering frivolous complaints,</span><br />
<span>restrain your tongue from finding fault;</span><br />
<span>even what is said in secret has repercussions,</span><br />
<span>and a lying mouth deals death to the soul. </span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>Do not court death by the errors of your ways,</span><br />
<span>nor invite destruction through the work of your hands.</span><br />
<span>For God did not make Death,</span><br />
<span>he takes no pleasure in destroying the living.</span><br />
<span>To exist — for this he created all things;</span><br />
<span>the creatures of the world have health in them,</span><br />
<span>in them is no fatal poison,</span><br />
<span>and Hades has no power over the world:</span><br />
<span>for uprightness is immortal. </span>
</p>

<h4>Life as the godless see it (1:16–2:20)</h4>

<p class="poem">
<span>But the godless call for Death with deed and word,</span><br />
<span>counting him friend, they wear themselves out for him;</span><br />
<span>with him they make a pact,</span><br />
<span>worthy as they are to belong to him. </span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>And this is the false argument they use,</span><br />
<span>“Our life is short and dreary,</span><br />
<span>there is no remedy when our end comes,</span><br />
<span>no one is known to have come back from Hades.</span><br />
<span>We came into being by chance</span><br />
<span>and afterwards shall be as though we had never been.</span><br />
<span>The breath in our nostrils is a puff of smoke,</span><br />
<span>reason a spark from the beating of our hearts;</span><br />
<span>extinguish this and the body turns to ashes,</span><br />
<span>and the spirit melts away like the yielding air.</span><br />
<span>In time, our name will be forgotten,</span><br />
<span>nobody will remember what we have done;</span><br />
<span>our life will pass away like wisps of cloud,</span><br />
<span>dissolving like the mist</span><br />
<span>that the sun’s rays drive away</span><br />
<span>and that its heat dispels.</span><br />
<span>For our days are the passing of a shadow,</span><br />
<span>our end is without return,</span><br />
<span>the seal is affixed and nobody comes back. </span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>“Come then, let us enjoy the good things of today,</span><br />
<span>let us use created things with the zest of youth:</span><br />
<span>take our fill of the dearest wines and perfumes,</span><br />
<span>on no account forgo the flowers of spring</span><br />
<span>but crown ourselves with rosebuds before they wither,</span><br />
<span>no meadow excluded from our orgy;</span><br />
<span>let us leave the signs of our revelry everywhere,</span><br />
<span>since this is our portion, this our lot! </span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>“As for the upright man who is poor, let us oppress him;</span><br />
<span>let us not spare the widow,</span><br />
<span>nor respect old age, white-haired with many years.</span><br />
<span>Let our might be the yardstick of right,</span><br />
<span>since weakness argues its own futility.</span><br />
<span>Let us lay traps for the upright man, since he annoys us</span><br />
<span>and opposes our way of life,</span><br />
<span>reproaches us for our sins against the Law,</span><br />
<span>and accuses us of sins against our upbringing.</span><br />
<span>He claims to have knowledge of God,</span><br />
<span>and calls himself a child of the Lord.</span><br />
<span>We see him as a reproof to our way of thinking,</span><br />
<span>the very sight of him weighs our spirits down;</span><br />
<span>for his kind of life is not like other people’s,</span><br />
<span>and his ways are quite different.</span><br />
<span>In his opinion we are counterfeit;</span><br />
<span>he avoids our ways as he would filth;</span><br />
<span>he proclaims the final end of the upright as blessed</span><br />
<span>and boasts of having God for his father.</span><br />
<span>Let us see if what he says is true,</span><br />
<span>and test him to see what sort of end he will have.</span><br />
<span>For if the upright man is God’s son, God will help him</span><br />
<span>and rescue him from the clutches of his enemies.</span><br />
<span>Let us test him with cruelty and with torture,</span><br />
<span>and thus explore this gentleness of his</span><br />
<span>and put his patience to the test.</span><br />
<span>Let us condemn him to a shameful death</span><br />
<span>since God will rescue him — or so he claims”. </span>
</p>

<h4>Error of the godless (2:21–24)</h4>

<p class="poem">
<span>This is the way they reason, but they are misled,</span><br />
<span>since their malice makes them blind.</span><br />
<span>They do not know the hidden things of God,</span><br />
<span>they do not hope for the reward of holiness,</span><br />
<span>they do not believe in a reward for blameless souls.</span><br />
<span>For God created human beings to be immortal,</span><br />
<span>he made them as an image of his own nature;</span><br />
<span>Death came into the world only through the Devil’s envy,</span><br />
<span>as those who belong to him find to their cost. </span>
</p>

<h4>Destinies of the good and bad compared (3:1–12)</h4>

<p class="poem">
<span>But the souls of the upright are in the hands of God,</span><br />
<span>and no torment can touch them.</span><br />
<span>To the unenlightened, they appeared to die,</span><br />
<span>their departure was regarded as disaster,</span><br />
<span>their leaving us like annihilation;</span><br />
<span>but they are at peace.</span><br />
<span>If, as it seemed to us, they suffered punishment,</span><br />
<span>their hope was rich with immortality;</span><br />
<span>slight was their correction, great will their blessings be.</span><br />
<span>God was putting them to the test</span><br />
<span>and has proved them worthy to be with him;</span><br />
<span>he has tested them like gold in a furnace,</span><br />
<span>and accepted them as a perfect burnt offering.</span><br />
<span>At their time of visitation, they will shine out;</span><br />
<span>as sparks run through the stubble, so will they.</span><br />
<span>They will judge nations, rule over peoples,</span><br />
<span>and the Lord will be their king for ever.</span><br />
<span>Those who trust in him will understand the truth,</span><br />
<span>those who are faithful will live with him in love;</span><br />
<span>for grace and mercy await his holy ones,</span><br />
<span>and he intervenes on behalf of his chosen. </span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>But the godless will be duly punished for their reasoning,</span><br />
<span>for having neglected the upright and deserted the Lord.</span><br />
<span>Yes, wretched are they who scorn wisdom and discipline:</span><br />
<span>their hope is void,</span><br />
<span>their toil unavailing,</span><br />
<span>their achievements unprofitable;</span><br />
<span>their wives are reckless,</span><br />
<span>their children depraved,</span><br />
<span>their descendants accursed. </span>
</p>

<h4>Better be sterile than have godless children (3:13–4:6)</h4>

<p class="poem">
<span>Blessed the sterile woman if she be blameless,</span><br />
<span>and has not known an unlawful bed,</span><br />
<span>for she will have fruit at the visitation of souls.</span><br />
<span>Blessed, too, the eunuch whose hand commits no crime,</span><br />
<span>and who harbours no resentment against the Lord:</span><br />
<span>a special favour will be granted to him for his loyalty,</span><br />
<span>a most desirable portion in the temple of the Lord.</span><br />
<span>For the fruit of honest labours is glorious,</span><br />
<span>and the root of understanding does not decay.</span><br />
<span>But the children of adulterers will not reach maturity,</span><br />
<span>the offspring of an unlawful bed will disappear.</span><br />
<span>Even if they live long, they will count for nothing,</span><br />
<span>their old age will go unhonoured at the last;</span><br />
<span>while if they die early, they have neither hope</span><br />
<span>nor comfort on the day of judgement,</span><br />
<span>for the end of a race of evil-doers is harsh.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>Better to have no children yet to have virtue,</span><br />
<span>since immortality perpetuates its memory;</span><br />
<span>for God and human beings both recognise it.</span><br />
<span>Present, we imitate it,</span><br />
<span>absent, we long for it;</span><br />
<span>crowned, it holds triumph through eternity,</span><br />
<span>having striven for untainted prizes and emerged the victor. </span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
<span>But the offspring of the godless come to nothing, however prolific,</span><br />
<span>sprung from a bastard stock, they will never strike deep roots,</span><br />
<span>never put down firm foundations.</span><br />
<span>They may branch out for a time,</span><br />
<span>but, on unsteady foundations, they will be rocked by the wind</span><br />
<span>and uprooted by the force of the storm;</span><br />
<span>their branches, yet unformed, will be snapped off,</span><br />
<span>their fruit be useless,</span><br />
<span>too unripe to eat,</span><br />
<span>fit for nothing.</span><br />
<span>For children begotten of unlawful bed</span><br />
<span>witness, when put on trial, to their parents’ wickedness. </span>
</p>

<h4>The premature death of the upright (4:7–19)</h4>

<p class="poem">
<span>The upright, though he die before his time, will find rest.</span><br />
<span>Length of days is not what makes age honourable,</span><br />
<span>nor number of years the true measure of life;</span><br />
<span>understanding, this is grey hairs,</span><br />
<span>untarnished life, this is ripe old age.</span><br />
<span>Having won God’s favour, he has been loved</span><br />
<span>and, as he was living among sinners, has been taken away.</span><br />
<span>He has been carried off so that evil may not warp</span><br />
<span>his understanding or deceitfulness seduce his soul;</span><br />
<span>for the fascination of evil throws good things into the shade,</span><br />
<span>and the whirlwind of desire corrupts a simple heart.</span><br />
<span>Having come to perfection so soon, he has lived long;</span><br />
<span>his soul being pleasing to the Lord,</span><br />
<span>he has hurried away from the wickedness around him. </span>
</p> 

<p class="poem">
<span>Yet people look on, uncomprehending;</span><br />
<span>and it does not enter their heads</span><br />
<span>that grace and mercy await his chosen ones</span><br />
<span>and that he intervenes on behalf of his holy ones.</span><br />
<span>The upright who dies condemns the godless who survive,</span><br />
<span>and youth quickly perfected condemns the lengthy old age of the wicked.</span><br />
<span>These people see the end of the wise</span><br />
<span>without understanding what the Lord has in store</span><br />
<span>or why he has taken such a one to safety;</span><br />
<span>they look on and sneer,</span><br />
<span>but the Lord will laugh at them.</span><br />
<span>Soon they will be corpses without honour,</span><br />
<span>objects of horror among the dead for ever.</span><br />
<span>For he will shatter them and fling them headlong and dumbfounded.</span><br />
<span>He will shake them from their foundations;</span><br />
<span>they will be utterly laid waste,</span><br />
<span>a prey to grief,</span><br />
<span>and their memory will perish. </span>
</p>

<h4>The godless called to judgement (4:20–5:14)</h4>

<p class="poem">
<span>When the count of their sins has been drawn up, in terror they will come, 
and their crimes, confronting them, will accuse them. 



Wis 5:1 Then the upright will stand up boldly to face those who had oppressed him and had thought so little of
his sufferings.

Wis 5:2 And, seeing him, they will be seized with terrible fear, amazed that he should have been so
unexpectedly saved.

Wis 5:3 Stricken with remorse, they will say to one another with groans and labouring breath,

Wis 5:4 “This is the one whom we used to mock, making him the butt of our insults, fools that we were! His life
we regarded as madness, his ending as without honour.

Wis 5:5 How has he come to be counted as one of the children of God and to have his lot among the holy ones?
Wis 5:6 Clearly we have strayed from the way of truth; the light of justice has not shone for us, the sun has not
risen for us.

Wis 5:7 We have left no path of lawlessness or ruin unexplored, we have crossed deserts where there was no
track, but the way of the Lord is one we have never known.

Wis 5:8 What good has arrogance been to us? What has been the purpose of our riches and boastfulness?

Wis 5:9 All those things have passed like a shadow, passed like a fleeting rumour.

Wis 5:10 Like a ship that cuts through heaving waves — leaving no trace to show where it has passed, no wake
from its keel in the waves.

Wis 5:1 1 Or like a bird flying through the air — leaving no proof of its passing; it whips the light air with the stroke
of its pinions, tears it apart in its whirring rush, drives its way onward with sweeping wing, and afterwards no sign
is seen of its passage.

Wis 5:12 Or like an arrow shot at a mark, the pierced air closing so quickly on itself, there is no knowing which
way the arrow has passed.

Wis 5:13 So with us: scarcely born, we disappear; of virtue not a trace have we to show, we have spent
ourselves in our own wickedness!”.
</span>
</p>

Wis 5:14 For the hope of the godless is like chaff carried on the wind, like fine spray driven by the storm; it
disperses like smoke before the wind, goes away like the memory of a one-day guest.

Wis 5:15 But the upright live for ever, their recompense is with the Lord, and the Most High takes care of them.
Wis 5:16 So they will receive the glorious crown and the diadem of beauty from the Lord’s hand; for he will
shelter them with his right hand and with his arm he will shield them.

Wis 5:17 For armour he will take his jealous love, he will arm creation to punish his enemies;

Wis 5:18 he will put on justice as a breastplate, and for helmet wear his forthright judgement;

Wis 5:19 he will take up invincible holiness for shield,

Wis 5:20 of his pitiless wrath he will forge a sword, and the universe will march with him to fight the reckless.

Wis 5:21 Bolts truly aimed, the shafts of lightning will leap, and from the clouds, as from a full-drawn bow, fly to
their mark;

Wis 5:22 and the catapult will hurl hailstones charged with fury. The waters of the sea will rage against them,
the rivers engulf them without pity,

Wis 5:23 a mighty gale will rise against them and winnow them like a hurricane. Thus wickedness will lay the
whole earth waste and evil-doing bring down the thrones of the mighty.

Wis 6:1 Listen then, kings, and understand; rulers of remotest lands, take warning;

Wis 6:2 hear this, you who govern great populations, taking pride in your hosts of subject nations!

Wis 6:3 For sovereignty is given to you by the Lord and power by the Most High, who will himself probe your
acts and scrutinise your intentions.

Wis 6:4 If therefore, as servants of his kingdom, you have not ruled justly nor observed the law, nor followed the
will of God,

Wis 6:5 he will fall on you swiftly and terribly. On the highly placed a ruthless judgement falls;

Wis 6:6 the lowly are pardoned, out of pity, but the mighty will be mightily tormented.

Wis 6:7 For the Lord of all does not cower before anyone, he does not stand in awe of greatness, since he
himself has made small and great and provides for all alike;

Wis 6:8 but a searching trial awaits those who wield power.

Wis 6:9 So, monarchs, my words are meant for you, so that you may learn wisdom and not fall into error;

Wis 6:10 for those who in holiness observe holy things will be adjudged holy, and, accepting instruction from
them, will find their defence in them.

Wis 6:1 1 Set your heart, therefore, on what I have to say, listen with a will, and you will be instructed.

Wis 6:12 Wisdom is brilliant, she never fades. By those who love her, she is readily seen, by those who seek
her, she is readily found.

Wis 6:13 She anticipates those who desire her by making herself known first.

Wis 6:14 Whoëver gets up early to seek her will have no trouble but will find her sitting at the door.

Wis 6: 1 5 Meditating on her is understanding in its perfect form, and anyone keeping awake for her will soon be
free from care.



Wis 6:16 For she herself searches everywhere for those who are worthy of her, benevolently appearing to them
on their ways, anticipating their every thought.

Wis 6:17 For Wisdom begins with the sincere desire for instruction, care for instruction means loving her,

Wis 6:18 loving her means keeping her laws, attention to her laws guarantees incorruptibility,

Wis 6:19 and incorruptibility brings us near to God;

Wis 6:20 the desire for Wisdom thus leads to sovereignty.

Wis 6:21 If then thrones and sceptres delight you, monarchs of the nations, honour Wisdom, so that you may
reign for ever.

Wis 6:22 What Wisdom is and how she was born, I shall now explain; I shall hide no mysteries from you, but
shall follow her steps from the outset of her origin, setting out what we know of her in full light, without departing
from the truth.

Wis 6:23 Blighting envy is no companion for me, for envy has nothing in common with Wisdom.

Wis 6:24 In the greatest number of the wise lies the world’s salvation, in a sagacious king the stability of a
people.

Wis 6:25 Learn, therefore, from my words; the gain will be yours.

Wis 7:1 I too am mortal like everyone else, a descendant of the first man formed from the earth. I was modelled
in flesh inside a mother’s womb,

Wis 7:2 where, for ten months, in blood I acquired substance — the result of virile seed and pleasure, sleep’s
companion.

Wis 7:3 I too, when I was born, drew in the common air, I fell on the same ground that bears us all, and crying
was the first sound I made, like everyone else.

Wis 7:4 I was nurtured in swaddling clothes, with every care.

Wis 7:5 No king has known any other beginning of existence;

Wis 7:6 for there is only one way into life, and one way out of it.

Wis 7:7 And so I prayed, and understanding was given me; I entreated, and the spirit of Wisdom came to me.
Wis 7:8 I esteemed her more than sceptres and thrones; compared with her, I held riches as nothing.

Wis 7:9 I reckoned no precious stone to be her equal, for compared with her, all gold is a pinch of sand, and
beside her, silver ranks as mud.

Wis 7:10 I loved her more than health or beauty, preferred her to the light, since her radiance never sleeps.

Wis 7:1 1 In her company all good things came to me, and at her hands incalculable wealth.

Wis 7:12 All these delighted me, since Wisdom brings them, though I did not then realise that she was their
mother.

Wis 7:13 What I learned diligently, I shall pass on liberally, I shall not conceal how rich she is.

Wis 7:14 For she is to human beings an inexhaustible treasure, and those who acquire this win God’s
friendship, commended to him by the gifts of instruction.

Wis 7:15 May God grant me to speak as he would wish and conceive thoughts worthy of the gifts I have
received, since he is both guide to Wisdom and director of sages;

Wis 7:16 for we are in his hand, yes, ourselves and our sayings, and all intellectual and all practical knowledge.
Wis 7:17 He it was who gave me sure knowledge of what exists, to understand the structure of the world and
the action of the elements,

Wis 7:18 the beginning, end and middle of the times, the alternation of the solstices and the succession of the
seasons,

Wis 7:19 the cycles of the year and the position of the stars,

Wis 7:20 the natures of animals and the instincts of wild beasts, the powers of spirits and human mental
processes, the varieties of plants and the medical properties of roots.

Wis 7:21 And now I understand everything, hidden or visible, for Wisdom, the designer of all things, has
instructed me.

Wis 7:22 For within her is a spirit intelligent, holy, unique, manifold, subtle, mobile, incisive, unsullied, lucid,
invulnerable, benevolent, shrewd,

Wis 7:23 irresistible, beneficent, friendly to human beings, steadfast, dependable, unperturbed, almighty, all-
surveying, penetrating all intelligent, pure and most subtle spirits.

Wis 7:24 For Wisdom is quicker to move than any motion; she is so pure, she pervades and permeates all
things.

Wis 7:25 She is a breath of the power of God, pure emanation of the glory of the Almighty; so nothing impure
can find its way into her.

Wis 7:26 For she is a reflection of the eternal light, untarnished mirror of God’s active power, and image of his
goodness.

Wis 7:27 Although she is alone, she can do everything; herself unchanging, she renews the world, and,
generation after generation, passing into holy souls, she makes them into God’s friends and prophets;



Wis 7:28 for God loves only those who dwell with Wisdom.

Wis 7:29 She is indeed more splendid than the sun, she outshines all the constellations; compared with light,
she takes first place,

Wis 7:30 for light must yield to night, but against Wisdom evil cannot prevail.

Wis 8:1 Strongly she reaches from one end of the world to the other and she governs the whole world for its
good.

Wis 8:2 Wisdom I loved and searched for from my youth; I resolved to have her as my bride, I fell in love with
her beauty.

Wis 8:3 She enhances her noble birth by sharing God’s life, for the Master of All has always loved her.

Wis 8:4 Indeed, she shares the secrets of God’s knowledge, and she chooses what he will do.

Wis 8:5 If in this life wealth is a desirable possession, what is more wealthy than Wisdom whose work is
everywhere?

Wis 8:6 Or if it be the intellect that is at work, who, more than she, designs whatever exists?

Wis 8:7 Or if it be uprightness you love, why, virtues are the fruit of her labours, since it is she who teaches
temperance and prudence, justice and fortitude; nothing in life is more useful for human beings.

Wis 8:8 Or if you are eager for wide experience, she knows the past, she forecasts the future; she knows how to
turn maxims, and solve riddles; she has foreknowledge of signs and wonders, and of the unfolding of the ages
and the times.

Wis 8:9 I therefore determined to take her to share my life, knowing that she would be my counsellor in
prosperity and comfort me in cares and sorrow.

Wis 8:10 “Thanks to her, I shall be admired by the masses and honoured, though young, by the elders.

Wis 8:1 1 I shall be reckoned shrewd as a judge, and the great will be amazed at me.

Wis 8:12 They will wait on my silences, and pay attention when I speak; if I speak at some length, they will lay
their hand on their lips.

Wis 8:13 By means of her, immortality will be mine, I shall leave an everlasting memory to my successors.

Wis 8:14 I shall govern peoples, and nations will be subject to me;

Wis 8:15 at the sound of my name fearsome despots will be afraid; I shall show myself kind to the people and
valiant in battle.

Wis 8:16 “When I go home I shall take my ease with her, for nothing is bitter in her company, when life is shared
with her there is no pain, nothing but pleasure and joy”.

Wis 8:17 Having meditated on all this, and having come to the conclusion that immortality resides in kinship with
Wisdom,

Wis 8:18 noble contentment in her friendship, inexhaustible riches in her activities, understanding in cultivating
her society, and renown in conversing with her, I went all ways, seeking how to get her.

Wis 8:19 I was a boy of happy disposition, I had received a good soul as my lot,

Wis 8:20 or rather, being good, I had entered an undefiled body;

Wis 8:21 but, realising that I could never possess Wisdom unless God gave her to me, -a sign of intelligence in
itself, to know in whose gift she lay — 1 prayed to the Lord and entreated him, and with all my heart I said:

Wis 9:1 “God of our ancestors, Lord of mercy, who by your word have made the universe,

Wis 9:2 and in your wisdom have fitted human beings to rule the creatures that you have made,

Wis 9:3 to govern the world in holiness and saving justice and in honesty of soul to dispense fair judgement,

Wis 9:4 grant me Wisdom, consort of your throne, and do not reject me from the number of your children.

Wis 9:5 For I am your servant, son of your serving maid, a feeble man, with little time to live, with small

understanding of justice and the laws.

Wis 9:6 Indeed, were anyone perfect among the sons of men, if he lacked the Wisdom that comes from you, he
would still count for nothing.

Wis 9:7 “You have chosen me to be king over your people, to be judge of your sons and daughters.

Wis 9:8 You have bidden me build a temple on your holy mountain, and an altar in the city where you have
pitched your tent, a copy of the holy Tent which you prepared at the beginning.

Wis 9:9 With you is Wisdom, she who knows your works, she who was present when you made the world; she
understands what is pleasing in your eyes and what agrees with your commandments.

Wis 9:10 Despatch her from the holy heavens, send her forth from your throne of glory to help me and to toil
with me and teach me what is pleasing to you;

Wis 9:1 1 since she knows and understands everything she will guide me prudently in my actions and will protect
me with her glory.

Wis 9: 1 2 Then all I do will be acceptable, I shall govern your people justly and be worthy of my father’s throne.
Wis 9:13 “What human being indeed can know the intentions of God? And who can comprehend the will of the
Lord?

Wis 9:14 For the reasoning of mortals is inadequate, our attitudes of mind unstable;



Wis 9: 15 for a perishable body presses down the soul, and this tent of clay weighs down the mind with its many
cares.

Wis 9:16 It is hard enough for us to work out what is on earth, laborious to know what lies within our reach; who,
then, can discover what is in the heavens?

Wis 9:17 And who could ever have known your will, had you not given Wisdom and sent your holy Spirit from
above?

Wis 9:18 Thus have the paths of those on earth been straightened and people have been taught what pleases
you, and have been saved, by Wisdom”.

Wis 10:1 It was Wisdom who protected the first man to be fashioned, the father of the world, who had been
created all alone, she it was who rescued him from his fall
Wis 10:2 and gave him the strength to subjugate all things.

Wis 10:3 But when in his wrath a wicked man deserted her, he perished in his fratricidal fury.

Wis 10:4 When because of him the earth was drowned, it was Wisdom again who saved it, piloting the upright
man on valueless timber.

Wis 10:5 Again, when, concurring in wickedness, the nations had been thrown into confusion, she singled out
the upright man, preserved him blameless before God and fortified him against pity for his child.

Wis 10:6 She it was who, while the godless perished, saved the upright man as he fled from the fire raining
down on the Five Cities,

Wis 10:7 in witness against whose evil ways a desolate land still smokes, where plants bear fruit that never
ripens and where, monument to an unbelieving soul, there stands a pillar of salt.

Wis 10:8 For, by ignoring the path of Wisdom, not only did they suffer the loss of not knowing the good, but they
left the world a memorial to their folly, so that their offences could not pass unnoticed.

Wis 10:9 But Wisdom delivered her servants from their ordeals.

Wis 10:10 The upright man, fleeing from the anger of his brother, was led by her along straight paths. She
showed him the kingdom of God and taught him the knowledge of holy things. She brought him success in his
labours and gave him full return for all his efforts;

Wis 10:11 she stood by him against grasping and oppressive men and she made him rich.

Wis 10:12 She preserved him from his enemies and saved him from the traps they set for him. In an arduous
struggle she awarded him the prize, to teach him that piety is stronger than all.

Wis 10:13 She did not forsake the upright man when he was sold, but snatched him away from sin;

Wis 10:14 she accompanied him down into the pit, nor did she abandon him in his chains until she had brought
him the sceptre of a kingdom and authority over his despotic masters, thus exposing as liars those who had
traduced him, and giving him honour everlasting.

Wis 10:15 It was Wisdom who delivered a holy people, a blameless race, from a nation of oppressors.

Wis 10:16 She entered the soul of a servant of the Lord, and withstood fearsome kings with wonders and signs.
Wis 10:17 To the holy people she gave the wages of their labours; she guided them by a marvellous road,
herself their shelter by day — and their starlight through the night.

Wis 10:18 She brought them across the Red Sea, leading them through an immensity of water,

Wis 10:19 whereäs she drowned their enemies, then spat them out from the depths of the abyss.

Wis 10:20 So the upright despoiled the godless; Lord, they extolled your holy name, and with one accord
praised your protecting hand;

Wis 10:21 for Wisdom opened the mouths of the dumb and made eloquent the tongues of babes.

Wis 11:1 She made their actions successful, by means of a holy prophet.

Wis 1 1 :2 They journeyed through an unpeopled desert and pitched their tents in inaccessible places.

Wis 1 1 :3 They stood firm against their enemies, fought off their foes.

Wis 1 1 :4 On you they called when they were thirsty, and from the rocky cliff water was given them, from hard
stone a remedy for their thirst.

Wis 1 1 :5 Thus, what had served to punish their enemies became a benefit for them in their difficulties.

Wis 1 1 :6 Whereäs their enemies had only the ever-flowing source of a river fouled with mingled blood and mud,
Wis 11:7 to punish them for their decree of infanticide, you gave your people, against all hope, water in
abundance,

Wis 1 1 :8 once you had shown by the thirst that they were experiencing how severely you were punishing their
enemies.

Wis 1 1 :9 From their own ordeals, which were only loving correction, they realised how an angry sentence was
tormenting the godless;

Wis 11:10 for you had tested your own as a father admonishes, but the others you had punished as a pitiless
king condemns,

Wis 11:11 and, whether far or near, they were equally afflicted.

Wis 11:12 For a double sorrow seized on them, and a groaning at the memory of the past;



Wis 11:13 when they learned that the punishments they were receiving were beneficial to the others, they
realised it was the Lord,

Wis 11:14 while for the man whom long before they had exposed and later mockingly rebuffed, they felt only
admiration when all was done, having suffered a thirst so different from that of the upright.

Wis 11:15 For their foolish and wicked notions which led them astray into worshipping mindless reptiles and
contemptible beetles, you sent a horde of mindless animals to punish them
Wis 11:16 and to teach them that the agent of sin is the agent of punishment.

Wis 11:17 And indeed your all-powerful hand which created the world from formless matter, did not lack means
to unleash a horde of bears or savage lions on them

Wis 11:18 or unknown beasts, newly created, full of rage, breathing out fire, or puffing out stinking smoke, or
flashing fearful sparks from their eyes,

Wis 11:19 beasts able not only to destroy them, being so savage, but even to strike them dead by their terrifying
appearance.

Wis 1 1 :20 Flowever, without these, one breath could have blown them over, pursued by Justice, whirled away
by the breath of your power. You, however, ordered all things by measure, number and weight.

Wis 1 1 :21 For your great power is always at your service, and who can withstand the might of your arm?

Wis 1 1 :22 The whole world, for you, can no more than tip a balance, like a drop of morning dew falling on the
ground.

Wis 1 1 :23 Yet you are merciful to all, because you are almighty, you overlook people’s sins, so that they can
repent.

Wis 1 1 :24 Yes, you love everything that exists, and nothing that you have made disgusts you, since, if you had
hated something, you would not have made it.

Wis 1 1 :25 And how could a thing subsist, had you not willed it? Or how be preserved, if not called forth by you?
Wis 1 1 :26 No, you spare all, since all is yours, Lord, lover of life!

Wis 12:1 For your imperishable spirit is in everything!

Wis 12:2 And thus, gradually, you correct those who offend; you admonish and remind them of how they have
sinned, so that they may abstain from evil and trust in you, Lord.

Wis 12:3 The ancient inhabitants of your holy land

Wis 12:4 you hated for their loathsome practices, their acts of sorcery, and unholy rites.

Wis 12:5 Those ruthless murderers of children, those eaters of entrails at feasts of human flesh and of blood,
those initiates of secret brotherhoods,

Wis 12:6 those murderous parents of defenceless beings, you determined to destroy at our ancestors’ hands,
Wis 12:7 so that this land, dearer to you than any other, might receive a worthy colony of God’s children.

Wis 12:8 Even so, since these were human, you treated them leniently, sending hornets as forerunners of your
army, to exterminate them little by little.

Wis 12:9 Not that you were unable to hand the godless over to the upright in pitched battle or destroy them at
once by savage beasts or one harsh word;

Wis 12:10 but, by carrying out your sentences gradually, you gave them a chance to repent, although you knew
that they were inherently evil, innately wicked,

Wis 12:11 and fixed in their cast of mind; for they were a race accursed from the beginning. Nor was it from awe
of anyone that you let their sins go unpunished.

Wis 12:12 For who is there to ask, “What have you done?”. Or who is there to disagree with your sentence? Who
to arraign you for destroying nations which you have created? Who to confront you by championing the wicked?
Wis 12:13 For there is no god, other than you, who cares for every one, to whom you have to prove that your
sentences have been just.

Wis 12:14 No more could any king or despot challenge you over those whom you have punished.

Wis 12:15 For, being upright yourself, you rule the universe uprightly, and hold it as incompatible with your
power to condemn anyone who has not deserved to be punished.

Wis 12:16 For your strength is the basis of your saving justice, and your sovereignty over all makes you lenient
to all.

Wis 12:17 You show your strength when people will not believe in your absolute power, and you confound any
insolence in those who do know it.

Wis 12:18 But you, controlling your strength, are mild in judgement, and govern us with great lenience, for you
have only to will, and your power is there.

Wis 12:19 By acting thus, you have taught your people that the upright must be kindly to his fellows, and you
have given your children the good hope that after sins you will grant repentance.

Wis 12:20 For, if with such care and indulgence you have punished your children’s enemies, though doomed to
death, and have given them time and place to be rid of their wickedness,

Wis 12:21 with what exact attention have you not judged your children, to whose ancestors, by oaths and



covenants, you made such generous promises?

Wis 12:22 Thus, you instruct us, when you punish our enemies in moderation, that we should reflect on your
kindness when we judge, and, when we are judged, we should look for mercy.

Wis 12:23 And this is why people leading foolish and wicked lives were tortured by you with their own
abominations;

Wis 12:24 for they had strayed too far on the paths of error by taking the vilest and most despicable of animals
for gods, being deluded like silly little children.

Wis 12:25 So, as to children with no sense, you gave them a sentence making fools of them.

Wis 12:26 Those, however, who would not take warning from a mocking reproof were soon to endure a
sentence worthy of God.

Wis 12:27 The creatures that made them suffer and against which they protested, those very creatures that they
had taken for gods and by which they were punished they saw in their true light; and he whom hitherto they had
refused to know, they realised was true God. And this is why the final condemnation fell on them.

Wis 13:1 Yes, naturally stupid are all who are unaware of God, and who, from good things seen, have not been
able to discover Him-who-is, or, by studying the works, have not recognised the Artificer.

Wis 13:2 Fire, however, or wind, or the swift air, the sphere of the stars, impetuous water, heaven’s lamps, are
what they have held to be the gods who govern the world.

Wis 13:3 If, charmed by their beauty, they have taken these for gods, let them know how much the Master of
these excels them, since he was the very source of beauty that created them.

Wis 13:4 And if they have been impressed by their power and energy, let them deduce from these how much
mightier is he that has formed them,

Wis 13:5 since through the grandeur and beauty of the creatures we may, by analogy, contemplate their Author.
Wis 13:6 Small blame, however, attaches to them, for perhaps they go astray only in their search for God and
their eagerness to find him;

Wis 13:7 familiar with his works, they investigate them and fall victim to appearances, seeing so much beauty.
Wis 13:8 But even so, they have no excuse:

Wis 13:9 if they are capable of acquiring enough knowledge to be able to investigate the world, how have they
been so slow to find its Master?

Wis 13:10 But wretched are they, with their hopes set on dead things, who have given the title of gods to human
artefacts, gold or silver, skilfully worked, figures of animals, or useless stone, carved by some hand long ago.

Wis 13:1 1 Take a woodcutter. He fells a suitable tree, neatly strips off the bark all over and then with admirable
skill works the wood into an object useful in daily life.

Wis 13:12 The bits left over from his work he uses for cooking his food, then eats his fill.

Wis 13:13 There is still a good-for-nothing bit left over, a gnarled and knotted billet: he takes it and whittles it
with the concentration of his leisure hours, he shapes it with the skill of experience, he gives it a human shape
Wis 13:14 or perhaps he makes it into some vile animal, smears it with ochre, paints its surface red, coats over
all its blemishes.

Wis 13:15 He next makes a worthy home for it, lets it into the wall, fixes it with an iron clamp.

Wis 13:16 Thus he makes sure that it will not fall down — being well aware that it cannot help itself, since it is
only an image, and needs to be helped.

Wis 13:17 And yet, if he wishes to pray for his goods, for his marriage, for his children, he does not blush to
harangue this lifeless thing — for health, he invokes what is weak,

Wis 13:18 for life, he pleads with what is dead, for help, he goes begging to total inexperience, for a journey,
what cannot even use its feet,

Wis 13:19 for profit, an undertaking, and success in pursuing his craft, he asks skill from something whose
hands have no skill whatever.

Wis 14:1 Or someöne else, taking ship to cross the wild waves, loudly invokes a piece of wood frailer than the
vessel that bears him.

Wis 14:2 Agreed, the ship is the product of a craving for gain, its building embodies the wisdom of the
shipwright;

Wis 14:3 but your providence, Father, is what steers it, you having opened a pathway even through the sea, and
a safe way over the waves,

Wis 14:4 showing that you can save, whatever happens, so that, even without experience, someöne may put to
sea.

Wis 14:5 It is not your will that the works of your Wisdom should be sterile, so people entrust their lives to the
smallest piece of wood, cross the waves on a raft, yet are kept safe and sound.

Wis 14:6 Why, in the beginning, when the proud giants were perishing, the hope of the world took refuge on a
raft and, steered by your hand, preserved the seed of a new generation for the ages to come.

Wis 14:7 For blessed is the wood which serves the cause of uprightness



Wis 14:8 but accursed the man-made idol, yes, it and its maker, he for having made it, and it because, though
perishable, it has been called god.

Wis 14:9 For God holds the godless and his godlessness in equal hatred;

Wis 14:10 both work and workman will alike be punished.

Wis 14:11 Hence even the idols of the nations will have a visitation since, in God’s creation, they have become
an abomination, a scandal for human souls, a snare for the feet of the foolish.

Wis 14:12 The idea of making idols was the origin of fornication, their discovery corrupted life.

Wis 14:13 They did not exist at the beginning, they will not exist for ever;

Wis 14:14 human vanity brought them into the world, and a quick end is therefore reserved for them.

Wis 14:15 A father afflicted by untimely mourning has an image made of his child so soon carried off, and now
pays divine honours to what yesterday was only a corpse, handing on mysteries and ceremonies to his people;
Wis 14:16 time passes, the custom hardens and is observed as law.

Wis 14:17 Rulers were the ones who ordered that statues should be worshipped: people who could not honour
them in person, because they lived too far away, would have a portrait made of their distant countenance, to
have an image that they could see of the king whom they honoured; meaning, by such zeal, to flatter the absent
as if he were present.

Wis 14:18 Even people who did not know him were stimulated into spreading his cult by the artist’s enthusiasm;
Wis 14:19 for the latter, doubtless wishing to please his ruler, exerted all his skill to surpass the reality,

Wis 14:20 and the crowd, attracted by the beauty of the work, mistook for a god someöne whom recently they
had honoured as a man.

Wis 14:21 And this became a snare for life: that people, whether enslaved by misfortune or by tyranny, should
have conferred the ineffable Name on sticks and stones.

Wis 14:22 It is not enough, however, for them to have such misconceptions about God; for, living in the fierce
warfare of ignorance, they call these terrible evils peace.

Wis 14:23 With their child-murdering rites, their occult mysteries, or their frenzied orgies with outlandish
customs,

Wis 14:24 they no longer retain any purity in their lives or their marriages, one treacherously murdering another
or wronging him by adultery.

Wis 14:25 Everywhere a welter of blood and murder, theft and fraud, corruption, treachery, riot, perjury,

Wis 14:26 disturbance of decent people, forgetfulness of favours, pollution of souls, sins against nature,
disorder in marriage, adultery and debauchery.

Wis 14:27 For the worship of idols with no name is the beginning, cause, and end of every evil.

Wis 14:28 For these people either carry their merrymaking to the point of frenzy, or they prophesy what is not
true, or they live wicked lives, or they perjure themselves without hesitation;

Wis 14:29 since they put their trust in lifeless idols they do not reckon their false oaths can harm them.

Wis 14:30 But they will be justly punished for this double crime: for degrading the concept of God by adhering to
idols; and for wickedly perjuring themselves in contempt for what is holy.

Wis 14:31 For it is not the power of the things by which they swear but the punishment reserved for sinners that
always follows the offences of wicked people.

Wis 15:1 But you, our God, are kind and true, slow to anger, governing the universe with mercy.

Wis 15:2 Even if we sin, we are yours, since we acknowledge your power, but we will not sin, knowing we count
as yours.

Wis 15:3 To know you is indeed the perfect virtue, and to know your power is the root of immortality.

Wis 15:4 We have not been duped by inventions of misapplied human skill, or by the sterile work of painters, by
figures daubed with assorted colours,

Wis 15:5 the sight of which sets fools yearning and hankering for the lifeless form of an unbreathing image.

Wis 15:6 Lovers of evil and worthy of such hopes are those who make them, those who want them and those
who worship them.

Wis 15:7 Take a potter, now, laboriously working the soft earth, shaping each object for us to use. Out of the
self-same clay, he models vessels intended for a noble use and those for a contrary purpose, all alike: but which
of these two uses each will have is for the potter himself to decide.

Wis 15:8 Then — ill — spent effortl-from the same clay he models a futile god, although so recently made out of
earth himself and shortly to return to what he was taken from, when asked to give back the soul that has been
lent to him.

Wis 15:9 Even so, he does not worry about having to die or about the shortness of his life, but strives to outdo
the goldsmiths and silversmiths, imitates the bronzeworkers, and prides himself on modelling counterfeits.

Wis 15:10 Ashes, his heart; more vile than earth, his hope; more wretched than clay, his life!

Wis 15:11 For he has misconceived the One who has modelled him, who breathed an active soul into him and
inspired a living spirit.



Wis 15:12 What is more, he looks on this life of ours as a kind of game, and our time here like a fair, full of
bargains. “However foul the means”, he says, “a man must make a living”.

Wis 15:13 He, more than any other, knows he is sinning, he who from one earthy stuff makes both brittle pots
and idols.

Wis 15:14 But most foolish, more pitiable even than the soul of a little child, are the enemies who once played
the tyrant with your people,

Wis 15:15 and have taken all the idols of the heathen for gods; these can use neither their eyes for seeing nor
their nostrils for breathing the air nor their ears for hearing nor the fingers on their hands for handling nor their
feet for walking.

Wis 15:16 They have been made, you see, by a human being, modelled by a being whose own breath is
borrowed. No man can model a god to resemble himself;

Wis 15:17 subject to death, his impious hands can produce only something dead. He himself is worthier than
the things he worships; he will at least have lived, but never they.

Wis 15:18 And they worship even the most loathsome of animals, worse than the rest in their degree of
stupidity,

Wis 15:19 without a trace of beauty — if that is what is attractive in animals- and excluded from God’s praises
and blessing.

Wis 16:1 Thus they were appropriately punished by similar creatures and tormented by swarms of vermin.

Wis 16:2 In contrast to this punishment, you did your people a kindness and, to satisfy their sharp appetite,
provided quails — a luscious rarity — for them to eat.

Wis 16:3 Thus the Egyptians, at the repulsive sight of the creatures sent against them, were to find that, though
they longed for food, they had lost their natural appetite; whereäs your own people, after a short privation, were
to have a rare relish for their portion.

Wis 16:4 Inevitable that relentless want should seize on the former oppressors; enough for your people to be
shown how their enemies were being tortured.

Wis 16:5 Even when the fearful rage of wild animals overtook them and they were perishing from the bites of
writhing snakes, your retribution did not continue to the end.

Wis 16:6 Affliction struck them briefly, by way of warning, and they had a saving token to remind them of the
commandment of your Law,

Wis 16:7 for whoëver turned to it was saved, not by what he looked at, but by you, the Saviour of all.

Wis 16:8 And by such means you proved to our enemies that you are the one who delivers from every evil;

Wis 16:9 for them, the bites of locusts and flies proved fatal and no remedy could be found to save their lives,
since they deserved to be punished by such creatures.

Wis 16:10 But your children, not even the fangs of poisonous snakes could bring them down; for your mercy
came to their help and cured them.

Wis 16:11 One sting - how quickly healed!-to remind them of your pronouncements rather than that, by sinking
into deep forgetfulness, they should be cut off from your kindness.

Wis 16:12 No herb, no poultice cured them, but your all-healing word, Lord.

Wis 16:13 Yes, you are the one with power over life and death, bringing to the gates of Hades and back again.
Wis 16:14 A human being out of malice may put to death, but cannot bring the departed spirit back or free the
soul that Hades has once received.

Wis 16:15 It is not possible to escape your hand.

Wis 16:16 The godless who refused to acknowledge you were scourged by the strength of your arm, pursued by
no ordinary rains, hail and unrelenting downpours, and consumed by fire.

Wis 16:17 Even more wonderful, in the water — which quenches all — the fire raged fiercer than ever; for the
elements fight for the upright.

Wis 16:18 At one moment, the fire would die down, to avoid consuming the animals sent against the godless
and to make clear to them by that sight, that the sentence of God was pursuing them;

Wis 16:19 at another, in the very heart of the water, it would burn more fiercely than fire to ruin the produce of a
wicked land.

Wis 16:20 How differently with your people! You gave them the food of angels, from heaven untiringly providing
them bread already prepared, containing every delight, to satisfy every taste.

Wis 16:21 And the substance you gave showed your sweetness towards your children, for, conforming to the
taste of whoëver ate it, it transformed itself into what each eater wished.

Wis 16:22 Snow and ice endured the fire, without melting; this was to show them that, to destroy the harvests of
their enemies, fire would burn even in hail and flare in falling rain,

Wis 16:23 whereäs, on the other hand, it would even forget its own strength in the service of feeding the upright.
Wis 16:24 For the creation, being at the service of you, its Creator, tautens to punish the wicked and slackens
for the benefit of those who trust in you.



Wis 16:25 And this is why, by changing into all things, it obediently served your all-nourishing bounty,
conforming to the wishes of those who were in need;

Wis 16:26 so that your beloved children, Lord, might learn that the various crops are not what provide
nourishment, but your word which preserves all who believe in you.

Wis 16:27 For that which fire could not destroy melted in the heat of a single fleeting sunbeam,

Wis 16:28 to show that, to give you thanks, we must rise before the sun and meet you at the dawning of the
day;

Wis 16:29 whereäs the hope of the ungrateful melts like winter frost and flows away like water running to waste.
Wis 17:1 Yes, your judgements are great and impenetrable, which is why uninstructed souls have gone astray.
Wis 17:2 While the wicked supposed they had a holy nation in their power, they themselves lay prisoners of the
dark, in the fetters of long night, confined under their own roofs, banished from eternal providence.

Wis 17:3 While they thought to remain unnoticed with their secret sins, curtained by dark forgetfulness, they
were scattered in fearful dismay, terrified by apparitions.

Wis 17:4 The hiding place sheltering them could not ward off their fear; terrifying noises echoed round them;
and gloomy, grim-faced spectres haunted them.

Wis 17:5 No fire had power enough to give them light, nor could the brightly blazing stars illuminate that dreadful
night.

Wis 17:6 The only light for them was a great, spontaneous blaze — a fearful sight to see! And in their terror,
once that sight had vanished, they thought what they had seen more terrible than ever.

Wis 17:7 Their magical illusions were powerless now, and their claims to intelligence were ignominiously
confounded;

Wis 17:8 for those who promised to drive out fears and disorders from sick souls were now themselves sick with
ludicrous fright.

Wis 17:9 Even when there was nothing frightful to scare them, the vermin creeping past and the hissing of
reptiles filled them with panic;

Wis 17:10 they died convulsed with fright, refusing even to look at empty air, which cannot be eluded anyhow!
Wis 17:11 Wickedness is confessedly very cowardly, and it condemns itself; under pressure from conscience it
always assumes the worst.

Wis 17:12 Fear, indeed, is nothing other than the failure of the help offered by reason;

Wis 17:13 the less you rely within yourself on this, the more alarming it is not to know the cause of your
suffering.

Wis 17:14 And they, all locked in the same sleep, while that darkness lasted — which was in fact quite powerless
and had issued from the depths of equally powerless Hades-

Wis 17:15 were now chased by monstrous spectres, now paralysed by the fainting of their souls; for a sudden,
unexpected terror had attacked them.

Wis 17:16 And thus, whoëver it might be that fell there stayed clamped to the spot in this prison without bars.
Wis 17:17 Whether he was ploughman or shepherd, or somebody at work in the desert, he was still overtaken
and suffered the inevitable fate, for all had been bound by the one same chain of darkness.

Wis 17:18 The soughing of the wind, the tuneful noise of birds in the spreading branches, the measured beat of
water in its powerful course, the headlong din of rocks cascading down,

Wis 17:19 the unseen course of bounding animals, the roaring of the most savage of wild beasts, the echo
rebounding from the clefts in the mountains, all held them paralysed with fear.

Wis 17:20 For the whole world shone with the light of day and, unhindered, went about its work;

Wis 17:21 over them alone there spread a heavy darkness, image of the dark that would receive them. But
heavier than the darkness was the burden they were to themselves.

Wis 18:1 For your holy ones, however, there was a very great light. The Egyptians, who could hear them but not
see them, called them fortunate because they had not suffered too;

Wis 18:2 they thanked them for doing no injury in return for previous wrongs and asked forgiveness for their
past ill-will.

Wis 18:3 In contrast to the darkness, you gave your people a pillar of blazing fire to guide them on their
unknown journey, a mild sun for their ambitious migration.

Wis 18:4 But well those others deserved to be deprived of light and imprisoned in darkness, for they had kept in
captivity your children, by whom the incorruptible light of the Law was to be given to the world.

Wis 18:5 As they had resolved to kill the infants of the holy ones, and as of those exposed only one child had
been saved, you punished them by carrying off their horde of children and by destroying them all in the wild
water.

Wis 18:6 That night had been known in advance to our ancestors, so that, well knowing him in whom they had
put their trust, they would be sure of his promises.

Wis 18:7 Your people thus were waiting both for the rescue of the upright and for the ruin of the enemy;



Wis 18:8 for by the very vengeance that you exacted on our adversaries, you glorified us by calling us to you.
Wis 18:9 So the holy children of the good offered sacrifice in secret and with one accord enacted this holy law:
that the holy ones should share good things and dangers alike; and forthwith they chanted the hymns of the
ancestors.

Wis 18:10 In echo came the discordant cries of their enemies, and the pitiful wails of people mourning for their
children could be heard from far away.

Wis 18:11 One and the same punishment had struck slave and master alike, and now commoner and king had
the same sufferings to endure.

Wis 18:12 Struck by the same death, all had innumerable dead. There were not enough living left to bury them,
for, at one stroke, the flower of their offspring had perished.

Wis 18:13 Those whose spells had made them completely incredulous, when faced with the destruction of their
first-born, acknowledged this people to be child of God.

Wis 18:14 When peaceful silence lay over all, and night had run the half of her swift course,

Wis 18:15 down from the heavens, from the royal throne, leapt your all-powerful Word like a pitiless warrior into
the heart of a land doomed to destruction. Carrying your unambiguous command like a sharp sword,

Wis 18:16 it stood, and filled the universe with death; though standing on the earth, it touched the sky.

Wis 18:17 Immediately, dreams and gruesome visions overwhelmed them with terror, unexpected fears
assailed them.

Wis 18:18 Hurled down, some here, some there, half dead, they were able to say why they were dying;

Wis 18:19 for the dreams that had troubled them had warned them why beforehand, so that they should not
perish without knowing why they were being afflicted.

Wis 18:20 Experience of death, however, touched the upright too, and a great many were struck down in the
desert. But the Retribution did not last long,

Wis 18:21 for a blameless man hurried to their defence. Wielding the weapons of his sacred office, prayer and
expiating incense, he confronted Retribution and put an end to the plague, thus showing that he was your
servant.

Wis 18:22 He overcame Hostility, not by physical strength, nor by force of arms; but by word he prevailed over
the Punisher, by recalling the oaths made to the Fathers, and the covenants.

Wis 18:23 Already the corpses lay piled in heaps, when he interposed and beat Retribution back and cut off its
approach to the living.

Wis 18:24 For the whole world was on his flowing robe, the glorious names of the Fathers engraved on the four
rows of stones, and your Majesty on the diadem on his head.

Wis 18:25 From these the Destroyer recoiled, he was afraid of these. This one experience of Retribution was
enough.

Wis 19:1 But the godless were assailed by merciless anger to the very end, for he knew beforehand what they
would do,

Wis 19:2 how, after letting his people leave and hastening their departure, they would change their minds and
give chase.

Wis 19:3 They were actually still conducting their mourning rites and lamenting at the tombs of their dead, when
another mad scheme came into their heads and they set out to pursue, as though runaways, the people whom
they had expelled and begged to go.

Wis 19:4 A well-deserved fate urged them to this extreme and made them forget what had already happened,
so that they would add to their torments the one punishment outstanding

Wis 19:5 and, while your people were experiencing a journey contrary to all expectations, would themselves
meet an extraordinary death.

Wis 19:6 For the whole creation, submissive to your commands, had its very nature re-created, so that your
children should be preserved from harm.

Wis 19:7 Overshadowing the camp there was the cloud; where there had been water, dry land was seen to rise;
the Red Sea became an unimpeded way, the tempestuous waves, a green plain;

Wis 19:8 sheltered by your hand, the whole nation passed across, gazing at these amazing prodigies.

Wis 19:9 They were like horses at pasture, they skipped like lambs, singing your praises, Lord, their deliverer.
Wis 19:10 For they still remembered the events of their exile, how the land had bred mosquitoes instead of
animals and the River had disgorged millions of frogs instead offish.

Wis 19:11 Later they were to see a new way for birds to come into being, when, goaded by greed, they
demanded something tasty,

Wis 19:12 and quails came up out of the sea to satisfy them.

Wis 19:13 On the sinners, however, punishments rained down not without violent thunder as early warning; and
they suffered what their own crimes had justly deserved since they had shown such bitter hatred to foreigners.
Wis 19:14 Others, indeed, had failed to welcome strangers who came to them, but the Egyptians had enslaved



their own guests and benefactors.

Wis 19:15 The sinners, moreover, will certainly be punished for it, since they gave the foreigners a hostile
welcome;

Wis 19:16 but the latter, having given a festive reception to people who already shared the same rights as
themselves, later overwhelmed them with terrible labours.

Wis 19:17 Hence they were struck with blindness, like the sinners at the gate of the upright, when, yawning
darkness all around them, each had to grope his way through his own door.

Wis 19:18 A new attuning of the elements occurred, as on a harp the notes may change their rhythm, though all
the while preserving the same tone; and this is just what happened:

Wis 19:19 land animals became aquatic, swimming ones took to the land,

Wis 19:20 fire reïnforced its strength in water, and water forgot the power of extinguishing it;

Wis 19:21 flames, on the other hand, did not char the flesh of delicate animals that ventured into them; nor did
they melt the heavenly food resembling ice and as easily melted.

Wis 19:22 Yes, Lord, in every way you have made your people great and glorious; you have never failed to help
them at any time or place.
