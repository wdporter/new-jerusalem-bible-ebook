<h4>On seeking God and rejecting evil (1:1–15)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Love uprightness you who are rulers on earth,</span>
	<span>be properly disposed towards the Lord</span>
	<span>and seek him in simplicity of heart;</span>
	<span>for he will be found by those who do not put him to the test,</span>
	<span>revealing himself to those who do not mistrust him.</span>
	<span>Perverse thoughts, however, separate people from God,</span>
	<span>and power, when put to the test, confounds the stupid.</span>
	<span>Wisdom will never enter the soul of a wrong-doer,</span>
	<span>nor dwell in a body enslaved to sin;</span>
	<span>for the holy spirit of instruction flees deceitfulness,</span>
	<span>recoils from unintelligent thoughts,</span>
	<span>is thwarted by the onset of vice. </span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Wisdom is a spirit friendly to humanity,</span>
	<span>though she will not let a blasphemer’s words go unpunished;</span>
	<span>since God observes the very soul</span>
	<span>and accurately surveys the heart,</span>
	<span>listening to every word.</span>
	<span>For the spirit of the Lord fills the world,</span>
	<span>and that which holds everything together knows every word said.</span>
	<span>No one who speaks what is wrong will go undetected,</span>
	<span>nor will avenging Justice pass by such a one.</span>
	<span>For the schemes of the godless will be examined,</span>
	<span>and a report of his words will reach the Lord</span>
	<span>to convict him of his crimes.</span>
	<span>There is a jealous ear that overhears everything,</span>
	<span>not even a murmur of complaint escapes it.</span>
	<span>So beware of uttering frivolous complaints,</span>
	<span>restrain your tongue from finding fault;</span>
	<span>even what is said in secret has repercussions,</span>
	<span>and a lying mouth deals death to the soul. </span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not court death by the errors of your ways,</span>
	<span>nor invite destruction through the work of your hands.</span>
	<span>For God did not make Death,</span>
	<span>he takes no pleasure in destroying the living.</span>
	<span>To exist — for this he created all things;</span>
	<span>the creatures of the world have health in them,</span>
	<span>in them is no fatal poison,</span>
	<span>and Hades has no power over the world:</span>
	<span>for uprightness is immortal. </span>
</p>

<h4>Life as the godless see it (1:16–2:20)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>But the godless call for Death with deed and word,</span>
	<span>counting him friend, they wear themselves out for him;</span>
	<span>with him they make a pact,</span>
	<span>worthy as they are to belong to him. </span>
</p>

<p class="poem" id="ch2">
	<span>And this is the false argument they use,</span>
	<span>“Our life is short and dreary,</span>
	<span>there is no remedy when our end comes,</span>
	<span>no one is known to have come back from Hades.</span>
	<span>We came into being by chance</span>
	<span>and afterwards shall be as though we had never been.</span>
	<span>The breath in our nostrils is a puff of smoke,</span>
	<span>reason a spark from the beating of our hearts;</span>
	<span>extinguish this and the body turns to ashes,</span>
	<span>and the spirit melts away like the yielding air.</span>
	<span>In time, our name will be forgotten,</span>
	<span>nobody will remember what we have done;</span>
	<span>our life will pass away like wisps of cloud,</span>
	<span>dissolving like the mist</span>
	<span>that the sun’s rays drive away</span>
	<span>and that its heat dispels.</span>
	<span>For our days are the passing of a shadow,</span>
	<span>our end is without return,</span>
	<span>the seal is affixed and nobody comes back. </span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>“Come then, let us enjoy the good things of today,</span>
	<span>let us use created things with the zest of youth:</span>
	<span>take our fill of the dearest wines and perfumes,</span>
	<span>on no account forgo the flowers of spring</span>
	<span>but crown ourselves with rosebuds before they wither,</span>
	<span>no meadow excluded from our orgy;</span>
	<span>let us leave the signs of our revelry everywhere,</span>
	<span>since this is our portion, this our lot! </span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>“As for the upright man who is poor, let us oppress him;</span>
	<span>let us not spare the widow,</span>
	<span>nor respect old age, white-haired with many years.</span>
	<span>Let our might be the yardstick of right,</span>
	<span>since weakness argues its own futility.</span>
	<span>Let us lay traps for the upright man, since he annoys us</span>
	<span>and opposes our way of life,</span>
	<span>reproaches us for our sins against the Law,</span>
	<span>and accuses us of sins against our upbringing.</span>
	<span>He claims to have knowledge of God,</span>
	<span>and calls himself a child of the Lord.</span>
	<span>We see him as a reproof to our way of thinking,</span>
	<span>the very sight of him weighs our spirits down;</span>
	<span>for his kind of life is not like other people’s,</span>
	<span>and his ways are quite different.</span>
	<span>In his opinion we are counterfeit;</span>
	<span>he avoids our ways as he would filth;</span>
	<span>he proclaims the final end of the upright as blessed</span>
	<span>and boasts of having God for his father.</span>
	<span>Let us see if what he says is true,</span>
	<span>and test him to see what sort of end he will have.</span>
	<span>For if the upright man is God’s son, God will help him</span>
	<span>and rescue him from the clutches of his enemies.</span>
	<span>Let us test him with cruelty and with torture,</span>
	<span>and thus explore this gentleness of his</span>
	<span>and put his patience to the test.</span>
	<span>Let us condemn him to a shameful death</span>
	<span>since God will rescue him — or so he claims”. </span>
</p>

<h4>Error of the godless (2:21–24)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>This is the way they reason, but they are misled,</span>
	<span>since their malice makes them blind.</span>
	<span>They do not know the hidden things of God,</span>
	<span>they do not hope for the reward of holiness,</span>
	<span>they do not believe in a reward for blameless souls.</span>
	<span>For God created human beings to be immortal,</span>
	<span>he made them as an image of his own nature;</span>
	<span>Death came into the world only through the Devil’s envy,</span>
	<span>as those who belong to him find to their cost. </span>
</p>

<h4 id="ch3">Destinies of the good and bad compared (3:1–12)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>But the souls of the upright are in the hands of God,</span>
	<span>and no torment can touch them.</span>
	<span>To the unenlightened, they appeared to die,</span>
	<span>their departure was regarded as disaster,</span>
	<span>their leaving us like annihilation;</span>
	<span>but they are at peace.</span>
	<span>If, as it seemed to us, they suffered punishment,</span>
	<span>their hope was rich with immortality;</span>
	<span>slight was their correction, great will their blessings be.</span>
	<span>God was putting them to the test</span>
	<span>and has proved them worthy to be with him;</span>
	<span>he has tested them like gold in a furnace,</span>
	<span>and accepted them as a perfect burnt offering.</span>
	<span>At their time of visitation, they will shine out;</span>
	<span>as sparks run through the stubble, so will they.</span>
	<span>They will judge nations, rule over peoples,</span>
	<span>and the Lord will be their king for ever.</span>
	<span>Those who trust in him will understand the truth,</span>
	<span>those who are faithful will live with him in love;</span>
	<span>for grace and mercy await his holy ones,</span>
	<span>and he intervenes on behalf of his chosen. </span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>But the godless will be duly punished for their reasoning,</span>
	<span>for having neglected the upright and deserted the Lord.</span>
	<span>Yes, wretched are they who scorn wisdom and discipline:</span>
	<span>their hope is void,</span>
	<span>their toil unavailing,</span>
	<span>their achievements unprofitable;</span>
	<span>their wives are reckless,</span>
	<span>their children depraved,</span>
	<span>their descendants accursed. </span>
</p>

<h4>Better be sterile than have godless children (3:13–4:6)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Blessed the sterile woman if she be blameless,</span>
	<span>and has not known an unlawful bed,</span>
	<span>for she will have fruit at the visitation of souls.</span>
	<span>Blessed, too, the eunuch whose hand commits no crime,</span>
	<span>and who harbours no resentment against the Lord:</span>
	<span>a special favour will be granted to him for his loyalty,</span>
	<span>a most desirable portion in the temple of the Lord.</span>
	<span>For the fruit of honest labours is glorious,</span>
	<span>and the root of understanding does not decay.</span>
	<span>But the children of adulterers will not reach maturity,</span>
	<span>the offspring of an unlawful bed will disappear.</span>
	<span>Even if they live long, they will count for nothing,</span>
	<span>their old age will go unhonoured at the last;</span>
	<span>while if they die early, they have neither hope</span>
	<span>nor comfort on the day of judgement,</span>
	<span>for the end of a race of evil-doers is harsh.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem" id="ch4">
	<span>Better to have no children yet to have virtue,</span>
	<span>since immortality perpetuates its memory;</span>
	<span>for God and human beings both recognise it.</span>
	<span>Present, we imitate it,</span>
	<span>absent, we long for it;</span>
	<span>crowned, it holds triumph through eternity,</span>
	<span>having striven for untainted prizes and emerged the victor. </span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>But the offspring of the godless come to nothing, however prolific,</span>
	<span>sprung from a bastard stock, they will never strike deep roots,</span>
	<span>never put down firm foundations.</span>
	<span>They may branch out for a time,</span>
	<span>but, on unsteady foundations, they will be rocked by the wind</span>
	<span>and uprooted by the force of the storm;</span>
	<span>their branches, yet unformed, will be snapped off,</span>
	<span>their fruit be useless,</span>
	<span>too unripe to eat,</span>
	<span>fit for nothing.</span>
	<span>For children begotten of unlawful bed</span>
	<span>witness, when put on trial, to their parents’ wickedness. </span>
</p>

<h4>The premature death of the upright (4:7–19)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The upright, though he die before his time, will find rest.</span>
	<span>Length of days is not what makes age honourable,</span>
	<span>nor number of years the true measure of life;</span>
	<span>understanding, this is grey hairs,</span>
	<span>untarnished life, this is ripe old age.</span>
	<span>Having won God’s favour, he has been loved</span>
	<span>and, as he was living among sinners, has been taken away.</span>
	<span>He has been carried off so that evil may not warp</span>
	<span>his understanding or deceitfulness seduce his soul;</span>
	<span>for the fascination of evil throws good things into the shade,</span>
	<span>and the whirlwind of desire corrupts a simple heart.</span>
	<span>Having come to perfection so soon, he has lived long;</span>
	<span>his soul being pleasing to the Lord,</span>
	<span>he has hurried away from the wickedness around him. </span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Yet people look on, uncomprehending;</span>
	<span>and it does not enter their heads</span>
	<span>that grace and mercy await his chosen ones</span>
	<span>and that he intervenes on behalf of his holy ones.</span>
	<span>The upright who dies condemns the godless who survive,</span>
	<span>and youth quickly perfected condemns the lengthy old age of the wicked.</span>
	<span>These people see the end of the wise</span>
	<span>without understanding what the Lord has in store</span>
	<span>or why he has taken such a one to safety;</span>
	<span>they look on and sneer,</span>
	<span>but the Lord will laugh at them.</span>
	<span>Soon they will be corpses without honour,</span>
	<span>objects of horror among the dead for ever.</span>
	<span>For he will shatter them and fling them headlong and dumbfounded.</span>
	<span>He will shake them from their foundations;</span>
	<span>they will be utterly laid waste,</span>
	<span>a prey to grief,</span>
	<span>and their memory will perish. </span>
</p>

<h4>The godless called to judgement (4:20–5:14)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>When the count of their sins has been drawn up, in terror they will come,</span>
	<span>and their crimes, confronting them, will accuse them. </span>
	<span id="ch5">Then the upright will stand up boldly</span>
	<span>to face those who had oppressed him</span>
	<span>and had thought so little of his sufferings.</span>
	<span>And, seeing him, they will be seized with terrible fear,</span>
	<span>amazed that he should have been so unexpectedly saved.</span>
	<span>Stricken with remorse, they will say to one another</span>
	<span>with groans and labouring breath,</span>
	<span>“This is the one whom we used to mock,</span>
	<span>making him the butt of our insults, fools that we were!</span>
	<span>His life we regarded as madness,</span>
	<span>his ending as without honour.</span>
	<span>How has he come to be counted as one of the children of God</span>
	<span>and to have his lot among the holy ones?</span>
	<span>Clearly we have strayed from the way of truth;</span>
	<span>the light of justice has not shone for us,</span>
	<span>the sun has not risen for us.</span>
	<span>We have left no path of lawlessness or ruin unexplored,</span>
	<span>we have crossed deserts where there was no track,</span>
	<span>but the way of the Lord is one we have never known.</span>
	<span>What good has arrogance been to us?</span>
	<span>What has been the purpose of our riches and boastfulness?</span>
	<span>All those things have passed like a shadow,</span>
	<span>passed like a fleeting rumour.</span>
	<span>Like a ship that cuts through heaving waves —</span>
	<span>leaving no trace to show where it has passed,</span>
	<span>no wake from its keel in the waves.</span>
	<span>Or like a bird flying through the air —</span>
	<span>leaving no proof of its passing;</span>
	<span>it whips the light air with the stroke of its pinions,</span>
	<span>tears it apart in its whirring rush,</span>
	<span>drives its way onward with sweeping wing,</span>
	<span>and afterwards no sign is seen of its passage.</span>
	<span>Or like an arrow shot at a mark,</span>
	<span>the pierced air closing so quickly on itself,</span>
	<span>there is no knowing which way the arrow has passed.</span>
	<span>So with us: scarcely born, we disappear;</span>
	<span>of virtue not a trace have we to show,</span>
	<span>we have spent ourselves in our own wickedness!”.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>For the hope of the godless is like chaff carried on the wind,</span>
	<span>like fine spray driven by the storm;</span>
	<span>it disperses like smoke before the wind,</span>
	<span>goes away like the memory of a one-day guest.</span>
</p>

<h4>Glorious destiny of the upright and punishment of the godless (5:15–23)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>But the upright live for ever,</span>
	<span>their recompense is with the Lord,</span>
	<span>and the Most High takes care of them.</span>
	<span>So they will receive the glorious crown</span>
	<span>and the diadem of beauty from the Lord’s hand;</span>
	<span>for he will shelter them with his right hand</span>
	<span>and with his arm he will shield them. </span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>For armour he will take his jealous love,</span>
	<span>he will arm creation to punish his enemies;</span>
	<span>he will put on justice as a breastplate,</span>
	<span>and for helmet wear his forthright judgement;</span>
	<span>he will take up invincible holiness for shield,</span>
	<span>of his pitiless wrath he will forge a sword,</span>
	<span>and the universe will march with him to fight the reckless.</span>
	<span>Bolts truly aimed, the shafts of lightning will leap,</span>
	<span>and from the clouds, as from a full-drawn bow, fly to their mark;</span>
	<span>and the catapult will hurl hailstones charged with fury.</span>
	<span>The waters of the sea will rage against them,</span>
	<span>the rivers engulf them without pity,</span>
	<span>a mighty gale will rise against them</span>
	<span>and winnow them like a hurricane.</span>
	<span>Thus wickedness will lay the whole earth waste</span>
	<span>and evil-doing bring down the thrones of the mighty.</span>
</p>

<h2 id="ii">II: Solomon and the Quest for Wisdom (6:1–9:18)</h2>

<h4>King should seek Wisdom (6:1–11)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Listen then, kings, and understand; </span>
	<span>rulers of remotest lands, take warning;</span>
	<span>hear this, you who govern great populations,</span>
	<span>taking pride in your hosts of subject nations!</span>
	<span>For sovereignty is given to you by the Lord</span>
	<span>and power by the Most High,</span>
	<span>who will himself probe your acts and scrutinise your intentions.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>If therefore, as servants of his kingdom, you have not ruled justly</span>
	<span>nor observed the law,</span>
	<span>nor followed the will of God,</span>
	<span>he will fall on you swiftly and terribly.</span>
	<span>On the highly placed a ruthless judgement falls;</span>
	<span>the lowly are pardoned, out of pity,</span>
	<span>but the mighty will be mightily tormented.</span>
	<span>For the Lord of all does not cower before anyone,</span>
	<span>he does not stand in awe of greatness,</span>
	<span>since he himself has made small and great</span>
	<span>and provides for all alike;</span>
	<span>but a searching trial awaits those who wield power.</span>
	<span>So, monarchs, my words are meant for you,</span>
	<span>so that you may learn wisdom and not fall into error;</span>
	<span>for those who in holiness observe holy things will be adjudged holy,</span>
	<span>and, accepting instruction from them, will find their defence in them.</span>
	<span>Set your heart, therefore, on what I have to say,</span>
	<span>listen with a will, and you will be instructed.</span>
</p>

<h4>Wisdom sought is Wisdom found (6:12–21)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Wisdom is brilliant, she never fades.</span>
	<span>By those who love her, she is readily seen,</span>
	<span>by those who seek her, she is readily found.</span>
	<span>She anticipates those who desire her by making herself known first.</span>
	<span>Whoëver gets up early to seek her will have no trouble</span>
	<span>but will find her sitting at the door.</span>
	<span>Meditating on her is understanding in its perfect form,</span>
	<span>and anyone keeping awake for her will soon be free from care.</span>
	<span>For she herself searches everywhere for those who are worthy of her,</span>
	<span>benevolently appearing to them on their ways,</span>
	<span>anticipating their every thought.</span>
	<span>For Wisdom begins with the sincere desire for instruction,</span>
	<span>care for instruction means loving her,</span>
	<span>loving her means keeping her laws,</span>
	<span>attention to her laws guarantees incorruptibility,</span>
	<span>and incorruptibility brings us near to God;</span>
	<span>the desire for Wisdom thus leads to sovereignty.</span>
	<span>If then thrones and sceptres delight you, monarchs of the nations,</span>
	<span>honour Wisdom, so that you may reign for ever.</span>
</p>

<h4>Solomon proposes to describe Wisdom (6:22–25)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>What Wisdom is and how she was born, I shall now explain;</span>
	<span>I shall hide no mysteries from you,</span>
	<span>but shall follow her steps from the outset of her origin,</span>
	<span>setting out what we know of her in full light,</span>
	<span>without departing from the truth.</span>
	<span>Blighting envy is no companion for me,</span>
	<span>for envy has nothing in common with Wisdom.</span>
	<span>In the greatest number of the wise lies the world’s salvation,</span>
	<span>in a sagacious king the stability of a people.</span>
	<span>Learn, therefore, from my words; the gain will be yours.</span>
</p>

<h4 id="ch7">Solomon a man like other men (7:1–6)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>I too am mortal like everyone else,</span>
	<span>a descendant of the first man formed from the earth.</span>
	<span>I was modelled in flesh inside a mother’s womb,</span>
	<span>where, for ten months, in blood I acquired substance —</span>
	<span>the result of virile seed and pleasure, sleep’s companion.</span>
	<span>I too, when I was born, drew in the common air,</span>
	<span>I fell on the same ground that bears us all,</span>
	<span>and crying was the first sound I made, like everyone else.</span>
	<span>I was nurtured in swaddling clothes, with every care.</span>
	<span>No king has known any other beginning of existence;</span>
	<span>for there is only one way into life, and one way out of it.</span>
</p>

<h4>Solomon’s respect for Wisdom (7:7–14)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>And so I prayed, and understanding was given me;</span>
	<span>I entreated, and the spirit of Wisdom came to me.</span>
	<span>I esteemed her more than sceptres and thrones;</span>
	<span>compared with her, I held riches as nothing.</span>
	<span>I reckoned no precious stone to be her equal,</span>
	<span>for compared with her, all gold is a pinch of sand,</span>
	<span>and beside her, silver ranks as mud.</span>
	<span>I loved her more than health or beauty,</span>
	<span>preferred her to the light,</span>
	<span>since her radiance never sleeps.</span>
	<span>In her company all good things came to me,</span>
	<span>and at her hands incalculable wealth.</span>
	<span>All these delighted me, since Wisdom brings them,</span>
	<span>though I did not then realise that she was their mother.</span>
	<span>What I learned diligently, I shall pass on liberally,</span>
	<span>I shall not conceal how rich she is.</span>
	<span>For she is to human beings an inexhaustible treasure,</span>
	<span>and those who acquire this win God’s friendship,</span>
	<span>commended to him by the gifts of instruction.</span>
</p>

<h4>His appeal for divine instruction (7:15–21)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>May God grant me to speak as he would wish</span>
	<span>and conceive thoughts worthy of the gifts I have received,</span>
	<span>since he is both guide to Wisdom and director of sages;</span>
	<span>for we are in his hand, yes, ourselves and our sayings,</span>
	<span>and all intellectual and all practical knowledge.</span>
	<span>He it was who gave me sure knowledge of what exists,</span>
	<span>to understand the structure of the world and the action of the elements,</span>
	<span>the beginning, end and middle of the times,</span>
	<span>the alternation of the solstices and the succession of the seasons,</span>
	<span>the cycles of the year and the position of the stars,</span>
	<span>the natures of animals and the instincts of wild beasts,</span>
	<span>the powers of spirits and human mental processes,</span>
	<span>the varieties of plants and the medical properties of roots.</span>
	<span>And now I understand everything, hidden or visible,</span>
	<span>for Wisdom, the designer of all things, has instructed me.</span>

<h4>Eulogy of Wisdom (7:22–8:1)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>For within her is a spirit intelligent, holy,</span>
	<span>unique, manifold, subtle,</span>
	<span>mobile, incisive, unsullied,</span>
	<span>lucid, invulnerable, benevolent, shrewd,</span>
	<span>irresistible, beneficent, friendly to human beings,</span>
	<span>steadfast, dependable, unperturbed,</span>
	<span>almighty, all-surveying,</span>
	<span>penetrating all intelligent, pure</span>
	<span>and most subtle spirits.</span>
	<span>For Wisdom is quicker to move than any motion;</span>
	<span>she is so pure, she pervades and permeates all things.</span>
	<span>She is a breath of the power of God,</span>
	<span>pure emanation of the glory of the Almighty;</span>
	<span>so nothing impure can find its way into her.</span>
	<span>For she is a reflection of the eternal light,</span>
	<span>untarnished mirror of God’s active power,</span>
	<span>and image of his goodness.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Although she is alone, she can do everything;</span>
	<span>herself unchanging, she renews the world,</span>
	<span>and, generation after generation, passing into holy souls,</span>
	<span>she makes them into God’s friends and prophets;</span>
	<span>for God loves only those who dwell with Wisdom.</span>
	<span>She is indeed more splendid than the sun,</span>
	<span>she outshines all the constellations;</span>
	<span>compared with light, she takes first place,</span>
	<span>for light must yield to night,</span>
	<span>but against Wisdom evil cannot prevail.</span>
	<span id="ch8">Strongly she reaches from one end of the world to the other</span>
	<span>and she governs the whole world for its good.</span>

<h4>Solomon’s love for Wisdom (8:2–8)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>
		Wisdom I loved and searched for from my youth;</span>
	<span>I resolved to have her as my bride,</span>
	<span>I fell in love with her beauty.</span>
	<span>She enhances her noble birth by sharing God’s life,</span>
	<span>for the Master of All has always loved her.</span>
	<span>Indeed, she shares the secrets of God’s knowledge,</span>
	<span>and she chooses what he will do.</span>
	<span>If in this life wealth is a desirable possession,</span>
	<span>what is more wealthy than Wisdom whose work is everywhere?</span>
	<span>Or if it be the intellect that is at work,</span>
	<span>who, more than she, designs whatever exists?</span>
	<span>Or if it be uprightness you love,</span>
	<span>why, virtues are the fruit of her labours,</span>
	<span>since it is she who teaches temperance and prudence,</span>
	<span>justice and fortitude;</span>
	<span>nothing in life is more useful for human beings.</span>
	<span>Or if you are eager for wide experience,</span>
	<span>she knows the past, she forecasts the future;</span>
	<span>she knows how to turn maxims, and solve riddles;</span>
	<span>she has foreknowledge of signs and wonders,</span>
	<span>and of the unfolding of the ages and the times.</span>
</p>

<h4>Wisdom indispensable to rulers (8:9–16)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>I therefore determined to take her to share my life,</span>
	<span>knowing that she would be my counsellor in prosperity</span>
	<span>and comfort me in cares and sorrow.</span>
	<span>“Thanks to her, I shall be admired by the masses</span>
	<span>and honoured, though young, by the elders.</span>
	<span>I shall be reckoned shrewd as a judge,</span>
	<span>and the great will be amazed at me.</span>
	<span>They will wait on my silences,</span>
	<span>and pay attention when I speak;</span>
	<span>if I speak at some length, they will lay their hand on their lips.</span>
	<span>By means of her, immortality will be mine,</span>
	<span>I shall leave an everlasting memory to my successors.</span>
	<span>I shall govern peoples, and nations will be subject to me;</span>
	<span>at the sound of my name fearsome despots will be afraid;</span>
	<span>I shall show myself kind to the people and valiant in battle.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>“When I go home I shall take my ease with her,</span>
	<span>for nothing is bitter in her company,</span>
	<span>when life is shared with her there is no pain,</span>
	<span>nothing but pleasure and joy”.</span>

<h4>Solomon prepares to ask for Wisdom (8:17–21)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Having meditated on all this,</span>
	<span>and having come to the conclusion</span>
	<span>that immortality resides in kinship with Wisdom,</span>
	<span>noble contentment in her friendship,</span>
	<span>inexhaustible riches in her activities,</span>
	<span>understanding in cultivating her society,</span>
	<span>and renown in conversing with her,</span>
	<span>I went all ways, seeking how to get her.</span>
	<span>I was a boy of happy disposition,</span>
	<span>I had received a good soul as my lot,</span>
	<span>or rather, being good, I had entered an undefiled body;</span>
	<span>but, realising that I could never possess Wisdom unless God gave her to me,</span>
	<span>— a sign of intelligence in itself, to know in whose gift she lay —</span>
	<span>I prayed to the Lord and entreated him,</span>
	<span>and with all my heart I said:</span>
</p>

<h4 id="ch9">Solomon’s prayer for Wisdom (9:1–18)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>“God of our ancestors, Lord of mercy,</span>
	<span>who by your word have made the universe,</span>
	<span>and in your wisdom have fitted human beings</span>
	<span>to rule the creatures that you have made,</span>
	<span>to govern the world in holiness and saving justice</span>
	<span>and in honesty of soul to dispense fair judgement,</span>
	<span>grant me Wisdom, consort of your throne,</span>
	<span>and do not reject me from the number of your children.</span>
	<span>For I am your servant, son of your serving maid,</span>
	<span>a feeble man, with little time to live,</span>
	<span>with small understanding of justice and the laws.</span>
	<span>Indeed, were anyone perfect among the sons of men,</span>
	<span>if he lacked the Wisdom that comes from you, he would still count for nothing.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>“You have chosen me to be king over your people,</span>

	<span>a copy of the holy Tent which you prepared at the beginning.</span>
	<span>With you is Wisdom, she who knows your works,</span>
	<span>she who was present when you made the world;</span>
	<span>she understands what is pleasing in your eyes</span>

	<span>Despatch her from the holy heavens,</span>
	<span>send her forth from your throne of glory</span>
	<span>to help me and to toil with me</span>

	<span>Then all I do will be acceptable,</span>
	<span>I shall govern your people justly</span>

</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>“What human being indeed can know the intentions of God?</span>
	<span>And who can comprehend the will of the Lord?</span>
	<span>For the reasoning of mortals is inadequate,</span>
	<span>our attitudes of mind unstable;</span>
	<span>for a perishable body presses down the soul,</span>
	<span>and this tent of clay weighs down the mind with its many cares.</span>
	<span>It is hard enough for us to work out what is on earth,</span>
	<span>laborious to know what lies within our reach;</span>
	<span>who, then, can discover what is in the heavens?</span>
	<span>And who could ever have known your will, had you not given Wisdom</span>
	<span>and sent your holy Spirit from above?</span>
	<span>Thus have the paths of those on earth been straightened</span>
	<span>and people have been taught what pleases you,</span>

<h2 id="iii">III: Wisdom at Work in History (10:1–19:22)</h2>

<h4>From Adam to Moses (10:1–14)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>It was Wisdom who protected the first man to be fashioned,</span>
	<span>the father of the world, who had been created all alone,</span>
	<span>she it was who rescued him from his fall</span>
	<span>and gave him the strength to subjugate all things.</span>
	<span>But when in his wrath a wicked man deserted her,</span>
	<span>he perished in his fratricidal fury.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>When because of him the earth was drowned, it was Wisdom again who saved it,</span>
	<span>piloting the upright man on valueless timber.</span>
	<span>Again, when, concurring in wickedness, the nations had been thrown into confusion,</span>
	<span>she singled out the upright man, preserved him blameless before God</span>
	<span>and fortified him against pity for his child.</span>
	<span>She it was who, while the godless perished, saved the upright man</span>
	<span>as he fled from the fire raining down on the Five Cities,</span>
	<span>in witness against whose evil ways</span>
	<span>a desolate land still smokes,</span>
	<span>where plants bear fruit that never ripens</span>
	<span>and where, monument to an unbelieving soul, there stands a pillar of salt.</span>
	<span>For, by ignoring the path of Wisdom,</span>
	<span>not only did they suffer the loss of not knowing the good,</span>
	<span>but they left the world a memorial to their folly,</span>
	<span>so that their offences could not pass unnoticed.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>But Wisdom delivered her servants from their ordeals.</span>
	<span>The upright man, fleeing from the anger of his brother,</span>
	<span>was led by her along straight paths.</span>
	<span>She showed him the kingdom of God</span>
	<span>and taught him the knowledge of holy things.</span>
	<span>She brought him success in his labours</span>
	<span>and gave him full return for all his efforts;</span>
	<span>she stood by him against grasping and oppressive men</span>
	<span>and she made him rich.</span>
	<span>She preserved him from his enemies</span>
	<span>and saved him from the traps they set for him.</span>
	<span>In an arduous struggle she awarded him the prize,</span>
	<span>to teach him that piety is stronger than all.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>She did not forsake the upright man when he was sold,</span>
	<span>but snatched him away from sin;</span>
	<span>she accompanied him down into the pit,</span>
	<span>nor did she abandon him in his chains</span>
	<span>until she had brought him the sceptre of a kingdom</span>
	<span>and authority over his despotic masters,</span>
	<span>thus exposing as liars those who had traduced him,</span>
	<span>and giving him honour everlasting.</span>
</p>

<h4>The Exodus (10:15–11:3)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>It was Wisdom who delivered a holy people,</span>
	<span>a blameless race, from a nation of oppressors.</span>
	<span>She entered the soul of a servant of the Lord,</span>
	<span>and withstood fearsome kings with wonders and signs.</span>
	<span>To the holy people she gave the wages of their labours;</span>
	<span>she guided them by a marvellous road,</span>
	<span>herself their shelter by day —</span>
	<span>and their starlight through the night.</span>
	<span>She brought them across the Red Sea,</span>
	<span>leading them through an immensity of water,</span>
	<span>whereäs she drowned their enemies,</span>
	<span>then spat them out from the depths of the abyss.</span>
	<span>So the upright despoiled the godless;</span>
	<span>Lord, they extolled your holy name,</span>
	<span>and with one accord praised your protecting hand;</span>
	<span>for Wisdom opened the mouths of the dumb</span>
	<span>and made eloquent the tongues of babes.</span>
	<span id="ch11">She made their actions successful, by means of a holy prophet.</span>
	<span>They journeyed through an unpeopled desert</span>
	<span>and pitched their tents in inaccessible places.</span>
	<span>They stood firm against their enemies, fought off their foes.</span>
</p>

<h4>First antithesis: miracle of the water (11:4–14)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>On you they called when they were thirsty,</span>
	<span>and from the rocky cliff water was given them,</span>
	<span>from hard stone a remedy for their thirst.</span>
	<span>Thus, what had served to punish their enemies</span>
	<span>became a benefit for them in their difficulties.</span>
	<span>Whereäs their enemies had only the ever-flowing source</span>
	<span>of a river fouled with mingled blood and mud,</span>
	<span>to punish them for their decree of infanticide,</span>
	<span>you gave your people, against all hope, water in abundance,</span>
	<span>once you had shown by the thirst that they were experiencing</span>
	<span>how severely you were punishing their enemies.</span>
	<span>From their own ordeals, which were only loving correction,</span>
	<span>they realised how an angry sentence was tormenting the godless;</span>
	<span>for you had tested your own as a father admonishes,</span>
	<span>but the others you had punished as a pitiless king condemns,</span>
	<span>and, whether far or near, they were equally afflicted.</span>
	<span>For a double sorrow seized on them,</span>
	<span>and a groaning at the memory of the past;</span>
	<span>when they learned that the punishments they were receiving</span>
	<span>were beneficial to the others, they realised it was the Lord,</span>
	<span>while for the man whom long before they had exposed and later mockingly rebuffed,</span>
	<span>they felt only admiration when all was done,</span>
	<span>having suffered a thirst so different from that of the upright.</span>
</p>

<h4>God’s forbearance with Egypt (11:15–20)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>For their foolish and wicked notions which led them astray</span>
	<span>into worshipping mindless reptiles and contemptible beetles,</span>
	<span>you sent a horde of mindless animals to punish them</span>
	<span>and to teach them that the agent of sin is the agent of punishment.</span>
	<span>And indeed your all-powerful hand which created</span>
	<span>the world from formless matter, did not lack means</span>
	<span>to unleash a horde of bears or savage lions on them</span>
	<span>or unknown beasts, newly created, full of rage,</span>
	<span>breathing out fire,</span>
	<span>or puffing out stinking smoke,</span>
	<span>or flashing fearful sparks from their eyes,</span>
	<span>beasts able not only to destroy them, being so savage,</span>
	<span>but even to strike them dead by their terrifying appearance.</span>
	<span>However, without these, one breath could have blown them over,</span>
	<span>pursued by Justice,</span>
	<span>whirled away by the breath of your power.</span>
	<span>You, however, ordered all things by measure, number and weight.</span>
</p>

<h4>This forbearance explained (11:21–12:2)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>For your great power is always at your service,</span>
	<span>and who can withstand the might of your arm?</span>
	<span>The whole world, for you, can no more than tip a balance,</span>
	<span>like a drop of morning dew falling on the ground.</span>
	<span>Yet you are merciful to all, because you are almighty,</span>
	<span>you overlook people’s sins, so that they can repent.</span>
	<span>Yes, you love everything that exists,</span>
	<span>and nothing that you have made disgusts you,</span>
	<span>since, if you had hated something, you would not have made it.</span>
	<span>And how could a thing subsist, had you not willed it?</span>
	<span>Or how be preserved, if not called forth by you?</span>
	<span>No, you spare all, since all is yours, Lord, lover of life!</span>
	<span id="ch12">For your imperishable spirit is in everything!</span>
	<span>And thus, gradually, you correct those who offend;</span>
	<span>you admonish and remind them of how they have sinned,</span>
	<span>so that they may abstain from evil and trust in you, Lord.</span>
</p>

<h4>God’s forbearance with Canaan (12:3–11)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The ancient inhabitants of your holy land</span>
	<span>you hated for their loathsome practices,</span>
	<span>their acts of sorcery, and unholy rites.</span>
	<span>Those ruthless murderers of children,</span>
	<span>those eaters of entrails at feasts of human flesh and of blood,</span>
	<span>those initiates of secret brotherhoods,</span>
	<span>those murderous parents of defenceless beings,</span>
	<span>you determined to destroy at our ancestors’ hands,</span>
	<span>so that this land, dearer to you than any other,</span>
	<span>might receive a worthy colony of God’s children.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Even so, since these were human, you treated them leniently,</span>
	<span>sending hornets as forerunners of your army,</span>
	<span>to exterminate them little by little.</span>
	<span>Not that you were unable to hand the godless over to the upright in pitched battle</span>
	<span>or destroy them at once by savage beasts or one harsh word;</span>
	<span>but, by carrying out your sentences gradually, you gave them a chance to repent,</span>
	<span>although you knew that they were inherently evil,</span>
	<span>innately wicked,</span>
	<span>and fixed in their cast of mind;</span>
	<span>for they were a race accursed from the beginning.</span>
</p>

<h4>This forbearance explained (12:12–18)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Nor was it from awe of anyone that you let their sins go unpunished.</span>
	<span>For who is there to ask, “What have you done?”?</span>
	<span>Or who is there to disagree with your sentence?</span>
	<span>Who to arraign you for destroying nations which you have created?</span>
	<span>Who to confront you by championing the wicked?</span>
	<span>For there is no god, other than you, who cares for every one,</span>
	<span>to whom you have to prove that your sentences have been just.</span>
	<span>No more could any king or despot challenge you over those whom you have punished.</span>
	<span>For, being upright yourself, you rule the universe uprightly,</span>
	<span>and hold it as incompatible with your power</span>
	<span>to condemn anyone who has not deserved to be punished.</span>
	<span>For your strength is the basis of your saving justice,</span>
	<span>and your sovereignty over all makes you lenient to all.</span>
	<span>You show your strength when people will not believe in your absolute power,</span>
	<span>and you confound any insolence in those who do know it.</span>
	<span>But you, controlling your strength, are mild in judgement, and govern us with great lenience,</span>
	<span>for you have only to will, and your power is there.</span>
</p>

<h4>God’s lessons for Israel (12:19–22)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>By acting thus, you have taught your people</span>
	<span>that the upright must be kindly to his fellows,</span>
	<span>and you have given your children the good hope</span>
	<span>that after sins you will grant repentance.</span>
	<span>For, if with such care and indulgence you have punished</span>
	<span>your children’s enemies, though doomed to death,</span>
	<span>and have given them time and place to be rid of their wickedness,</span>
	<span>with what exact attention have you not judged your children,</span>
	<span>to whose ancestors, by oaths and covenants, you made such generous promises?</span>
	<span>Thus, you instruct us, when you punish our enemies in moderation,</span>
	<span>that we should reflect on your kindness when we judge,</span>
	<span>and, when we are judged, we should look for mercy.</span>
</p>

<h4>Progressive punishment of the Egyptians (12:23–27)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>And this is why people leading foolish and wicked lives</span>
	<span>were tortured by you with their own abominations;</span>
	<span>for they had strayed too far on the paths of error</span>
	<span>by taking the vilest and most despicable of animals for gods,</span>
	<span>being deluded like silly little children.</span>
	<span>So, as to children with no sense,</span>
	<span>you gave them a sentence making fools of them.</span>
	<span>Those, however, who would not take warning from a mocking reproof</span>
	<span>were soon to endure a sentence worthy of God.</span>
	<span>The creatures that made them suffer and against which they protested,</span>
	<span>those very creatures that they had taken for gods and by which they were punished they saw in their true
		light;</span>
	<span>and he whom hitherto they had refused to know, they realised was true God.</span>
	<span>And this is why the final condemnation fell on them.</span>
</p>

<h4 id="ch13">Indictment of idolatry: the deification of nature (13:1–9)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Yes, naturally stupid are all who are unaware of God,</span>
	<span>and who, from good things seen, have not been able to discover Him-who-is,</span>
	<span>or, by studying the works, have not recognised the Artificer.</span>
	<span>Fire, however, or wind, or the swift air,</span>
	<span>the sphere of the stars, impetuous water, heaven’s lamps,</span>
	<span>are what they have held to be the gods who govern the world.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>If, charmed by their beauty, they have taken these for gods,</span>
	<span>let them know how much the Master of these excels them,</span>
	<span>since he was the very source of beauty that created them.</span>
	<span>And if they have been impressed by their power and energy,</span>
	<span>let them deduce from these how much mightier is he that has formed them,</span>
	<span>since through the grandeur and beauty of the creatures</span>
	<span>we may, by analogy, contemplate their Author.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Small blame, however, attaches to them,</span>
	<span>for perhaps they go astray</span>
	<span>only in their search for God and their eagerness to find him;</span>
	<span>familiar with his works, they investigate them</span>
	<span>and fall victim to appearances, seeing so much beauty.</span>
	<span>But even so, they have no excuse:</span>
	<span>if they are capable of acquiring enough knowledge</span>
	<span>to be able to investigate the world,</span>
	<span>how have they been so slow to find its Master?</span>
</p>

<h4>The cults of idols (13:10–14:11)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>But wretched are they, with their hopes set on dead things,</span>
	<span>who have given the title of gods to human artefacts,</span>
	<span>gold or silver, skilfully worked,</span>

	<span>or useless stone, carved by some hand long ago.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Take a woodcutter. He fells a suitable tree,</span>
	<span>neatly strips off the bark all over</span>
	<span>and then with admirable skill</span>
	<span>works the wood into an object useful in daily life.</span>
	<span>The bits left over from his work</span>
	<span>he uses for cooking his food, then eats his fill.</span>
	<span>There is still a good-for-nothing bit left over,</span>
	<span>a gnarled and knotted billet:</span>
	<span>he takes it and whittles it with the concentration of his leisure hours,</span>
	<span>he shapes it with the skill of experience,</span>
	<span>he gives it a human shape</span>
	<span>or perhaps he makes it into some vile animal, </span>
	<span>smears it with ochre, paints its surface red,</span>
	<span>coats over all its blemishes.</span>
	<span>He next makes a worthy home for it,</span>
	<span>lets it into the wall, fixes it with an iron clamp.</span>
	<span>Thus he makes sure that it will not fall down —</span>
	<span>being well aware that it cannot help itself,</span>
	<span>since it is only an image, and needs to be helped.</span>
	<span>And yet, if he wishes to pray for his goods, for his marriage, for his children,</span>
	<span>he does not blush to harangue this lifeless thing —</span>
	<span>for health, he invokes what is weak,</span>
	<span>for life, he pleads with what is dead,</span>
	<span>for help, he goes begging to total inexperience,</span>
	<span>for a journey, what cannot even use its feet,</span>
	<span>for profit, an undertaking, and success in pursuing his craft,</span>
	<span>he asks skill from something whose hands have no skill whatever.</span>
	<span id="ch14">Or someöne else, taking ship to cross the wild waves,</span>
	<span>loudly invokes a piece of wood frailer than the vessel that bears him.</span>
	<span>Agreed, the ship is the product of a craving for gain,</span>
	<span>its building embodies the wisdom of the shipwright;</span>
	<span>but your providence, Father, is what steers it,</span>
	<span>you having opened a pathway even through the sea,</span>
	<span>and a safe way over the waves,</span>
	<span>showing that you can save, whatever happens,</span>
	<span>so that, even without experience, someöne may put to sea.</span>
	<span>It is not your will that the works of your Wisdom should be sterile,</span>
	<span>so people entrust their lives to the smallest piece of wood,</span>
	<span>cross the waves on a raft, yet are kept safe and sound.</span>
	<span>Why, in the beginning, when the proud giants were perishing,</span>
	<span>the hope of the world took refuge on a raft</span>
	<span>and, steered by your hand, preserved the seed of a new generation for the ages to come.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>For blessed is the wood which serves the cause of uprightness</span>
	<span>but accursed the man-made idol, yes, it and its maker,</span>
	<span>he for having made it, and it because, though perishable, it has been called god.</span>
	<span>For God holds the godless and his godlessness in equal hatred;</span>
	<span>both work and workman will alike be punished.</span>
	<span>Hence even the idols of the nations will have a visitation</span>
	<span>since, in God’s creation, they have become an abomination,</span>
	<span>a scandal for human souls,</span>
	<span>a snare for the feet of the foolish.</span>
</p>

<h4>Origin of the cult of idols (14:12–21)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The idea of making idols was the origin of fornication,</span>
	<span>their discovery corrupted life.</span>
	<span>They did not exist at the beginning, they will not exist for ever;</span>
	<span>human vanity brought them into the world,</span>
	<span>and a quick end is therefore reserved for them.</span>
	<span>A father afflicted by untimely mourning</span>
	<span>has an image made of his child so soon carried off,</span>
	<span>and now pays divine honours to what yesterday was only a corpse,</span>
	<span>handing on mysteries and ceremonies to his people;</span>
	<span>time passes, the custom hardens and is observed as law.</span>
	<span>Rulers were the ones who ordered that statues should be worshipped:</span>
	<span>people who could not honour them in person, because they lived too far away,</span>
	<span>would have a portrait made of their distant countenance,</span>
	<span>to have an image that they could see of the king whom they honoured;</span>
	<span>meaning, by such zeal, to flatter the absent as if he were present.</span>
	<span>Even people who did not know him</span>
	<span>were stimulated into spreading his cult by the artist’s enthusiasm;</span>
	<span>for the latter, doubtless wishing to please his ruler,</span>
	<span>exerted all his skill to surpass the reality,</span>
	<span>and the crowd, attracted by the beauty of the work,</span>
	<span>mistook for a god someöne whom recently they had honoured as a man.</span>
	<span>And this became a snare for life:</span>
	<span>that people, whether enslaved by misfortune or by tyranny,</span>
	<span>should have conferred the ineffable Name on sticks and stones.</span>
</p>

<h4>The consequences of idolatry (14:22–31)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>It is not enough, however, for them to have such misconceptions about God;</span>
	<span>for, living in the fierce warfare of ignorance,</span>
	<span>they call these terrible evils peace.</span>
	<span>With their child-murdering rites, their occult mysteries,</span>
	<span>or their frenzied orgies with outlandish customs,</span>
	<span>they no longer retain any purity in their lives or their marriages,</span>
	<span>one treacherously murdering another or wronging him by adultery.</span>
	<span>Everywhere a welter of blood and murder, theft and fraud,</span>
	<span>corruption, treachery, riot, perjury,</span>
	<span>disturbance of decent people, forgetfulness of favours, </span>
	<span>pollution of souls, sins against nature,</span>
	<span>disorder in marriage, adultery and debauchery.</span>
	<span>For the worship of idols with no name</span>
	<span>is the beginning, cause, and end of every evil.</span>
	<span>For these people either carry their merrymaking to the point of frenzy,</span>
	<span>or they prophesy what is not true, or they live wicked lives,</span>
	<span>or they perjure themselves without hesitation;</span>
	<span>since they put their trust in lifeless idols</span>
	<span>they do not reckon their false oaths can harm them.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>But they will be justly punished for this double crime:</span>
	<span>for degrading the concept of God by adhering to idols;</span>
	<span>and for wickedly perjuring themselves in contempt for what is holy.</span>
	<span>For it is not the power of the things by which they swear</span>
	<span>but the punishment reserved for sinners</span>
	<span>that always follows the offences of wicked people.</span>
</p>

<h4 id="ch15">Israel not idolatrous (15:1–6)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>But you, our God, are kind and true,</span>
	<span>slow to anger, governing the universe with mercy.</span>
	<span>Even if we sin, we are yours, since we acknowledge your power,</span>
	<span>but we will not sin, knowing we count as yours.</span>
	<span>To know you is indeed the perfect virtue,</span>
	<span>and to know your power is the root of immortality.</span>
	<span>We have not been duped by inventions of misapplied human skill,</span>
	<span>or by the sterile work of painters,</span>
	<span>by figures daubed with assorted colours,</span>
	<span>the sight of which sets fools yearning</span>
	<span>and hankering for the lifeless form of an unbreathing image.</span>
	<span>Lovers of evil and worthy of such hopes</span>
	<span>are those who make them, those who want them and those who worship them.</span>
</p>

<h4>The makers of idols are fools (15:7–13)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Take a potter, now, laboriously working the soft earth,</span>
	<span>shaping each object for us to use.</span>
	<span>Out of the self-same clay,</span>
	<span>he models vessels intended for a noble use</span>
	<span>and those for a contrary purpose, all alike:</span>
	<span>but which of these two uses each will have</span>
	<span>is for the potter himself to decide.</span>
	<span>Then — ill-spent effort! — from the same clay he models a futile god,</span>
	<span>although so recently made out of earth himself</span>
	<span>and shortly to return to what he was taken from,</span>
	<span>when asked to give back the soul that has been lent to him.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Even so, he does not worry about having to die</span>
	<span>or about the shortness of his life,</span>
	<span>but strives to outdo the goldsmiths and silversmiths,</span>
	<span>imitates the bronzeworkers,</span>
	<span>and prides himself on modelling counterfeits.</span>
	<span>Ashes, his heart;</span>
	<span>more vile than earth, his hope;</span>
	<span>more wretched than clay, his life!</span>
	<span>For he has misconceived the One who has modelled him,</span>
	<span>who breathed an active soul into him</span>
	<span>and inspired a living spirit.</span>
	<span>What is more, he looks on this life of ours as a kind of game,</span>
	<span>and our time here like a fair, full of bargains.</span>
	<span>“However foul the means”, he says, “a man must make a living”.</span>
	<span>He, more than any other, knows he is sinning,</span>
	<span>he who from one earthy stuff makes both brittle pots and idols.</span>
</p>

<h4>The folly of the Egyptians: their indiscriminate idolatry (15:14–19)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>But most foolish, more pitiable even than the soul of a little child,</span>
	<span>are the enemies who once played the tyrant with your people,</span>
	<span>and have taken all the idols of the heathen for gods;</span>
	<span>these can use neither their eyes for seeing</span>
	<span>nor their nostrils for breathing the air</span>
	<span>nor their ears for hearing</span>
	<span>nor the fingers on their hands for handling</span>
	<span>nor their feet for walking.</span>
	<span>They have been made, you see, by a human being,</span>
	<span>modelled by a being whose own breath is borrowed.</span>
	<span>No man can model a god to resemble himself;</span>
	<span>subject to death, his impious hands can produce</span>
	<span>only something dead.</span>
	<span>He himself is worthier than the things he worships;</span>
	<span>he will at least have lived, but never they.</span>
	<span>And they worship even the most loathsome of animals,</span>
	<span>worse than the rest in their degree of stupidity,</span>
	<span>without a trace of beauty — if that is what is attractive in animals —</span>
	<span>and excluded from God’s praises and blessing.</span>
</p>

<h4 id="ch16">Second antithesis: frogs and quails (16:1–4)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Thus they were appropriately punished by similar creatures</span>

	<span>In contrast to this punishment, you did your people a kindness</span>
	<span>and, to satisfy their sharp appetite,</span>
	<span>provided quails — a luscious rarity — for them to eat.</span>
	<span>Thus the Egyptians,</span>
	<span>at the repulsive sight of the creatures sent against them,</span>
	<span>were to find that, though they longed for food,</span>
	<span>they had lost their natural appetite; </span>
	<span>whereäs your own people, after a short privation,</span>
	<span>were to have a rare relish for their portion.</span>
	<span>Inevitable that relentless want should seize on the former oppressors;</span>
	<span>enough for your people to be shown</span>
	<span>how their enemies were being tortured.</span>
</p>

<h4>Third antithesis: locusts and bronze serpent (16:5–14)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Even when the fearful rage of wild animals overtook them</span>
	<span>and they were perishing from the bites of writhing snakes,</span>
	<span>your retribution did not continue to the end.</span>
	<span>Affliction struck them briefly, by way of warning,</span>
	<span>and they had a saving token to remind them of the commandment of your Law,</span>
	<span>for whoëver turned to it was saved, not by what he looked at,</span>
	<span>but by you, the Saviour of all.</span>
	<span>And by such means you proved to our enemies</span>
	<span>that you are the one who delivers from every evil;</span>
	<span>for them, the bites of locusts and flies proved fatal</span>
	<span>and no remedy could be found to save their lives,</span>
	<span>since they deserved to be punished by such creatures.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>But your children,</span>
	<span>not even the fangs of poisonous snakes could bring them down;</span>
	<span>for your mercy came to their help and cured them.</span>
	<span>One sting — how quickly healed! —</span>
	<span>to remind them of your pronouncements</span>
	<span>rather than that, by sinking into deep forgetfulness,</span>
	<span>they should be cut off from your kindness.</span>
	<span>No herb, no poultice cured them,</span>
	<span>but your all-healing word, Lord.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Yes, you are the one with power over life and death,</span>
	<span>bringing to the gates of Hades and back again.</span>
	<span>A human being out of malice may put to death,</span>

<h4>Fourth antithesis: hail and manna (16:15–29)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>It is not possible to escape your hand.</span>
	<span>The godless who refused to acknowledge you</span>
	<span>were scourged by the strength of your arm,</span>
	<span>pursued by no ordinary rains, hail and unrelenting downpours,</span>
	<span>and consumed by fire.</span>
	<span>Even more wonderful, in the water — which quenches all —</span>
	<span>the fire raged fiercer than ever;</span>
	<span>for the elements fight for the upright.</span>
	<span>At one moment, the fire would die down,</span>
	<span>to avoid consuming the animals sent against the godless</span>
	<span>and to make clear to them by that sight, that the sentence of God was pursuing them;</span>
	<span>at another, in the very heart of the water, it would burn more fiercely than fire</span>
	<span>to ruin the produce of a wicked land.</span>
	<span>How differently with your people! You gave them the food of angels,</span>
	<span>from heaven untiringly providing them bread already prepared,</span>
	<span>containing every delight, to satisfy every taste.</span>
	<span>And the substance you gave</span>
	<span>showed your sweetness towards your children,</span>
	<span>for, conforming to the taste of whoëver ate it,</span>
	<span>it transformed itself into what each eater wished.</span>
	<span>Snow and ice endured the fire, without melting;</span>
	<span>this was to show them that, to destroy the harvests of their enemies,</span>
	<span>fire would burn even in hail and flare in falling rain,</span>
	<span>whereäs, on the other hand, it would even forget its own strength</span>
	<span>in the service of feeding the upright.</span>

<p class="poem">
	<span>For the creation, being at the service of you, its Creator,</span>

	<span>And this is why, by changing into all things,</span>
	<span>it obediently served your all-nourishing bounty,</span>
	<span>conforming to the wishes of those who were in need;</span>
	<span>so that your beloved children, Lord, might learn</span>
	<span>that the various crops are not what provide nourishment,</span>
	<span>but your word which preserves all who believe in you.</span>
	<span>For that which fire could not destroy</span>
	<span>melted in the heat of a single fleeting sunbeam,</span>
	<span>to show that, to give you thanks, we must rise before the sun</span>
	<span>and meet you at the dawning of the day;</span>
	<span>whereäs the hope of the ungrateful melts like winter frost</span>
	<span>and flows away like water running to waste.</span>

<h4 id="ch17">Fifth antithesis: darkness and pillar of fire (17:1–18:4)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Yes, your judgements are great and impenetrable,</span>
	<span>which is why uninstructed souls have gone astray.</span>
	<span>While the wicked supposed they had a holy nation in their power,</span>
	<span>they themselves lay prisoners of the dark, in the fetters of long night,</span>
	<span>confined under their own roofs, banished from eternal providence.</span>
	<span>While they thought to remain unnoticed with their secret sins,</span>
	<span>curtained by dark forgetfulness,</span>
	<span>they were scattered in fearful dismay,</span>
	<span>terrified by apparitions.</span>
	<span>The hiding place sheltering them could not ward off their fear;</span>
	<span>terrifying noises echoed around them;</span>
	<span>and gloomy, grim-faced spectres haunted them.</span>
	<span>No fire had power enough to give them light,</span>
	<span>nor could the brightly blazing stars</span>
	<span>illuminate that dreadful night.</span>
	<span>The only light for them was a great, spontaneous blaze —</span>
	<span>a fearful sight to see!</span>
	<span>And in their terror, once that sight had vanished,</span>
	<span>they thought what they had seen more terrible than ever.</span>
	<span>Their magical illusions were powerless now,</span>
	<span>and their claims to intelligence were ignominiously confounded;</span>
	<span>for those who promised to drive out fears and disorders from sick souls</span>
	<span>were now themselves sick with ludicrous fright.</span>
	<span>Even when there was nothing frightful to scare them,</span>
	<span>the vermin creeping past and the hissing of reptiles filled them with panic;</span>
	<span>they died convulsed with fright,</span>
	<span>refusing even to look at empty air, which cannot be eluded anyhow!</span>
	<span>Wickedness is confessedly very cowardly, and it condemns itself;</span>
	<span>under pressure from conscience it always assumes the worst.</span>
	<span>Fear, indeed, is nothing other</span>
	<span>than the failure of the help offered by reason;</span>
	<span>the less you rely within yourself on this,</span>
	<span>the more alarming it is not to know the cause of your suffering.</span>
	<span>And they, all locked in the same sleep,</span>
	<span>while that darkness lasted — which was in fact quite powerless</span>
	<span>and had issued from the depths of equally powerless Hades —</span>
	<span>were now chased by monstrous spectres,</span>
	<span>now paralysed by the fainting of their souls;</span>
	<span>for a sudden, unexpected terror had attacked them.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>And thus, whoëver it might be that fell there</span>

	<span>Whether he was ploughman or shepherd,</span>
	<span>or somebody at work in the desert,</span>
	<span>he was still overtaken and suffered the inevitable fate,</span>
	<span>for all had been bound by the one same chain of darkness.</span>
	<span>The soughing of the wind,</span>
	<span>the tuneful noise of birds in the spreading branches,</span>
	<span>the measured beat of water in its powerful course,</span>
	<span>the headlong din of rocks cascading down,</span>
	<span>the unseen course of bounding animals,</span>
	<span>the roaring of the most savage of wild beasts,</span>
	<span>the echo rebounding from the clefts in the mountains,</span>
	<span>all held them paralysed with fear.</span>
	<span>For the whole world shone with the light of day</span>
	<span>and, unhindered, went about its work;</span>
	<span>over them alone there spread a heavy darkness,</span>
	<span>image of the dark that would receive them.</span>
	<span>But heavier than the darkness was the burden they were to themselves.</span>

<p class="poem" id="ch18">
	<span>For your holy ones, however, there was a very great light.</span>

	<span>they thanked them for doing no injury in return for previous wrongs</span>
	<span>and asked forgiveness for their past ill-will.</span>
	<span>In contrast to the darkness, you gave your people a pillar of blazing fire</span>
	<span>to guide them on their unknown journey,</span>
	<span>a mild sun for their ambitious migration.</span>
	<span>But well those others deserved to be deprived of light</span>
	<span>and imprisoned in darkness,</span>
	<span>for they had kept in captivity your children,</span>
	<span>by whom the incorruptible light of the Law was to be given to the world.</span>

<h4>Sixth antithesis: night of bereavement and night of deliverance (18:5–19)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>As they had resolved to kill the infants of the holy ones,</span>
	<span>and as of those exposed only one child had been saved,</span>
	<span>you punished them by carrying off their horde of children</span>
	<span>and by destroying them all in the wild water.</span>
	<span>That night had been known in advance to our ancestors,</span>
	<span>so that, well knowing him in whom they had put their trust, they would be sure of his promises.</span>
	<span>Your people thus were waiting</span>
	<span>both for the rescue of the upright and for the ruin of the enemy;</span>
	<span>for by the very vengeance that you exacted on our adversaries,</span>
	<span>you glorified us by calling us to you.</span>
	<span>So the holy children of the good offered sacrifice in secret</span>
	<span>and with one accord enacted this holy law:</span>
	<span>that the holy ones should share good things and dangers alike;</span>
	<span>and forthwith they chanted the hymns of the ancestors.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>In echo came the discordant cries of their enemies,</span>

	<span>and now commoner and king had the same sufferings to endure.</span>
	<span>Struck by the same death, all had innumerable dead.</span>
	<span>There were not enough living left to bury them,</span>
	<span>for, at one stroke, the flower of their offspring had perished.</span>
	<span>Those whose spells had made them completely incredulous,</span>
	<span>when faced with the destruction of their first-born,</span>
	<span>acknowledged this people to be child of God.</span>

	<span>like a pitiless warrior into the heart of a land doomed to destruction.</span>
	<span>Carrying your unambiguous command like a sharp sword,</span>
	<span>it stood, and filled the universe with death;</span>
	<span>though standing on the earth, it touched the sky.</span>
	<span>Immediately, dreams and gruesome visions</span>
	<span>overwhelmed them with terror,</span>
	<span>unexpected fears assailed them.</span>
	<span>Hurled down, some here, some there, half dead,</span>
	<span>they were able to say why they were dying;</span>
	<span>for the dreams that had troubled them</span>
	<span>had warned them why beforehand,</span>

<h4>Threat of annihilation in the desert (18:20–25)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Experience of death, however, touched the upright too,</span>

	<span>Wielding the weapons of his sacred office,</span>
	<span>prayer and expiating incense,</span>
	<span>he confronted Retribution and put an end to the plague,</span>
	<span>thus showing that he was your servant.</span>
	<span>He overcame Hostility, not by physical strength,</span>
	<span>nor by force of arms;</span>
	<span>but by word he prevailed over the Punisher,</span>
	<span>by recalling the oaths made to the Fathers, and the covenants.</span>
	<span>Already the corpses lay piled in heaps,</span>
	<span>when he interposed and beat Retribution back</span>
	<span>and cut off its approach to the living.</span>
	<span>For the whole world was on his flowing robe,</span>
	<span>the glorious names of the Fathers engraved on the four rows of stones,</span>

	<span>Later they were to see a new way for birds to come into being,</span>

	<span>and they suffered what their own crimes had justly deserved</span>
	<span>since they had shown such bitter hatred to foreigners.</span>
	<span>Others, indeed, had failed to welcome strangers who came to them,</span>
	<span>but the Egyptians had enslaved their own guests and benefactors.</span>
	<span>The sinners, moreöver, will certainly be punished for it, </span>
	<span>since they gave the foreigners a hostile welcome;</span>
	<span>but the latter, having given a festive reception</span>
	<span>to people who already shared the same rights as themselves,</span>
	<span>later overwhelmed them with terrible labours.</span>
	<span>Hence they were struck with blindness,</span>
	<span>like the sinners at the gate of the upright,</span>
	<span>when, yawning darkness all around them,</span>
	<span>each had to grope his way through his own door.</span>

<h4>A new harmony in nature (19:18–21)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>A new attuning of the elements occurred,</span>
	<span>as on a harp the notes may change their rhythm,</span>
	<span>though all the while preserving the same tone;</span>
	<span>and this is just what happened:</span>
	<span>land animals became aquatic,</span>
	<span>swimming ones took to the land,</span>
	<span>fire reïnforced its strength in water,</span>
	<span>and water forgot the power of extinguishing it;</span>
	<span>flames, on the other hand, did not char the flesh</span>
	<span>of delicate animals that ventured into them;</span>
	<span>nor did they melt the heavenly food </span>
	<span>resembling ice and as easily melted.</span>

<h4>Conclusion (19:22)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Yes, Lord, in every way you have made your people great and glorious;</span>
	<span>you have never failed to help them at any time or place.</span>
