Sir 1:1 [The Law, the Prophets, and the other writers succeeding them have passed on to us great lessons, in
consequence of which Israel must be commended for learning and wisdom. Furthermore, it is a duty, not only to
acquire learning by reading, but also, once having acquired it, to make oneself of use to people outsideby what
one can say or write. My grandfather Jesus, having long devoted himself to the readingof the Law, the
Prophets and other books of the Fathersand having become very learned in them, himself decided to write
something on the subjects of learning and wisdom, so that people who wanted to learn might, by themselves
accepting these disciplines, learn how better to live according to the Law.You are therefore askedto read this
bookwith good will and attentionand to show indulgencein those places where, notwithstanding our efforts at
interpretation, we may seemto have failed to give an adequate rendering of this or that expression;the fact is that
there is no equivalentfor things originally written in Hebrew when it is a question of translating them into another
language;what is more, the Law itself, the Prophets and the other booksdiffer considerably in translation from
what appears in the original text. It was in the thirty-eighth year of the late King Euergetesthat, coming to Egypt
and spending some time here, and finding life here consistent with a high degree of wisdom, I became convinced
of an immediate duty to apply myself in my turn with pains and diligence to the translation of the book that
follows;and I spent much time and learning on itin the course of this period, to complete the work and to publish
the bookfor the benefit of those too who, domiciled abroad, wish to study, to reform their behaviour, and to live as
the Law requires.] All wisdom comes from the Lord, she is with him for ever.

Sir 1 :2 The sands of the sea, the drops of rain, the days of eternity — who can count them?

Sir 1 :3 The height of the sky, the breadth of the earth, the depth of the abyss — who can explore them?

Sir 1 :4 Wisdom was created before everything, prudent understanding subsists from remotest ages.

Sir 1:5

Sir 1 :6 For whom has the root of wisdom ever been uncovered? Her resourceful ways, who knows them?

Sir 1:7

Sir 1 :8 One only is wise, terrible indeed,

Sir 1 :9 seated on his throne, the Lord. It was he who created, inspected and weighed her up, and then poured
her out on all his works-

Sir 1:10 as much to each living creature as he chose — bestowing her on those who love him.

Sir 1:11 The fear of the Lord is glory and pride, happiness and a crown of joyfulness.

Sir 1:12 The fear of the Lord gladdens the heart, giving happiness, joy and long life.

Sir 1:13 For those who fear the Lord, all will end well: on their dying day they will be blessed.

Sir 1:14 The basis of wisdom is to fear the Lord; she was created with the faithful in their mothers’ womb;

Sir 1:15 she has made a home in the human race, an age - old foundation, and to their descendants will she
faithfully cling.

Sir 1:16 The fullness of wisdom is to fear the Lord; she intoxicates them with her fruits;

Sir 1:17 she fills their entire house with treasures and their storerooms with her produce.

Sir 1:18 The crown of wisdom is to fear the Lord: she makes peace and health flourish.

Sir 1:19 The Lord has seen and assessed her, he has showered down knowledge and intelligence, he has
exalted the renown of those who possess her.

Sir 1 :20 The root of wisdom is to fear the Lord, and her branches are long life.

Sir 1:21

Sir 1 :22 The rage of the wicked cannot put him in the right, for the weight of his rage is his downfall.

Sir 1 :23 A patient person puts up with things until the right time comes: but his joy will break out in the end.

Sir 1 :24 until the time comes he keeps his thoughts to himself, and many a lip will affirm how wise he is.

Sir 1 :25 Wisdom’s treasuries contain the maxims of knowledge, the sinner, however, holds piety in abhorrence.



Sir 1 :26 If you desire wisdom, keep the commandments, and the Lord will bestow it on you.

Sir 1 :27 For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and instruction, and what pleases him is faithfulness and gentleness.
Sir 1 :28 Do not stand out against fear of the Lord, do not practise it with a double heart.

Sir 1 :29 Do not act a part in public, keep watch over your lips.

Sir 1 :30 Do not grow too high and mighty, for fear you fall and cover yourself in disgrace; for the Lord would
then reveal your secrets and overthrow you before the whole community for not having practised fear of the Lord
and for having a heart full of deceit.

Sir 2:1 My child, if you aspire to serve the Lord, prepare yourself for an ordeal.

Sir 2:2 Be sincere of heart, be steadfast, and do not be alarmed when disaster comes.

Sir 2:3 Cling to him and do not leave him, so that you may be honoured at the end of your days.

Sir 2:4 Whatever happens to you, accept it, and in the uncertainties of your humble state, be patient,

Sir 2:5 since gold is tested in the fire, and the chosen in the furnace of humiliation.

Sir 2:6 Trust him and he will uphold you, follow a straight path and hope in him.

Sir 2:7 You who fear the Lord, wait for his mercy; do not turn aside, for fear you fall.

Sir 2:8 You who fear the Lord, trust him, and you will not be robbed of your reward.

Sir 2:9 You who fear the Lord, hope for those good gifts of his, everlasting joy and mercy.

Sir 2:10 Look at the generations of old and see: whoëver trusted in the Lord and was put to shame? Or
whoëver, steadfastly fearing him, was forsaken? Or whoëver called to him and was ignored?

Sir 2:1 1 For the Lord is compassionate and merciful, he forgives sins and saves in the time of distress.

Sir 2:12 Woe to faint hearts and listless hands, and to the sinner who treads two paths.

Sir 2:13 Woe to the listless heart that has no faith, for such will have no protection.

Sir 2:14 Woe to you who have lost the strength to endure; what will you do at the Lord’s visitation?

Sir 2:15 Those who fear the Lord do not disdain his words, and those who love him keep his ways.

Sir 2:16 Those who fear the Lord do their best to please him, and those who love him will find satisfaction in the
Law.

Sir 2:17 Those who fear the Lord keep their hearts prepared and humble themselves in his presence.

Sir 2:18 Let us fall into the hands of the Lord, not into any human clutches; for as his majesty is, so too is his
mercy.

Sir 3:1 Children, listen to me for I am your father: do what I tell you, and so be safe;

Sir 3:2 for the Lord honours the father above his children and upholds the rights of a mother over her sons.

Sir 3:3 Whoëver respects a father expiates sins,

Sir 3:4 whoëver honours a mother is like someöne amassing a fortune.

Sir 3:5 Whoëver respects a father will in turn be happy with children, the day he prays for help, he will be heard.
Sir 3:6 Long life comes to anyone who honours a father, whoëver obeys the Lord makes a mother happy.

Sir 3:7 Such a one serves parents as well as the Lord.

Sir 3:8 Respect your father in deed as well as word, so that blessing may come on you from him;

Sir 3:9 since a father’s blessing makes his children’s house firm, while a mother’s curse tears up its foundations.
Sir 3:10 Do not make a boast of disgrace overtaking your father, your father’s disgrace reflects no honour on
you;

Sir 3:1 1 for a person’s own honour derives from the respect shown to his father, and a mother held in dishonour
is a reproach to her children.

Sir 3:12 My child, support your father in his old age, do not grieve him during his life.

Sir 3:13 Even if his mind should fail, show him sympathy, do not despise him in your health and strength;

Sir 3:14 for kindness to a father will not be forgotten but will serve as reparation for your sins.

Sir 3:15 On your own day of ordeal God will remember you: like frost in sunshine, your sins will melt away.

Sir 3:16 Whoëver deserts a father is no better than a blasphemer, and whoëver distresses a mother is accursed
of the Lord.

Sir 3:17 My child, be gentle in carrying out your business, and you will be better loved than a lavish giver.

Sir 3:18 The greater you are, the more humbly you should behave, and then you will find favour with the Lord;
Sir 3:19

Sir 3:20 for great though the power of the Lord is, he accepts the homage of the humble.

Sir 3:21 Do not try to understand things that are too difficult for you, or try to discover what is beyond your
powers.

Sir 3:22 Concentrate on what has been assigned you, you have no need to worry over mysteries.

Sir 3:23 Do not meddle with matters that are beyond you; what you have been taught already exceeds the
scope of the human mind.

Sir 3:24 For many have been misled by their own notions, wicked presumption having warped their judgement.
Sir 3:25

Sir 3:26 A stubborn heart will come to a bad end, and whoëver dallies with danger will perish in it.



Sir 3:27 A stubborn heart is weighed down with troubles, the sinner heaps sin on sin.

Sir 3:28 For the disease of the proud there is no cure, since an evil growth has taken root there.

Sir 3:29 The heart of the sensible will reflect on parables, an attentive ear is the sage’s dream.

Sir 3:30 Water puts out a blazing fire, almsgiving expiates sins.

Sir 3:31 Whoëver gives favours in return is mindful of the future; at the moment of falling, such a person will find
support.

Sir 4:1 My child, do not refuse the poor a livelihood, do not tantalise the needy.

Sir 4:2 Do not add to the sufferings of the hungry, do not bait anyone in distress.

Sir 4:3 Do not aggravate a heart already angry, nor keep the destitute waiting for your alms.

Sir 4:4 Do not repulse a hard-pressed beggar, nor turn your face from the poor.

Sir 4:5 Do not avert your eyes from the needy, give no one occasion to curse you;

Sir 4:6 for if someöne curses you in distress, his Maker will give ear to the imprecation.

Sir 4:7 Gain the love of the community, in the presence of the great bow your head.

Sir 4:8 To the poor lend an ear, and courteously return the greeting.

Sir 4:9 Save the oppressed from the hand of the oppressor, and do not be mean-spirited in your judgements.

Sir 4:10 Be like a father to the fatherless and as good as a husband to their mothers. And you will be like a child
to the Most High, who will love you more than your own mother does.

Sir 4:1 1 Wisdom brings up her own children and cares for those who seek her.

Sir 4:12 Whoëver loves her loves life, those who seek her early will be filled with joy.

Sir 4:13 Whoëver possesses her will inherit honour, and wherever he walks the Lord will bless him.

Sir 4:14 Those who serve her minister to the Holy One, and the Lord loves those who love her.

Sir 4:15 Whoëver obeys her rules the nations, whoëver pays attention to her dwells secure.

Sir 4:16 If he trusts himself to her he will inherit her, and his descendants will remain in possession of her;

Sir 4:17 for though she takes him at first through winding ways, bringing fear and faintness on him, trying him
out with her discipline until she can trust him, and testing him with her ordeals,

Sir 4:18 she then comes back to him on the straight road, makes him happy and reveals her secrets to him.

Sir 4:19 If he goes astray, however, she abandons him and leaves him to his own destruction.

Sir 4:20 Take circumstances into account and beware of evil, and have no cause to be ashamed of yourself;

Sir 4:21 for there is a shame that leads to sin and a shame that is honourable and gracious.

Sir 4:22 Do not be too severe on yourself, do not let shame lead you to ruin.

Sir 4:23 Do not refrain from speaking when it will do good, and do not hide your wisdom;

Sir 4:24 for your wisdom is made known by what you say, your erudition by the words you utter.

Sir 4:25 Do not contradict the truth, rather blush for your own ignorance.

Sir 4:26 Do not be ashamed to confess your sins, do not struggle against the current of the river.

Sir 4:27 Do not grovel to the foolish, do not show partiality to the influential.

Sir 4:28 Fight to the death for truth, and the Lord God will war on your side.

Sir 4:29 Do not be bold of tongue, yet idle and slack in deed;

Sir 4:30 do not be like a lion at home, or cowardly towards your servants.

Sir 4:31 Do not let your hands be outstretched to receive, yet tight-fisted when the time comes to give back.

Sir 5:1 Do not put your confidence in your money or say, “With this I am self-sufficient”.

Sir 5:2 Do not be led by your appetites and energy to follow the passions of your heart.

Sir 5:3 And do not say, “Who has authority over me?”. for the Lord will certainly give you your deserts.

Sir 5:4 Do not say, “I have sinned, but what harm has befallen me?”. for the Lord’s forbearance is long.

Sir 5:5 Do not be so sure of forgiveness that you add sin to sin.

Sir 5:6 And do not say, “His compassion is great, he will forgive me my many sins”; for with him are both mercy
and retribution, and his anger does not pass from sinners.

Sir 5:7 Do not delay your return to the Lord, do not put it off day after day; for suddenly the Lord’s wrath will
blaze out, and on the day of punishment you will be utterly destroyed.

Sir 5:8 Do not set your heart on ill-gotten gains, they will be of no use to you on the day of disaster.

Sir 5:9 Do not winnow in every wind, or walk along every by-way (as the double-talking sinner does).

Sir 5:10 Be steady in your convictions, and be a person of your word.

Sir 5:1 1 Be quick to listen, and deliberate in giving an answer.

Sir 5:12 If you understand the matter, give your neighbour an answer, if not, keep your hand over your mouth.
Sir 5:13 Both honour and disgrace come from talking, the tongue is its owner’s downfall.

Sir 5:14 Do not get a name for scandal-mongering, do not set traps with your tongue; for as shame lies in store
for the thief, so harsh condemnation awaits the deceitful.

Sir 5:15 Avoid offences in great as in small matters, and do not exchange friendship for enmity,

Sir 6:1 for a bad name will earn you shame and reproach, as happens to the double-talking sinner.

Sir 6:2 Do not get carried aloft on the wings of passion, for fear your strength tear itself apart like a bull,



Sir 6:3 and you devour your own foliage and destroy your own fruit and end by making yourself like a piece of
dried-up wood.

Sir 6:4 An evil temper destroys the person who has it and makes him the laughing-stock of his enemies.

Sir 6:5 A kindly turn of speech attracts new friends, a courteous tongue invites many a friendly response.

Sir 6:6 Let your acquaintances be many, but for advisers choose one out of a thousand.

Sir 6:7 If you want to make a friend, take him on trial, and do not be in a hurry to trust him;

Sir 6:8 for one kind of friend is so only when it suits him but will not stand by you in your day of trouble.

Sir 6:9 Another kind of friend will fall out with you and to your dismay make your quarrel public,

Sir 6:10 and a third kind of friend will share your table, but not stand by you in your day of trouble:

Sir 6:1 1 when you are doing well he will be your second self, ordering your servants about;

Sir 6:12 but, if disaster befalls you, he will recoil from you and keep out of your way.

Sir 6:13 Keep well clear of your enemies, and be wary of your friends.

Sir 6:14 A loyal friend is a powerful defence: whoëver finds one has indeed found a treasure.

Sir 6:15 A loyal friend is something beyond price, there is no measuring his worth.

Sir 6:16 A loyal friend is the elixir of life, and those who fear the Lord will find one.

Sir 6:17 Whoëver fears the Lord makes true friends, for as a person is, so is his friend too.

Sir 6:18 My child, from your earliest youth choose instruction, and until your hair is white you will keep finding
wisdom.

Sir 6:19 Like ploughman and sower, cultivate her and wait for her fine harvest, for in tilling her you will toil a little
while, but very soon you will be eating her crops.

Sir 6:20 How very harsh she is to the undisciplined! The senseless does not stay with her for long:

Sir 6:21 she will weigh as heavily on the senseless as a touchstone and such a person will lose no time in
throwing her off;

Sir 6:22 for Wisdom is true to her name, she is not accessible to many.

Sir 6:23 Listen, my child, and take my advice, do not reject my counsel:

Sir 6:24 put your feet into her fetters, and your neck into her collar;

Sir 6:25 offer your shoulder to her burden, do not be impatient of her bonds;

Sir 6:26 court her with all your soul, and with all your might keep in her ways;

Sir 6:27 search for her, track her down: she will reveal herself; once you hold her, do not let her go.

Sir 6:28 For in the end you will find rest in her and she will take the form of joy for you:

Sir 6:29 her fetters you will find a mighty defence, her collars, a precious necklace.

Sir 6:30 Her yoke will be a golden ornament, and her bonds be purple ribbons;

Sir 6:31 you will wear her like a robe of honour, you will put her on like a crown of joy.

Sir 6:32 If you wish it, my child, you can be taught; apply yourself, and you will become intelligent.

Sir 6:33 If you love listening, you will learn, if you pay attention, you will become wise.

Sir 6:34 Attend the gathering of elders; if there is a wise man there, attach yourself to him.

Sir 6:35 Listen willingly to any discourse coming from God, do not let wise proverbs escape you.

Sir 6:36 If you see a man of understanding, visit him early, let your feet wear out his doorstep.

Sir 6:37 Reflect on the injunctions of the Lord, busy yourself at all times with his commandments. He will
strengthen your mind, and the wisdom you desire will be granted you.

Sir 7:1 Do no evil, and evil will not befall you;

Sir 7:2 shun wrong, and it will avoid you.

Sir 7:3 My child, do not sow in the furrows of wickedness, for fear you have to reap them seven times over.

Sir 7:4 Do not ask the Lord for the highest place, or the king for a seat of honour.

Sir 7:5 Do not parade your uprightness before the Lord, or your wisdom before the king.

Sir 7:6 Do not scheme to be appointed judge, for fear you should not be strong enough to stamp out injustice,

for fear of being swayed by someöne influential and so of risking the loss of your integrity.

Sir 7:7 Do not wrong the general body of citizens and so lower yourself in popular esteem.

Sir 7:8 Do not be drawn to sin twice over, for you will not go unpunished even once.

Sir 7:9 Do not say, “God will be impressed by my numerous offerings; when I sacrifice to God Most High, he is

bound to accept”.

Sir 7:10 Do not be hesitant in prayer; do not neglect to give alms.

Sir 7:1 1 Do not laugh at someöne who is sad of heart, for he who brings low can lift up high.

Sir 7:12 Do not make up lies against your brother, nor against a friend either.

Sir 7:13 Mind you tell no lies, for no good can come of it.

Sir 7:14 Do not talk too much at the gathering of elders, and do not repeat yourself at your prayers.

Sir 7:15 Do not shirk tiring jobs or farm work, ordained by the Most High.

Sir 7:16 Do not swell the ranks of sinners, remember that the retribution will not delay.

Sir 7:17 Be very humble, since the recompense for the godless is fire and worms.



Sir 7:18 Do not barter a friend away for the sake of profit, nor a true brother for the gold of Ophir.

Sir 7:19 Do not turn against a wise and good wife; her gracious presence is worth more than gold.

Sir 7:20 Do not ill-treat a slave who is an honest worker, or a wage-earner who is devoted to you.

Sir 7:21 Love an intelligent slave with all your heart, and do not deny such a slave his freedom.

Sir 7:22 Have you cattle? Look after them; if they are making you a profit, keep them.

Sir 7:23 Have you children? Educate them, from childhood make them bow the neck.

Sir 7:24 Have you daughters? Take care of their bodies, but do not be over-indulgent.

Sir 7:25 Marry a daughter off, and you have finished a great work; but give her to a man of sense.

Sir 7:26 Have you a wife to your liking? Do not turn her out; but if you do not love her, never trust her.

Sir 7:27 With all your heart honour your father, never forget the birthpangs of your mother.

Sir 7:28 Remember that you owe your birth to them; how can you repay them for what they have done for you?
Sir 7:29 With all your soul, fear the Lord and revere his priests.

Sir 7:30 With all your might love him who made you, and do not abandon his ministers.

Sir 7:31 Fear the Lord and honour the priest and give him the portion enjoined on you: first-fruits, sacrifice of
reparation, shoulder-gift, sanctification sacrifice, first-fruits of the holy things.

Sir 7:32 And also give generously to the poor, so that your blessing may lack nothing.

Sir 7:33 Let your generosity extend to all the living, do not withhold it even from the dead.

Sir 7:34 Do not turn your back on those who weep, but share the grief of the grief-stricken.

Sir 7:35 Do not shrink from visiting the sick; in this way you will make yourself loved.

Sir 7:36 In everything you do, remember your end, and you will never sin.

Sir 8:1 Do not try conclusions with anyone influential, in case you later fall into his clutches.

Sir 8:2 Do not quarrel with anyone rich, in case he puts his weight against you; for gold has destroyed many,
and has swayed the hearts of kings.

Sir 8:3 Do not argue with anyone argumentative, do not pile wood on that fire.

Sir 8:4 Do not joke with anyone uncouth, for fear of hearing your ancestors insulted.

Sir 8:5 Do not revile a repentant sinner; remember that we all are guilty.

Sir 8:6 Do not despise anyone in old age; after all, some of us too are growing old.

Sir 8:7 Do not gloat over anyone’s death; remember that we all have to die.

Sir 8:8 Do not scorn the discourse of the wise, but make yourself familiar with their maxims, since from these
you will learn the theory and the art of serving the great.

Sir 8:9 Do not dismiss what the old people have to say, for they too were taught by their parents; from them you
will learn how to think, and the art of the timely answer.

Sir 8:10 Do not kindle the coals of the sinner, in case you scorch yourself in his blaze.

Sir 8:11 Refuse to be provoked by the insolent, for fear that such a one try to trap you in your words.

Sir 8:12 Do not lend to anyone who is stronger than you are — if you do lend, resign yourself to loss.

Sir 8:13 Do not stand surety beyond your means; if you do stand surety, be prepared to pay up.

Sir 8:14 Do not go to law with a judge, since judgement will be given in his favour.

Sir 8:15 Do not go travelling with a rash man, for fear he becomes burdensome to you; he will act as the whim
takes him, and you will both be ruined by his folly.

Sir 8:16 Do not argue with a quick-tempered man, do not go with him where there are no other people, since
blood counts for nothing in his eyes, and where no help is to be had, he will strike you down.

Sir 8:17 Do not ask a fool for advice, since a fool will not be able to keep a confidence.

Sir 8:18 In a stranger’s presence do nothing that should be kept secret, since you cannot tell what use the
stranger will make of it.

Sir 8:19 Do not open your heart to all comers, nor lay claim to their good offices.

Sir 9:1 Do not be jealous of the wife you love, do not teach her lessons in how to harm you.

Sir 9:2 Do not put yourself in a woman’s hands or she may come to dominate you completely.

Sir 9:3 Do not keep company with a prostitute, in case you get entangled in her snares.

Sir 9:4 Do not dally with a singing girl, in case you get caught by her wiles.

Sir 9:5 Do not stare at a pretty girl, in case you and she incur the same punishment.

Sir 9:6 Do not give your heart to whores, or you will ruin your inheritance.

Sir 9:7 Keep your eyes to yourself in the streets of a town, do not prowl about its unfrequented quarters.

Sir 9:8 Turn your eyes away from a handsome woman, do not stare at a beauty belonging to someöne else.
Because of a woman’s beauty, many have been undone; this makes passion flare up like a fire.

Sir 9:9 Never sit down with a married woman, or sit at table with her drinking wine, in case you let your heart
succumb to her and you lose all self-control and slide to disaster.

Sir 9:10 Do not desert an old friend; the new one will not be his match. New friend, new wine; when it grows old,
you drink it with pleasure.

Sir 9:1 1 Do not envy the sinner his success; you do not know how that will end.



Sir 9:12 Do not take pleasure in what pleases the godless; remember they will not go unpunished here below.

Sir 9:13 Keep your distance from the man who has the power to put to death, and you will not be haunted by the
fear of dying. If you do approach him, make no false move, or he may take your life. Realise that you are
treading among trip-lines, that you are strolling on the battlements.

Sir 9:14 Cultivate your neighbours to the best of your ability, and consult with the wise.

Sir 9:15 For conversation seek the intelligent, let all your discussions bear on the law of the Most High.

Sir 9:16 Have the upright for your table companions, and let your pride be in fearing the Lord.

Sir 9:17 Work from skilled hands will earn its praise, but a leader of the people must be skilful in words.

Sir 9:18 A chatterbox is a terror to his town, a loose talker is detested.

Sir 10:1 A sagacious ruler educates his people, and he makes his subjects understand order.

Sir 10:2 As the magistrate is, so will his officials be, as the governor is, so will be the inhabitants of his city.

Sir 10:3 An undisciplined king will be the ruin of his people, a city owes its prosperity to the intelligence of its
leading men.

Sir 1 0:4 The government of the earth is in the hands of the Lord, he sets the right leader over it at the right time.
Sir 10:5 Human success is in the hands of the Lord. He invests the scribe with honour.

Sir 1 0:6 Do not resent your neighbour’s every offence, and never act in a fit of passion.

Sir 10:7 Pride is hateful to God and humanity, and injustice is abhorrent to both.

Sir 10:8 Sovereignty passes from nation to nation because of injustice, arrogance and money.

Sir 1 0:9 What has dust and ashes to pride itself on? Even in life its entrails are repellent.

Sir 10:10 A long illness makes a fool of the doctor; a king today is a corpse tomorrow.

Sir 10:1 1 For in death the portion of all alike will be insects, wild animals and worms.

Sir 10:12 The first stage of pride is to desert the Lord and to turn one’s heart away from one’s Maker.

Sir 10:13 Since the first stage of pride is sin, whoëver clings to it will pour forth filth. This is why the Lord inflicts
unexpected punishments on such people, utterly destroying them.

Sir 10:14 The Lord has turned mighty princes off their thrones and seated the humble there instead.

Sir 10:15 The Lord has plucked up the proud by the roots, and planted the lowly in their place.

Sir 10:16 The Lord has overthrown the lands of the nations and destroyed them to the very foundations of the
earth.

Sir 10:17 Sometimes he has taken them away and destroyed them, and blotted out their memory from the earth.
Sir 10:18 Pride was not created for human beings, nor furious rage for those born of woman.

Sir 10:19 What race deserves honour? The human race. What race deserves honour? Those who fear the Lord.
What race deserves contempt? The human race. What race deserves contempt? Those who break the Law.

Sir 1 0:20 A leader is honoured by his brothers, and those who fear the Lord are honoured by him.

Sir 10:21

Sir 10:22 The rich, the noble, the poor, let them pride themselves on fearing the Lord.

Sir 1 0:23 It is not right to despise one who is poor but intelligent, and it is not good to honour one who is a
sinner.

Sir 10:24 Magnate, magistrate, potentate, all are to be honoured, but none is greater than the one who fears the
Lord.

Sir 10:25 A wise slave will have free men waiting on him, and the enlightened will not complain.

Sir 1 0:26 Do not try to be smart when you do your work, do not put on airs when you are in difficulties.

Sir 10:27 Better the hardworking who has plenty of everything, than the pretentious at a loss for a meal.

Sir 1 0:28 My child, be modest in your self-esteem, and value yourself at your proper worth.

Sir 1 0:29 Who can justify one who inflicts injuries on himself, or respect one who is full of self-contempt?

Sir 1 0:30 The poor is honoured for wit, and the rich for wealth.

Sir 10:31 Honoured in poverty, how much the more in wealth! Dishonoured in wealth, how much the more in
poverty!

Sir 11:1 Wisdom enables the poor to stand erect, and gives to the poor a place with the great.

Sir 1 1 :2 Do not praise anyone for good looks, nor dislike anyone for mere appearance.

Sir 1 1 :3 Small among winged creatures is the bee but her produce is the sweetest of the sweet.

Sir 1 1 :4 Do not grow proud when people honour you; for the works of the Lord are wonderful but hidden from
human beings.

Sir 1 1 :5 Many monarchs have been made to sit on the ground, and the person nobody thought of has worn the
crown.

Sir 1 1 :6 Many influential people have been utterly disgraced, and prominent people have fallen into the power of
others.

Sir 11:7 Do not find fault before making thorough enquiry; first reflect, then give a reprimand.

Sir 1 1 :8 Listen before you answer, and do not interrupt a speech before it is finished.

Sir 11:9 Do not wrangle about something that does not concern you, do not interfere in the quarrels of sinners.



Sir 11:10 My child, do not take on a great amount of business; if you multiply your interests, you are bound to
suffer for it; hurry as fast as you can, yet you will never arrive, nor will you escape by running away.

Sir 11:11 Some people work very hard at top speed, only to find themselves falling further behind.

Sir 11:12 Or there is the slow kind of person, needing help, poor in possessions and rich in poverty; and the
Lord turns a favourable eye on him, lifts him out of his wretched condition,

Sir 11:13 and enables him to hold his head high, thus causing general astonishment.

Sir 11:14 Good and bad, life and death, poverty and wealth, all come from the Lord.

Sir 11:15
Sir 11:16

Sir 11:17 To the devout the Lord’s gift remains constant, and his favour will be there to lead them for ever.

Sir 11:18 Others grow rich by pinching and scraping, and here is the reward they receive for it:

Sir 1 1:19 although they say, “Now I can sit back and enjoy the benefit of what I have got”, they do not know how
long this will last; they will have to leave their goods to others and die.

Sir 1 1 :20 Stick to your job, work hard at it and grow old at your work.

Sir 1 1 :21 Do not admire the achievements of sinners, trust the Lord and mind your own business; since it is a
trifle in the eyes of the Lord, in a moment, suddenly to make the poor rich.

Sir 1 1 :22 The blessing of the Lord is the reward of the devout, in a moment God brings his blessing to flower.

Sir 1 1 :23 Do not say, “What are my needs, how much shall I have in the future?”.

Sir 1 1 :24 And do not say, “I am self-sufficient, what disaster can affect me now?”.

Sir 1 1 :25 In prosperous times, disasters are forgotten and in times of disaster, no one remembers prosperity.

Sir 1 1 :26 Yet it is a trifle for the Lord on the day someöne dies to repay him as his conduct deserves.

Sir 1 1:27 A moment’s adversity, and pleasures are forgotten; in a person’s last hour his deeds will stand
revealed.

Sir 1 1 :28 Call no one fortunate before his death; it is by his end that someöne will be known.

Sir 1 1 :29 Do not bring everyone home with you, for many are the traps of the crafty.

Sir 1 1 :30 Like a captive partridge in a cage, so is the heart of the proud: like a spy he watches for your downfall,
Sir 1 1 :31 ever on the look-out, turning good into bad and finding fault with what is praiseworthy.

Sir 1 1 :32 A hearthful of glowing coals starts from a single spark, and the sinner lurks for the chance to spill
blood.

Sir 1 1 :33 Beware of a scoundrel and his evil contrivances, in case he puts a smear on you for ever.

Sir 1 1 :34 Give a home to a stranger and he will start trouble and estrange you from your own family.

Sir 12:1 If you mean to do a kindness, choose the right person, then your good deeds will not be wasted.

Sir 12:2 Do good to someöne devout, and you will be rewarded, if not by that person, then certainly by the Most
High.

Sir 12:3 No good will come to one who persists in evil, or who refuses to give alms.

Sir 12:4 Give to the devout, do not go to the help of a sinner.

Sir 12:5 Do good to the humble, give nothing to the godless. Refuse him bread, do not give him any, it might
make him stronger than you are; then you would be repaid evil twice over for all the good you had done him.

Sir 1 2:6 For the Most High himself detests sinners, and will repay the wicked with what they deserve.

Sir 12:7 Give to the good, and do not go to the help of a sinner.

Sir 12:8 In prosperity you cannot always tell a true friend, but in adversity you cannot mistake an enemy.

Sir 12:9 When someöne is doing well that person’s enemies are sad, when someöne is doing badly, even a
friend will keep at a distance.

Sir 12:10 Do not ever trust an enemy; as bronze tarnishes, so does an enemy’s malice.

Sir 12:1 1 Even if he behaves humbly and comes bowing and scraping, maintain your reserve and be on your

guard against him. Behave towards him as if you were polishing a mirror, you will find that his tarnish cannot last.
Sir 12:12 Do not stand him beside you in case he thrusts you out and takes your place. Do not seat him on your
right, or he will be after your position, and then you will remember what I have said and sadly admit that I was
right.

Sir 12:13 Who feels sorry for a snake-charmer bitten by a snake, or for those who take risks with savage
animals? -

Sir 12:14 just so for one who consorts with a sinner, and becomes an accomplice in his sins.

Sir 12:15 He will stay with you for a while, but if you once give way he will press his advantage.

Sir 12:16 An enemy may have sweetness on his lips, and in his heart a scheme to throw you into the ditch. An

enemy may have tears in his eyes, but if he gets a chance there can never be too much blood for him.

Sir 12:17 If you meet with misfortune, you will find him there before you, and, pretending to help you, he will trip
you up.

Sir 12:18 He will wag his head and clap his hands, he will whisper a lot and his expression will change.

Sir 13:1 Whoëver touches pitch will be defiled, and anyone who associates with the proud will come to be like



them.

Sir 13:2 Do not try to carry a burden too heavy for you, do not associate with someöne more powerful and
wealthy than yourself. Why put the clay pot next to the iron cauldron? It will only break when they bang against
each other.

Sir 13:3 The rich does wrong and takes a high line; the poor is wronged and has to beg for pardon.

Sir 1 3:4 If you are useful the rich will exploit you, if you go bankrupt he will desert you.

Sir 13:5 Are you well off? - he will live with you, he will clean you out without a single qualm.

Sir 13:6 Does he need you? - he will hoodwink you, smile at you and raise your hopes; he will speak politely to
you and say, “Is there anything you need?”.

Sir 1 3:7 He will make you feel small at his dinner parties and, having cleaned you out two or three times over,
will end by laughing at you. Afterwards, when he sees you, he will avoid you and shake his head about you.

Sir 13:8 Take care you are not hoodwinked and thus humiliated through your own stupidity.

Sir 13:9 When an influential person invites you, show reluctance, and he will press his invitation all the more.

Sir 13:10 Do not thrust yourself forward, in case you are pushed aside, but do not stand aloof, or you will be
overlooked.

Sir 13:1 1 Do not affect to treat him as an equal, do not trust his flow of words; since all this talking is expressly
meant to test you, under cover of geniality he will be weighing you up.

Sir 13:12 Pitiless is anyone who retails gossip; he will not spare you either blows or chains.

Sir 13:13 Be wary, take very great care, because you are walking with your own downfall.

Sir 13:14

Sir 13:15 Every living thing loves its own sort, and every man his fellow.

Sir 13:16 Every creature mixes with its kind, and human beings stick to their own sort.

Sir 13:17 How can wolf and lamb agree? - Just so with sinner and devout.

Sir 13:18 What peace can there be between hyena and dog? And what peace between rich and poor?

Sir 13:19 Wild desert donkeys are the prey of lions; so too, the poor is the quarry of the rich.

Sir 13:20 The proud thinks humility abhorrent; so too, the rich abominates the poor.

Sir 13:21 When the rich stumbles he is supported by friends; when the poor falls, his friends push him away.

Sir 13:22 When the rich slips, there are many hands to catch him, if he talks nonsense he is congratulated. The
poor slips, and is blamed for it, he may talk good sense, but no room is made for him.

Sir 13:23 The rich speaks and everyone stops talking, and then they praise his discourse to the skies. The poor
speaks and people say, “Who is this?”. and if he stumbles, they trip him up yet more.

Sir 13:24 Wealth is good where there is no sin, poverty is evil, the godless say.

Sir 1 3:25 The heart moulds a person’s expression whether for better or worse.

Sir 13:26 Happy heart, cheerful expression; but wearisome work, inventing proverbs.

Sir 14:1 Blessed is anyone who has not sinned in speech and who needs feel no remorse for sins.

Sir 14:2 Blessed is anyone whose conscience brings no reproach and who has never given up hope.

Sir 14:3 Wealth is not the right thing for the niggardly, and what use are possessions to the covetous?

Sir 14:4 Whoëver hoards by stinting himself is hoarding for others, and others will live sumptuously on his
riches.

Sir 14:5 If someöne is mean to himself, whom does he benefit? he does not even enjoy what is his own.

Sir 14:6 No one is meaner than the person who is mean to himself, this is how his wickedness repays him.

Sir 14:7 If he does any good, he does it unintentionally, and in the end he himself reveals his wickedness.

Sir 14:8 Wicked the person who has an envious eye, averting his face, and careless of others’ lives.

Sir 1 4:9 The eye of the grasping is not content with what he has, greed shrivels up the soul.

Sir 14:10 The miser is grudging of bread, there is famine at his table.

Sir 14:1 1 My child, treat yourself as well as you can afford, and bring worthy offerings to the Lord.

Sir 14:12 Remember that death will not delay, and that you have never seen Sheol’s contract.

Sir 14:13 Be kind to your friend before you die, treat him as generously as you can afford.

Sir 14:14 Do not refuse yourself the good things of today, do not let your share of what is lawfully desired pass
you by.

Sir 14:15 Will you not have to leave your fortune to another, and the fruit of your labour to be divided by lot?

Sir 14:16 Give and receive, enjoy yourself — there are no pleasures to be found in Sheol.

Sir 14:17 Like clothes, every body will wear out, the age — old law is, “Everyone must die”.

Sir 14:18 Like foliage growing on a bushy tree, some leaves falling, others growing, so are the generations of
flesh and blood: one dies, another is born.

Sir 14:19 Every achievement rots away and perishes, and with it goes its author.

Sir 14:20 Blessed is anyone who meditates on wisdom, and reasons with intelligence,

Sir 14:21 who studies her ways in his heart, and ponders her secrets.

Sir 14:22 He pursues her like a hunter, and lies in wait by her path;



Sir 14:23 he peeps in at her windows, and listens at her doors;

Sir 14:24 he lodges close to her house, and fixes his peg in her walls;

Sir 14:25 he pitches his tent at her side, and lodges in an excellent lodging;

Sir 14:26 he sets his children in her shade, and camps beneath her branches;

Sir 14:27 he is sheltered by her from the heat, and in her glory he makes his home.

Sir 15:1 Whoëver fears the Lord will act like this, and whoëver grasps the Law will obtain wisdom.

Sir 15:2 She will come to meet him like a mother, and receive him like a virgin bride.

Sir 15:3 She will give him the bread of understanding to eat, and the water of wisdom to drink.

Sir 15:4 He will lean on her and will not fall, he will rely on her and not be put to shame.

Sir 15:5 She will raise him high above his neighbours, and in full assembly she will open his mouth.

Sir 15:6 He will find happiness and a crown of joy, he will inherit an everlasting name.

Sir 1 5:7 Fools will not gain possession of her, nor will sinners set eyes on her.

Sir 1 5:8 She stands remote from pride, and liars cannot call her to mind.

Sir 15:9 Praise is unseemly in a sinner’s mouth, since it has not been put there by the Lord.

Sir 15:10 For praise should be uttered only in wisdom, and the Lord himself then prompts it.

Sir 15:1 1 Do not say, “The Lord was responsible for my sinning”, for he does not do what he hates.

Sir 15:12 Do not say, “It was he who led me astray”, for he has no use for a sinner.

Sir 15:13 The Lord hates all that is foul, and no one who fears him will love it either.

Sir 15:14 He himself made human beings in the beginning, and then left them free to make their own decisions.
Sir 15:15 If you choose, you will keep the commandments and so be faithful to his will.

Sir 15:16 He has set fire and water before you; put out your hand to whichever you prefer.

Sir 15:17 A human being has life and death before him; whichever he prefers will be given him.

Sir 15:18 For vast is the wisdom of the Lord; he is almighty and all-seeing.

Sir 15:19 His eyes are on those who fear him, he notes every human action.

Sir 15:20 He never commanded anyone to be godless, he has given no one permission to sin.

Sir 16:1 Do not long fora brood of worthless children, and do not take pleasure in godless sons.

Sir 1 6:2 However many you have, take no pleasure in them, unless the fear of the Lord lives among them.

Sir 16:3 Do not count on their having long life, do not put too much faith in their number; for better have one
than a thousand, better die childless than have children who are godless.

Sir 1 6:4 One person of sense can populate a city, but a race of lawless people will be destroyed.

Sir 16:5 My eyes have seen many such things, my ears have heard things even more impressive.

Sir 16:6 Fire is kindled in a sinful society, Retribution blazes in a rebellious nation.

Sir 1 6:7 God did not pardon the giants of old who, confident in their strength, had rebelled.

Sir 16:8 He did not spare the people with whom Lot lived; he abhorred them, rather, for their pride.

Sir 16:9 He was pitiless to the nation of perdition — those people who gloried in their sins-

Sir 16:10 as also to the six hundred thousand men on the march, who had banded together in their obstinacy.

Sir 16:1 1 And had there been only one man stubborn, it would have been amazing had he escaped unpunished,
since mercy and wrath alike belong to the Lord who is mighty to forgive and to pour out wrath.

Sir 16:12 As great as his mercy, so is his severity; he judges each person as his deeds deserve:

Sir 16:13 the sinner will not escape with his ill-gotten gains nor the patience of the devout go for nothing.

Sir 16:14 He takes note of every charitable action, and everyone is treated as he deserves.

Sir 16:15
Sir 16:16

Sir 16:17 Do not say, “I shall hide from the Lord; who is going to remember me up there? I shall not be noticed
among so many people; what am I in the immensity of creation?”.

Sir 16:18 For see, the sky and the heavens above the sky, the abyss and the earth shake at his visitation.

Sir 16:19 The mountains and earth’s foundations alike quail and tremble when he looks at them.

Sir 16:20 But to all this no one gives thought. Who keeps his movements in mind?

Sir 16:21 The storm wind itself is invisible, and most of what he does goes undetected.

Sir 16:22 “Who will report whether justice has been done? Who will be watching? The covenant is remote!”.

Sir 1 6:23 Such are the thoughts of the person of little sense, stupid, misguided, cherishing his folly.

Sir 16:24 Listen to me, my child, and learn knowledge, and give your whole mind to my words.

Sir 16:25 I shall expound discipline methodically and proclaim knowledge with precision.

Sir 16:26 When God created his works in the beginning, he assigned them their places as soon as they were
made.

Sir 16:27 He determined his works for all time, from their origins to their distant generations. They know neither
hunger nor weariness, and they never desert their duties.

Sir 1 6:28 Not one has ever got in the way of another, and they will never disobey his word.

Sir 16:29 And afterwards the Lord looked at the earth, and filled it with his good things.



Sir 1 6:30 He covered its surface with every kind of animal, and to it they will return.

Sir 17:1 The Lord fashioned human beings from the earth, to consign them back to it.

Sir 17:2 He gave them so many days and so much time, he gave them authority over everything on earth.

Sir 17:3 He clothed them in strength, like himself, and made them in his own image.

Sir 17:4 He filled all living things with dread of human beings, making them masters over beasts and birds.

Sir 17:5

Sir 17:6 He made them a tongue, eyes and ears, and gave them a heart to think with.

Sir 17:7 He filled them with knowledge and intelligence, and showed them what was good and what evil.

Sir 17:8 He put his own light in their hearts to show them the magnificence of his works,

Sir 17:9

Sir 17:10 so that they would praise his holy name as they told of his magnificent works.

Sir 17:1 1 He set knowledge before them, he endowed them with the law of life.

Sir 17:12 He established an eternal covenant with them, and revealed his judgements to them.

Sir 17:13 Their eyes saw the majesty of his glory, and their ears heard the glory of his voice.

Sir 17:14 He said to them, “Beware of all wrong-doing”; he gave each a commandment concerning his
neighbour.

Sir 17:15 Their ways are always under his eye, they cannot be hidden from his sight.

Sir 17:16

Sir 17:17 Over each nation he has set a governor, but Israel is the Lord’s own portion.

Sir 17:18

Sir 17:19 Their actions are all as plain as the sun to him, and his eyes rest constantly on their conduct.

Sir 17:20 Their iniquities are not hidden from him, all their sins are before the Lord.

Sir 17:21

Sir 17:22 Almsgiving is like a signet ring to him, he cherishes generosity like the pupil of an eye.

Sir 17:23 One day he will rise and reward them, he will repay their deserts on their own heads.

Sir 17:24 But to those who repent he permits return, and he encourages those who have lost hope.

Sir 17:25 Return to the Lord and renounce your sins, plead before his face, stop offending him.

Sir 17:26 Come back to the Most High, turn away from iniquity and hold all that is foul in abhorrence.

Sir 17:27 Who is going to praise the Most High in Sheol if we do not glorify him while we are alive?

Sir 17:28 The dead can praise no more than those who do not exist, only those with life and health can praise
the Lord.

Sir 17:29 How great is the mercy of the Lord, his pardon for those who turn to him!

Sir 17:30 For we cannot have everything, human beings are not immortal.

Sir 17:31 What is brighter than the sun? And yet it fades. Flesh and blood think of nothing but evil.

Sir 17:32 He surveys the armies of the lofty sky, and all of us are only dust and ashes.

Sir 18:1 He who lives for ever has created the sum of things.

Sir 18:2 The Lord alone will be found just.

Sir 18:3

Sir 18:4 He has given no one the power to proclaim his works to the end, and who can fathom his magnificent
deeds?

Sir 18:5 Who can assess his magnificent strength, and who can go further and tell all of his mercies?

Sir 18:6 Nothing can be added to them, nothing subtracted, it is impossible to fathom the marvels of the Lord.

Sir 18:7 When someöne finishes he is only beginning, and when he stops he is as puzzled as ever.

Sir 18:8 What is a human being, what purpose does he serve? What is good and what is bad for him?

Sir 18:9 The length of his life: a hundred years at most.

Sir 18:10 Like a drop of water from the sea, or a grain of sand, such are these few years compared with eternity.
Sir 18:1 1 This is why the Lord is patient with them and pours out his mercy on them.

Sir 18:12 He sees and recognises how wretched their end is, and so he makes his forgiveness the greater.

Sir 18:13 Human compassion extends to neighbours, but the Lord’s compassion extends to everyone; rebuking,
correcting and teaching, bringing them back as a shepherd brings his flock.

Sir 18:14 He has compassion on those who accept correction, and who fervently search for his judgements.

Sir 18:15 My child, do not temper your favours with blame nor any of your gifts with words that hurt.

Sir 18:16 Does not dew relieve the heat? In the same way a word is worth more than a gift.

Sir 18:17 Why surely, a word is better than a good present, but a generous person is ready with both.

Sir 18:18 A fool will offer nothing but insult, and a grudging gift makes the eyes smart.

Sir 18:19 Learn before you speak, take care of yourself before you fall ill.

Sir 1 8:20 Examine yourself before judgement comes, and on the day of visitation you will be acquitted.

Sir 18:21 Humble yourself before you fall ill, repent as soon as the sin is committed.

Sir 18:22 Let nothing prevent your discharging a vow in good time, and do not wait until death to set matters right.



Sir 18:23 Prepare yourself before making a vow, and do not be like someöne who tempts the Lord.

Sir 18:24 Bear in mind the retribution of the last days, the time of vengeance when God averts his face.

Sir 1 8:25 In a time of plenty remember times of famine, think of poverty and want when you are rich.

Sir 1 8:26 The time slips by between dawn and dusk, everything passes quickly for the Lord.

Sir 18:27 The wise will be cautious in everything, in sinful times will take care not to offend.

Sir 18:28 Every person of sense recognises wisdom, and will respect anyone who has found her.

Sir 18:29 Those who understand sayings have toiled for their wisdom and have poured out accurate maxims.

Sir 18:30 Do not be governed by your passions, restrain your desires.

Sir 1 8:31 If you allow yourself to satisfy your desires, this will make you the laughing-stock of your enemies.

Sir 18:32 Do not indulge in luxurious living, do not get involved in such society.

Sir 18:33 Do not beggar yourself by banqueting on credit when there is nothing in your pocket.

Sir 19:1 A drunken workman will never grow rich, and one who makes light of small matters will gradually sink.
Sir 19:2 Wine and women corrupt intelligent men, the customer of whores loses all sense of shame.

Sir 19:3 Grubs and worms will have him as their legacy, and the man who knows no shame will lose his life.

Sir 19:4 Being too ready to trust shows shallowness of mind, and sinning harms the sinner.

Sir 19:5 Taking pleasure in evil earns condemnation;

Sir 19:6 by hating gossip one avoids evil.

Sir 19:7 Never repeat what you are told and you will come to no harm;

Sir 1 9:8 whether to friend or foe, do not talk about it, unless it would be sinful not to, do not reveal it;

Sir 19:9 you would be heard out, then mistrusted, and in due course you would be hated.

Sir 19:10 Have you heard something? Let it die with you. Courage! It will not burst you!

Sir 19:1 1 A fool will suffer birthpangs over a piece of news, like a woman labouring with child.

Sir 19:12 Like an arrow stuck in the flesh of the thigh, so is a piece of news inside a fool.

Sir 19:13 Question your friend, he may have done nothing at all; and if he has done anything, he will not do it
again.

Sir 19:14 Question your neighbour, he may have said nothing at all; and if he has said anything, he will not say
it again.

Sir 19:15 Question your friend, for slander is very common, do not believe all you hear.

Sir 19:16 People sometimes make a slip, without meaning what they say; and which of us has never sinned by
speech?

Sir 19:17 Question your neighbour before you threaten him, and defer to the Law of the Most High.

Sir 19:18
Sir 19:19

Sir 19:20 Wisdom consists entirely in fearing the Lord, and wisdom is entirely constituted by the fulfilling of the
Law.

Sir 19:21

Sir 19:22 Being learned in evil, however, is not wisdom, there is no prudence in the advice of sinners.

Sir 19:23 There is a cleverness that is detestable; whoëver has no wisdom is a fool.

Sir 1 9:24 Better be short of sense and full of fear, than abound in shrewdness and violate the Law.

Sir 19:25 There is a wickedness which is scrupulous but nonetheless dishonest, and there are those who
misuse kindness to win their case.

Sir 19:26 There is the person who will walk bowed down with grief, when inwardly this is nothing but deceit:

Sir 19:27 he hides his face and pretends to be deaf, if he is not unmasked, he will take advantage of you.

Sir 19:28 There is the person who is prevented from sinning by lack of strength, yet he will do wrong when he
gets the chance.

Sir 19:29 You can tell a person by his appearance, you can tell a thinker by the look on his face.

Sir 19:30 The way a person dresses, the way he laughs, the way he walks, tell you what he is.

Sir 20:1 There is the rebuke that is untimely, and there is the person who keeps quiet, and he is the shrewd one.
Sir 20:2 But how much better to rebuke than to fume!

Sir 20:3 The person who acknowledges a fault wards off punishment.

Sir 20:4 Like a eunuch trying to take a girl’s virginity is someöne who tries to impose justice by force.

Sir 20:5 There is the person who keeps quiet and is considered wise, another incurs hatred for talking too much.
Sir 20:6 There is the person who keeps quiet, not knowing how to answer, another keeps quiet, knowing when
to speak.

Sir 20:7 The wise will keep quiet until the right moment, but a garrulous fool will always misjudge it.

Sir 20:8 Someöne who talks too much will earn dislike, and someöne who usurps authority will earn hatred.

Sir 20:9 There is the person who finds misfortune a boon, and the piece of luck that turns to loss.

Sir 20:10 There is the gift that affords you no profit, and the gift that repays you double.

Sir 20:1 1 There is the honour that leads to humiliation, and there are people in a low state who raise their



heads.

Sir 20:12 There is the person who buys much for little, yet pays for it seven times over.

Sir 20:13 The wise wins love with words, while fools may shower favours in vain.

Sir 20:14 The gift of the stupid will bring you no advantage, his eyes look for seven times as much in return.

Sir 20:15 He gives little and reviles much, he opens his mouth like the town crier, he lends today and demands
payment tomorrow; he is a detestable fellow.

Sir 20:16 The fool will say, “I have no friends, I get no gratitude for my good deeds;

Sir 20:17 those who eat my bread have malicious tongues”. How often he will be laughed at, and by how many!
Sir 20:18 Better a slip on the pavement than a slip of the tongue; this is how ruin takes the wicked by surprise.
Sir 20:19 A coarse-grained person is like an indiscreet story endlessly retold by the ignorant.

Sir 20:20 A maxim is rejected when coming from a fool, since the fool does not utter it on the apt occasion.

Sir 20:21 There is a person who is prevented from sinning by poverty; no qualms of conscience disturb that
person’s rest.

Sir 20:22 There is a person who courts destruction out of false shame, courts destruction for the sake of a fool’s
opinion.

Sir 20:23 There is a person who out of false shame makes promises to a friend, and so makes an enemy for
nothing.

Sir 20:24 Lying is an ugly blot on anyone, and ever on the lips of the undisciplined.

Sir 20:25 A thief is preferable to an inveterate liar, but both are heading for ruin.

Sir 20:26 Lying is an abominable habit, the liar’s disgrace lasts for ever.

Sir 20:27 The wise gains advancement by words, the shrewd wins favour from the great.

Sir 20:28 Whoëver tills the soil will have a full harvest, whoëver wins favour from the great will secure pardon for
offences.

Sir 20:29 Presents and gifts blind the eyes of the wise and stifle rebukes like a muzzle on the mouth.

Sir 20:30 Wisdom concealed, and treasure undiscovered, what use is either of these?

Sir 20:31 Better one who conceals his folly than one who conceals his wisdom.

Sir 21:1 My child, have you sinned? Do so no more, and ask forgiveness for your previous faults.

Sir 21 :2 Flee from sin as from a snake, if you approach it, it will bite you; its teeth are lion’s teeth, they take
human life away.

Sir 21 :3 All law-breaking is like a two-edged sword, the wounds it inflicts are beyond cure.

Sir 21 :4 Terror and violence make havoc of riches, similarly, desolation overtakes the houses of the proud.

Sir 21 :5 A plea from the mouth of the poor goes straight to the ear of God, whose judgement comes without
delay.

Sir 21 :6 Whoëver resents reproof walks in the sinner’s footsteps; whoëver fears the Lord is repentant of heart.
Sir 21 :7 The glib speaker is known far and wide, but the wary detects every slip.

Sir 21 :8 To build your house with other people’s money is like collecting stones for your own tomb.

Sir 21 :9 A meeting of the lawless is like a heap of tow: they will end in a blazing fire.

Sir 21:10 The sinner’s road is smoothly paved, but it ends at the pit of Sheol.

Sir 21:11 Whoëver keeps the Law will master his instincts; the fear of the Lord is made perfect in wisdom.

Sir 21:12 No one who lacks aptitude can be taught, but certain aptitudes give rise to bitterness.

Sir 21:1 3 The sage’s knowledge is as rich as the abyss and his advice is like a living spring.

Sir 21:14 The heart of a fool is like a broken jar, it will not hold any knowledge.

Sir 21:1 5 If the educated hears a wise saying, he praises it and caps it with another; if a debauchee hears it, he
does not like it and tosses it behind his back.

Sir 21:16 The talk of a fool is like a load on a journey, but it is a pleasure to listen to the intelligent.

Sir 21:1 7 The utterance of the shrewd will be eagerly awaited in the assembly, what he says will be given
serious consideration.

Sir 21:18 The wisdom of a fool is like the wreckage of a house, the knowledge of a dolt is incoherent talk.

Sir 21:19 To the senseless fellow instruction is like fetters on the feet, like manacles on the right hand.

Sir 21 :20 A fool laughs at the top of his voice, but the intelligent quietly smiles.

Sir 21 :21 To the shrewd instruction is like a golden ornament, like a bracelet on the right arm.

Sir 21 :22 The step of a fool goes straight into a house, but a person of much experience makes a respectful
approach;

Sir 21 :23 the stupid peeps inside through the door, a well-bred person waits outside.

Sir 21 :24 Listening at doors is a sign of bad upbringing, the perceptive would be ashamed to do so.

Sir 21 :25 The lips of gossips repeat the words of others, the words of the wise are carefully weighed.

Sir 21 :26 The heart of fools is in their mouth, but the mouth of the wise is in their heart.

Sir 21 :27 When the godless curses Satan, he is cursing himself.

Sir 21 :28 The scandal-monger sullies himself and earns the hatred of the neighbourhood.



Sir 22:1 An idler is like a stone covered in filth, everyone whistles at his disgrace.

Sir 22:2 An idler is like a lump of dung, anyone picking it up shakes it off his hand.

Sir 22:3 It is a disgrace to have fathered a badly brought-up son, but the birth of any daughter is a loss;

Sir 22:4 a sensible daughter will find a husband, but a shameless one is a grief to her father.

Sir 22:5 A brazen daughter puts father and mother to shame, and will be disowned by both.

Sir 22:6 An untimely remonstrance is like music at a funeral, but a thrashing and correction are wisdom at all
times.

Sir 22:7
Sir 22:8

Sir 22:9 Teaching a fool is like gluing bits of pottery together — you are rousing someöne who is besotted with
sleep.

Sir 22:10 You might as well talk to someöne sound asleep; when you have finished the fool will say, “What’s
up?”.

Sir 22:1 1 Shed tears for the dead, who has left the light behind; shed tears for the fool, who has left his wits
behind. Shed quieter tears for the dead who is at rest, for the fool life is worse than death.

Sir 22:12 Mourning for the dead lasts seven days, for the foolish and ungodly all the days of their lives.

Sir 22:13 Do not waste many words on the stupid, do not go near a dolt. Beware of him, or you will have trouble
and be soiled by contact with him; keep away from him, and you will have peace of mind and not be exasperated
by his folly.

Sir 22:14 What is heavier than lead, and what is its name if not “fool'?

Sir 22:15 Sand and salt and a lump of iron are a lighter burden than a dolt.

Sir 22:16 A tie-beam bonded into a building will not be dislodged by an earthquake; so too, a heart resolved
after due reflection will not flinch at the critical moment.

Sir 22:17 A heart founded on intelligent reflection is like a stucco decoration on a smooth wall.

Sir 22:18 Pebbles placed on top of a wall will not stand up to the wind; no more can the heart of a fool frightened

at his own thoughts stand up to fear.

Sir 22:19 Prick an eye and you will draw a tear, prick a heart and you reveal its feelings.

Sir 22:20 Throw stones at birds and you scare them away, reproach a friend and you destroy a friendship.

Sir 22:21 If you have drawn your sword on a friend, do not despair; there is a way back.

Sir 22:22 If you have opened your mouth against your friend, do not worry; there is hope for reconciliation; but
insult, arrogance, betrayal of secrets, and the stab in the back — in these cases any friend is lost.

Sir 22:23 Win your neighbour’s confidence when he is poor, so that you may enjoy his later good fortune with
him; stand by him in times of trouble, in order to have your share when he comes into a legacy.

Sir 22:24 Fire is heralded by the reek of the furnace and smoke, so too, bloodshed by insults.

Sir 22:25 I shall not be ashamed to shelter a friend nor shall I hide away from him,

Sir 22:26 and if evil comes to me through him, everyone who hears about it will beware of him.

Sir 22:27 Who will set a guard on my mouth, and an efficient seal on my lips, to keep me from falling, and my
tongue from causing my ruin?

Sir 23:1 Lord, father and master of my life, do not abandon me to their whims, do not let me fall because of
them.

Sir 23:2 Who will lay whips to my thoughts, and the discipline of wisdom to my heart, to be merciless to my
errors and not let my sins go unchecked,

Sir 23:3 for fear my errors should multiply and my sins then abound and I fall before my adversaries, and my
enemy gloat over me?

Sir 23:4 Lord, father and God of my life, do not let my eyes be proud,

Sir 23:5 turn envy away from me,

Sir 23:6 do not let lechery and lust grip me, do not leave me a prey to shameless desire.

Sir 23:7 Children, listen to what I teach, no one who keeps it will be caught out.

Sir 23:8 The sinner is ensnared by his own lips, both the abusive and the proud are tripped by them.

Sir 23:9 Do not get into the habit of swearing, do not make a habit of naming the Holy One;

Sir 23:10 for just as a slave who is constantly overseen will never be without bruises, so someöne who is always
swearing and uttering the Name will not be exempt from sin.

Sir 23:1 1 A man for ever swearing is full of iniquity, and the scourge will not depart from his house. If he offends,
his sin will be on him, if he did it unheedingly, he has doubly sinned; if he swears a false oath, he will not be
treated as innocent, for his house will be filled with calamities.

Sir 23:12 One way of talking is like death, let it not be found in the heritage of Jacob since devout people have
nothing to do with that: they will not wallow in sin.

Sir 23:13 Do not get into the habit of using coarse and foul language since this involves sinful words.

Sir 23:14 Remember your father and mother when you are sitting with the great, for fear you forget yourself in



their presence and behave like a fool, and then wish you had not been born and curse the day of your birth.

Sir 23:15 No one in the habit of using shameful language will break himself of it as long as he lives.

Sir 23:16 There are two types of people who commit sin after sin and a third who attracts retribution-
Sir 23:17 desire, blazing like a furnace, will not die down until it has been sated- the man who lusts after
members of his own family is not going to stop until he is quite burnt out; every food is sweet to the promiscuous,
and he will not desist until he dies;

Sir 23:18 and the man who sins against the marriage bed and says to himself, “Who can see me? There is
darkness all round me, the walls hide me, no one can see me, why should I worry? The Most High will not
remember my sins”.

Sir 23:19 What he fears are human eyes, he does not realise that the eyes of the Lord are ten thousand times
brighter than the sun, observing every aspect of human behaviour, seeing into the most secret corners.

Sir 23:20 All things were known to him before they were created, and are still, now that they are finished.

Sir 23:21 This man will be punished in view of the whole town, and will be seized when he least expects it.

Sir 23:22 Similarly the woman unfaithful to her husband, who provides him with an heir by another man:

Sir 23:23 first, she has disobeyed the Law of the Most High; secondly, she has been false to her husband; and
thirdly, she has gone whoring in adultery

Sir 23:24 and conceived children by another man. She will be led before the assembly, an enquiry will be held
about her children.

Sir 23:25 Her children will strike no root, her branches will bear no fruit.

Sir 23:26 She will leave an accursed memory behind her, her shame will never be wiped out.

Sir 23:27 And those who survive her will recognise that nothing is better than fearing the Lord, and nothing
sweeter than adherence to the Lord’s commandments.

Sir 24:1 Wisdom speaks her own praises, in the midst of her people she glories in herself.

Sir 24:2 She opens her mouth in the assembly of the Most High, she glories in herself in the presence of the
Mighty One:

Sir 24:3 “I came forth from the mouth of the Most High, and I covered the earth like mist.

Sir 24:4 I had my tent in the heights, and my throne was a pillar of cloud.

Sir 24:5 Alone, I have made the circuit of the heavens and walked through the depths of the abyss.

Sir 24:6 Over the waves of the sea and over the whole earth, and over every people and nation I have held
sway.

Sir 24:7 Among all these I searched for rest, and looked to see in whose territory I might pitch camp.

Sir 24:8 Then the Creator of all things instructed me and he who created me fixed a place for my tent. He said,
‘Pitch your tent in Jacob, make Israel your inheritance’.

Sir 24:9 From eternity, in the beginning, he created me, and for eternity I shall remain.

Sir 24:10 In the holy tent I ministered before him and thus became established in Zion.

Sir 24:1 1 In the beloved city he has given me rest, and in Jerusalem I wield my authority.

Sir 24:12 I have taken root in a privileged people, in the Lord’s property, in his inheritance.

Sir 24:13 I have grown tall as a cedar on Lebanon, as a cypress on Mount Hermon;

Sir 24:14 I have grown tall as a palm in En-Gedi, as the rose bushes of Jericho; as a fine olive in the plain, as a
plane tree, I have grown tall.

Sir 24:15 Like cinnamon and acanthus, I have yielded a perfume, like choice myrrh, have breathed out a scent,
like galbanum, onycha, labdanum, like the smoke of incense in the tent.

Sir 24:16 I have spread my branches like a terebinth, and my branches are glorious and graceful.

Sir 24:17 I am like a vine putting out graceful shoots, my blossoms bear the fruit of glory and wealth.

Sir 24:18

Sir 24:19 Approach me, you who desire me, and take your fill of my fruits,

Sir 24:20 for memories of me are sweeter than honey, inheriting me is sweeter than the honeycomb.

Sir 24:21 They who eat me will hunger for more, they who drink me will thirst for more.

Sir 24:22 No one who obeys me will ever have to blush, no one who acts as I dictate will ever sin”.

Sir 24:23 All this is no other than the Book of the Covenant of the Most High God, the Law that Moses enjoined
on us, an inheritance for the communities of Jacob.

Sir 24:24

Sir 24:25 This is what makes wisdom brim over like the Pishon, like the Tigris in the season of fruit,

Sir 24:26 what makes intelligence overflow like the Euphrates, like the Jordan at harvest time;

Sir 24:27 and makes discipline flow like the Nile, like the Gihon when the grapes are harvested.

Sir 24:28 The first man did not finish discovering about her, nor has the most recent tracked her down;

Sir 24:29 for her thoughts are wider than the sea, and her designs more profound than the abyss.

Sir 24:30 And I, like a conduit from a river, like a watercourse running into a garden,

Sir 24:31 I said, “I am going to water my orchard, I intend to irrigate my flower beds”. And see, my conduit has



grown into a river, and my river has grown into a sea.

Sir 24:32 Making discipline shine forth from daybreak, I shall send its light far and wide.

Sir 24:33 I shall pour out teaching like prophecy, as a legacy to all future generations.

Sir 24:34 And note, I have been working not merely for myself, but for all who are seeking wisdom.

Sir 25:1 There are three things my soul delights in, and which are delightful to God and to all people: concord
between brothers, friendship between neighbours, and a wife and husband who live happily together.

Sir 25:2 There are three sorts of people my soul hates, and whose existence I consider an outrage: the poor
swollen with pride, the rich who is a liar and an adulterous old man who has no sense.

Sir 25:3 If you have gathered nothing in your youth, how can you discover anything in your old age?

Sir 25:4 How fine a thing: sound judgement with grey hairs, and for greybeards to know how to advise!

Sir 25:5 How fine a thing: wisdom in the aged, and considered advice coming from people of distinction!

Sir 25:6 The crown of the aged is ripe experience, their glory, the fear of the Lord.

Sir 25:7 There are nine things I can think of which strike me as happy, and a tenth which is now on my tongue:
the man who can be proud of his children, he who lives to see the downfall of his enemies;

Sir 25:8 happy is he who keeps house with a sensible wife; he who does not toil with ox and donkey; he who
has never sinned with his tongue; he who does not serve a man less worthy than himself;

Sir 25:9 happy is he who has acquired good sense and can find attentive ears for what he has to say;

Sir 25:10 how great is he who has acquired wisdom; but unsurpassed is one who fears the Lord.

Sir 25:1 1 The fear of the Lord surpasses everything; what can compare with someöne who has mastered that?
Sir 25:12

Sir 25:13 Any wound rather than a wound of the heart! Any spite rather than the spite of woman!

Sir 25:14 Any evil rather than an evil caused by an enemy! Any vengeance rather than the vengeance of a foe!
Sir 25:15 There is no poison worse than the poison of a snake, there is no fury worse than the fury of an enemy.
Sir 25:16 I would sooner keep house with a lion or a dragon than keep house with a spiteful wife.

Sir 25:17 A woman’s spite changes her appearance and makes her face as grim as a bear’s.

Sir 25:18 When her husband goes out to dinner with his neighbours, he cannot help heaving bitter sighs.

Sir 25:19 No spite can approach the spite of a woman, may a sinner’s lot be hers!

Sir 25:20 Like the climbing of a sandhill for elderly feet, such is a garrulous wife for a quiet husband.

Sir 25:21 Do not be taken in by a woman’s beauty, never lose your head over a woman.

Sir 25:22 Bad temper, insolence and shame hold sway where the wife supports the husband.

Sir 25:23 Low spirits, gloomy face, stricken heart: such is a spiteful wife. Slack hands and sagging knees: such
is the wife who does not make her husband happy.

Sir 25:24 Sin began with a woman, and thanks to her we must all die.

Sir 25:25 Do not let water find a leak, nor a spiteful woman give free rein to her tongue.

Sir 25:26 If she will not do as you tell her, get rid of her.

Sir 26:1 How blessed is the husband of a really good wife; the number of his days will be doubled.

Sir 26:2 A perfect wife is the joy of her husband, he will live out the years of his life in peace.

Sir 26:3 A good wife is the best of portions, reserved for those who fear the Lord;

Sir 26:4 rich or poor, their hearts will be glad, their faces cheerful, whatever the season.

Sir 26:5 There are three things that I dread, and a fourth which terrifies me: slander by a whole town, the
gathering of a mob, and a false accusation — these are all worse than death;

Sir 26:6 but a woman jealous of a woman means heartbreak and sorrow, and all this is the scourge of the
tongue.

Sir 26:7 A bad wife is a badly fitting ox-yoke, trying to master her is like grasping a scorpion.

Sir 26:8 A drunken wife will goad anyone to fury, she cannot conceal her own degradation.

Sir 26:9 A woman’s wantonness shows in her wide-eyed look, her eyelashes leave no doubt.

Sir 26:10 Keep a headstrong daughter under firm control, or, feeling free, she will take advantage of it.

Sir 26:1 1 Keep a strict watch on her shameless eye, do not be surprised if she disgraces you.

Sir 26:12 Like a thirsty traveller she will open her mouth and drink any water she comes across; she will sit
down in front of every tent-peg and open her quiver to any arrow.

Sir 26:13 The grace of a wife will charm her husband, her understanding will make him the stronger.

Sir 26:14 A silent wife is a gift from the Lord, no price can be put on a well-trained character.

Sir 26:15 A modest wife is a boon twice over, a chaste character cannot be over-valued.

Sir 26:16 Like the sun rising over the mountains of the Lord, such is the beauty of a good wife in a well-run
house.

Sir 26:17 Like a lamp shining on the sacred lamp-stand, such is a beautiful face on a well-proportioned body.

Sir 26:18 Like golden pillars on a silver base, such are shapely legs on firm-set heels.

Sir 26:19
Sir 26:20



Sir 26:21
Sir 26:22
Sir 26:23
Sir 26:24
Sir 26:25
Sir 26:26
Sir 26:27

Sir 26:28 There are two things which grieve my heart and a third arouses my anger: a warrior wasting away
through poverty, the intelligent treated with contempt, someöne turning back from virtue to sin — the Lord marks
out such a person for a violent death.

Sir 26:29 It is difficult for a merchant to avoid doing wrong and for a trader not to incur sin.

Sir 27:1 Many have sinned for the sake of profit, one who hopes to be rich must turn a blind eye.

Sir 27:2 A peg will stick in the joint between two stones, and sin will wedge itself between selling and buying.

Sir 27:3 Whoëver does not firmly hold to the fear of the Lord, his house will soon be overthrown.

Sir 27:4 In a shaken sieve the rubbish is left behind, so too the defects of a person appear in speech.

Sir 27:5 The kiln tests the work of the potter, the test of a person is in conversation.

Sir 27:6 The orchard where the tree grows is judged by its fruit, similarly words betray what a person feels.

Sir 27:7 Do not praise anyone who has not yet spoken, since this is where people are tested.

Sir 27:8 If you pursue virtue, you will attain it and put it on like a festal gown.

Sir 27:9 Birds consort with their kind, truth comes home to those who practise it.

Sir 27:10 The lion lies in wait for its prey, so does sin for those who do wrong.

Sir 27:1 1 The conversation of the devout is wisdom at all times, but the fool is as changeable as the moon.

Sir 27:12 When visiting stupid people, choose the right moment, but among the thoughtful take your time.

Sir 27:13 The conversation of fools is disgusting, raucous their laughter in their sinful pleasures.

Sir 27:14 The talk of hard-swearing people makes your hair stand on end, their brawling makes you stop your
ears.

Sir 27:15 A quarrel between the proud leads to bloodshed, and their insults are embarrassing to hear.

Sir 27:16 A betrayer of secrets forfeits all trust and will never find the kind of friend he wants.

Sir 27:17 Be fond of a friend and keep faith with him, but if you have betrayed his secrets, do not go after him
any more;

Sir 27:18 for, as one destroys a person by killing him, so you have killed your neighbour’s friendship,

Sir 27:19 and as you let a bird slip through your fingers, so you have let your friend go, and will not catch him.

Sir 27:20 Do not go after him - he is far away, he has fled like a gazelle from the snare.

Sir 27:21 For a wound can be bandaged and abuse forgiven, but for the betrayer of a secret there is no hope.

Sir 27:22 Someöne with a sly wink is plotting mischief, no one can dissuade him from it.

Sir 27:23 Honey-tongued to your face, he is lost in admiration at your words; but behind your back he has other
things to say, and turns your words into a stumbling-block.

Sir 27:24 I have found many things to hate, but nothing as much as him, and the Lord hates him too.

Sir 27:25 Whoëver throws a stone in the air, throws it on to his own head; a treacherous blow cuts both ways.

Sir 27:26 The man who digs a pit falls into it, whoëver sets a snare will be caught by it.

Sir 27:27 On anyone who does evil, evil will recoil, without his knowing where it comes from.

Sir 27:28 Sarcasm and abuse are the mark of the arrogant, but vengeance lies in wait like a lion for such a one.
Sir 27:29 The trap will close on all who rejoice in the downfall of the devout, and pain will eat them up before
they die.

Sir 27:30 Resentment and anger, these are foul things too, and a sinner is a master at them both.

Sir 28:1 Whoëver exacts vengeance will experience the vengeance of the Lord, who keeps strict account of sin.
Sir 28:2 Pardon your neighbour any wrongs done to you, and when you pray, your sins will be forgiven.

Sir 28:3 If anyone nurses anger against another, can one then demand compassion from the Lord?

Sir 28:4 Showing no pity for someöne like oneself, can one then plead for one’s own sins?

Sir 28:5 Mere creature of flesh, yet cherishing resentment!-who will forgive one for sinning?

Sir 28:6 Remember the last things, and stop hating, corruption and death, and be faithful to the commandments.
Sir 28:7 Remember the commandments, and do not bear your fellow ill-will, remember the covenant of the Most
High, and ignore the offence.

Sir 28:8 Avoid quarrelling and you will sin less; for the hot-tempered provokes quarrels,

Sir 28:9 a sinner sows trouble between friends, introducing discord among the peaceful.

Sir 28:10 The way a fire burns depends on its fuel, a quarrel spreads in proportion to its violence; a man’s rage
depends on his strength, his fury grows fiercer in proportion to his wealth.

Sir 28:1 1 A sudden quarrel kindles fire, a hasty dispute leads to bloodshed.

Sir 28:12 Blow on a spark and up it flares, spit on it and out it goes; both are the effects of your mouth.



Sir 28:13 A curse on the scandal-monger and double-talker, such a person has ruined many who lived in
concord.

Sir 28:14 That third tongue has shattered the peace of many and driven them from nation to nation; it has pulled
down fortified cities, and overthrown the houses of the great.

Sir 28:15 The third tongue has had upright wives divorced, depriving them of reward for their hard work.

Sir 28:16 No one who listens to it will ever know peace of mind, will ever live in peace again.

Sir 28:17 A stroke of the whip raises a weal, but a stroke of the tongue breaks bones.

Sir 28:18 Many have fallen by the edge of the sword, but many more have fallen by the tongue.

Sir 28:19 Blessed is anyone who has been sheltered from it, and has not experienced its fury, who has not
dragged its yoke about, or been bound in its chains;

Sir 28:20 for its yoke is an iron yoke, its chains are bronze chains;

Sir 28:21 the death it inflicts is a miserable death, Sheol is preferable to it.

Sir 28:22 It cannot gain a hold over the devout, they are not burnt by its flames.

Sir 28:23 Those who desert the Lord will fall into it, it will flare up inextinguishably among them, it will be let
loose against them like a lion, it will tear them like a leopard.

Sir 28:24 Be sure you put a thorn-hedge round your property, lock away your silver and gold;

Sir 28:25 then make scales and weights for your words, and put a door with bolts across your mouth.

Sir 28:26 Take care you take no false step through it, in case you fall a prey to him who lies in wait.

Sir 29:1 Making your neighbour a loan is an act of mercy, to lend him a helping hand is to keep the
commandments.

Sir 29:2 Lend to your neighbour in his time of need, and in your turn repay your neighbour on time.

Sir 29:3 Be as good as your word and keep faith with him, and you will find your needs met every time.

Sir 29:4 Many treat a loan as a windfall, and embarrass those who have come to their rescue.

Sir 29:5 Until he gets something, a man will kiss his neighbour’s hand, and refer diffidently to his wealth; but
when the loan falls due, he puts this off, he repays with offhand words, and pleads the inconvenience of the time.
Sir 29:6 Even if he can be made to pay, his creditor will recover barely half, and consider even that a windfall.
But otherwise he will be cheated of his money, and undeservedly gain himself an enemy; the man will pay him
back in curses and abuse, and with insults instead of honour.

Sir 29:7 Many, not out of malice, refuse to lend; they are merely anxious not to be cheated for nothing.

Sir 29:8 Nevertheless, be patient with those who are badly off, do not keep them waiting on your generosity.

Sir 29:9 In obedience to the commandment, help the poor; do not turn the poor away empty-handed in their
need.

Sir 29:10 Spend your money on your brother or your friend, do not leave it under a stone to rust away.

Sir 29:1 1 Use your wealth as the Most High has decreed; you will find that more profitable than gold.

Sir 29:12 Stock your store-rooms with almsgiving; this will save you from all misfortune.

Sir 29:13 Better than sturdy shield or weighty spear, this will fight for you against the enemy.

Sir 29:14 A good man will go surety for his neighbour; only a shameless wretch would desert him.

Sir 29:15 Do not forget the favour your guarantor has done you; he has given his life for you.

Sir 29:16 A sinner is careless of his guarantor’s prosperity, the ungrateful forgets his deliverer.

Sir 29:17 Going surety has ruined many who were prosperous, tossing them about in a heavy sea.

Sir 29:18 It has driven the powerful from home to wander among foreign nations.

Sir 29:19 A wicked man in a hurry to stand guarantor in the hope of profit, is hurrying to be sentenced.

Sir 29:20 Come to your neighbour’s help as far as you can, but take care not to fall into the same plight.

Sir 29:21 The first thing in life is water, and bread, and clothing, and a house for the sake of privacy.

Sir 29:22 Better the life of the poor under a roof of planks, than lavish fare in somebody else’s house.

Sir 29:23 Whether you have little or much, be content with it, and you will not hear your household complaining.
Sir 29:24 It is a miserable life, going from house to house; wherever you stay, you dare not open your mouth,

Sir 29:25 you do not belong, you receive no thanks for the drink you pour out and hear embittering words into
the bargain:

Sir 29:26 “Come along, stranger, lay the table, what have you got ready? give me something to eat!”.

Sir 29:27 “Go away, stranger, make room for someöne important; my brother is coming to stay, I need the
house”.

Sir 29:28 It is hard for the reasonable to be begrudged hospitality to be shamed like a debtor.

Sir 30:1 Whoëver loves his son will beat him frequently so that in after years the son may be his comfort.

Sir 30:2 Whoëver is strict with his son will reap the benefit, and be able to boast of him to his acquaintances.

Sir 30:3 Whoëver educates his son will be the envy of his enemy, and will be proud of him among his friends.

Sir 30:4 Even when the father dies, he might well not be dead, since he leaves his likeness behind him.

Sir 30:5 In life he has had the joy of his company, dying, he has no anxieties.

Sir 30:6 He leaves an avenger against his enemies and a rewarder of favours for his friends.



Sir 30:7 Whoëver coddles his son will bandage his wounds, his heart will turn over at every cry.

Sir 30:8 A badly broken-in horse turns out stubborn, a son left to himself turns out headstrong.

Sir 30:9 Pamper your child and he will terrorise you, play along with him and he will bring you sorrow.

Sir 30:10 Do not laugh with him, or one day you will weep with him and end up gnashing your teeth.

Sir 30:1 1 While he is young, do not allow him his freedom and do not wink at his mistakes.

Sir 30:12 Bend his neck in youth, bruise his ribs while he is a child, or else he will grow stubborn and
disobedient, and hurt you very deeply.

Sir 30:13 Be strict with your son, and persevere with him, or you will rue his insolence.

Sir 30:14 Better be poor if healthy and fit than rich if tormented in body.

Sir 30:15 Health and strength are better than any gold, a robust body than untold wealth.

Sir 30:16 No riches can outweigh bodily health, no enjoyment surpass a cheerful heart.

Sir 30:17 Better death than a wretched life, and everlasting rest than chronic illness.

Sir 30:18 Good things lavished on a closed mouth are like food offerings put on a grave.

Sir 30:19 What use is an offering to an idol which can neither eat nor smell? How describe someöne pursued by
the Lord’s displeasure?

Sir 30:20 He looks and sighs like a eunuch embracing a pretty girl — how he sighs!

Sir 30:21 Do not abandon yourself to sorrow, do not torment yourself with brooding.

Sir 30:22 Gladness of heart is life to anyone, joy is what gives length of days.

Sir 30:23 Give your cares the slip, console your heart, chase sorrow far away; for sorrow has been the ruin of
many, and is no use to anybody.

Sir 30:24 Jealousy and anger shorten your days, and worry brings premature old age.

Sir 30:25 A genial heart makes a good trencherman, someöne who enjoys a good meal.

Sir 31:1 The sleeplessness brought by wealth makes a person lose weight, the worry it causes drives away
sleep.

Sir 31 :2 The worries of the daytime prevent you from sleeping, like a serious illness, they keep sleep at bay.

Sir 31 :3 The rich for ever toils, piling up money, and then, leaving off, he is gorged with luxuries;

Sir 31 :4 the poor for ever toils, barely making a living, and then, leaving off, is poorer than ever.

Sir 31 :5 No one who loves money can easily avoid sinning, whoëver pursues profit will be corrupted by it.

Sir 31 :6 Gold has been the ruin of many; their coming destruction was self-evident,

Sir 31 :7 since it is a snare for those who sacrifice to it and stupid people all get caught in it.

Sir 31 :8 Happy the rich who is found to be blameless and does not go chasing after gold.

Sir 31 :9 Who is he, so that we can congratulate him, for he has achieved marvels among his fellows?

Sir 31:10 Who has been through this test and emerged perfect? He may well be proud of that! Who has had the
chance to sin and has not sinned, had the chance to do wrong and has not done it?

Sir 31:11 His fortune will be firmly based and the assembly will acclaim his generosity.

Sir 31:12 If you are sitting down to a lavish table, do not display your greed, do not say, “What a lot to eat!”.

Sir 31:13 Remember, it is bad to have a greedy eye. Is any creature more wicked than the eye? - That is why it
is always weeping!

Sir 31:14 Do not reach out for anything your host has his eye on, do not jostle him at the dish.

Sir 31:15 Judge your fellow-guest’s needs by your own, be thoughtful in everyway.

Sir 31:16 Eat what is offered you like a well brought-up person, do not wolf your food or you will earn dislike.

Sir 31:17 For politeness’ sake be the first to stop; do not act the glutton, or you will give offence,

Sir 31:18 and if you are sitting with a large party, do not help yourself before the others do.

Sir 31:19 A little is quite enough for a well-bred person; his breathing is easy when he lies in bed.

Sir 31 :20 A moderate diet ensures sound sleep, one gets up early, in the best of spirits. Sleeplessness,
biliousness and gripe are what the glutton has to endure.

Sir 31 :21 If you are forced to eat too much, get up, go and vomit, and you will feel better.

Sir 31 :22 Listen to me, my child, do not disregard me, eventually you will see the force of my words. Be
moderate in all your activities and illness will never overtake you.

Sir 31 :23 People praise the person who keeps a splendid table, and their opinion of his munificence is sound.

Sir 31 :24 But a niggardly host provokes universal resentment and people will retail instances of his meanness.

Sir 31 :25 Do not play the valiant at your wine, for wine has been the undoing of many.

Sir 31 :26 The furnace proves the temper of steel, and wine proves hearts in the drinking bouts of braggarts.

Sir 31 :27 Wine gives life if drunk in moderation. What is life worth without wine? It came into being to make
people happy.

Sir 31 :28 Drunk at the right time and in the right amount, wine makes for a glad heart and a cheerful mind.

Sir 31 :29 Bitterness of soul comes of wine drunk to excess out of temper or bravado.

Sir 31 :30 Drunkenness excites the stupid to a fury to his own harm, it reduces his strength while leading to
blows.



Sir 31 :31 Do not provoke your fellow-guest at a wine feast, do not make fun of him when he is enjoying himself,
do not take him to task or annoy him by reclaiming money owed.

Sir 32:1 Have they made you the presider? Do not let it go to your head, behave like everyone else in the party,
see that they are happy and then sit down yourself.

Sir 32:2 Having discharged your duties, take your place so that your joy may be through theirs, and you may
receive the crown for your competence.

Sir 32:3 Speak, old man — it is proper that you should - but with discretion: do not spoil the music.

Sir 32:4 If someöne is singing, do not ramble on and do not play the sage at the wrong moment.

Sir 32:5 An amber seal on a precious stone, such is a concert of music at a wine feast.

Sir 32:6 An emerald seal in a golden setting, such are strains of music with a vintage wine.

Sir 32:7 Speak, young man, when you must, but twice at most, and then only if questioned.

Sir 32:8 Keep to the point, say much in few words; give the impression of knowing but not wanting to speak.

Sir 32:9 Among eminent people do not behave as though you were their equal; do not make frivolous remarks
when someöne else is speaking.

Sir 32:10 Lightning comes before the thunder, favour goes ahead of a modest person.

Sir 32:1 1 Leave in good time, do not bring up the rear, and hurry home without loitering.

Sir 32:12 There amuse yourself, and do what you have a mind to, but do not sin by arrogant talk.

Sir 32:13 And for all this bless your Creator, who intoxicates you with his favours.

Sir 32:14 Whoëver fears the Lord will accept his correction; those who look for him will win his favour.

Sir 32:15 Whoëver seeks the Law will be nourished by it, the hypocrite will find it a stumbling-block.

Sir 32:16 Those who fear the Lord win his approval, their good deeds shining like a light.

Sir 32:17 The sinner waves reproof aside, he finds an excuse for headstrong behaviour.

Sir 32:18 A sensible person never scorns a warning; foreigners and the proud do not know about fear.

Sir 32:19 Never act without reflection, and you will not regret your actions.

Sir 32:20 Do not venture on a rough road, for fear of stumbling over the stones.

Sir 32:21 Do not be over-confident on an even road
Sir 32:22 and beware of your own children.

Sir 32:23 Watch yourself in everything you do; this is also the way to keep the commandments.

Sir 32:24 Anyone who trusts in the Law obeys its precepts, no one who has confidence in the Lord will come to
harm.

Sir 33:1 No evil will befall one who fears the Lord, such a one will be rescued even in the ordeal.

Sir 33:2 No one who hates the Law is wise, one who is hypocritical about it is like a storm-tossed ship.

Sir 33:3 An intelligent person will put faith in the Law, for such a one the Law is as dependable as a prophecy.
Sir 33:4 Prepare what you have to say and you will get a hearing, marshal your information before you answer.
Sir 33:5 The feelings of a fool are like a cart-wheel, a fool’s thought revolves like a turning axle.

Sir 33:6 A rutting stallion is like a sarcastic friend; he neighs, whoëver rides him.

Sir 33:7 Why is one day better than another, though the sun gives the same daylight throughout the year?

Sir 33:8 They have been differentiated in the mind of the Lord, who has diversified the seasons and feasts;

Sir 33:9 some he has made more important and has hallowed, others he has made ordinary days.

Sir 33:10 Human beings come from the ground, Adam himself was formed out of earth;

Sir 33:1 1 in the fullness of his wisdom the Lord has made distinctions between them, and diversified their
conditions.

Sir 33:12 Some of them he has blessed, hallowing and setting them near him; others he has cursed and
humiliated by degrading them from their positions.

Sir 33:13 Like clay in the hands of the potter to mould as it pleases him, so are human beings in the hands of
their Maker to reward as he judges right.

Sir 33:14 Opposite evil stands good, opposite death, life; so too opposite the devout stands the sinner.

Sir 33:15 Contemplate all the works of the Most High, you will find they go in pairs, by opposites.

Sir 33:16 Although the last to come, I have kept my eyes open like a man picking up what the grape-pickers
have left.

Sir 33:17 By the blessing of the Lord I have come in first, and like a true grape-picker have filled my winepress.
Sir 33:18 And note, I have not been working merely for myself, but for all who seek instruction.

Sir 33:19 Listen to me, important public figures, presidents of the assembly, give ear!

Sir 33:20 Neither to son nor wife, brother nor friend, give power over yourself during your own lifetime. And do
not give your property to anyone else, in case you regret it and have to ask for it back.

Sir 33:21 As long as you live and there is breath in your body, do not yield power over yourself to anyone;

Sir 33:22 better for your children to come begging to you, than for you to have to go begging to them.

Sir 33:23 In all you do be the master, and leave a reputation unstained.

Sir 33:24 The day your life draws to a close, at the hour of death, then distribute your heritage.



Sir 33:25 Fodder, the stick and burdens for a donkey, bread, discipline and work for a slave.

Sir 33:26 Work your slave hard, and you will have peace of mind, leave his hands idle, and he will be asking for
his freedom.

Sir 33:27 Yoke and harness will bow the neck, for a bad servant, torments and the rack.

Sir 33:28 Set him to work, so that he will not be idle; idleness teaches every kind of mischief.

Sir 33:29 Keep him at his duties, where he should be, if he is disobedient, clap him in irons.

Sir 33:30 But do not be over-exacting with anyone, and do nothing contrary to justice.

Sir 33:31 You have only one slave? Treat him like yourself, since you have acquired him with blood.

Sir 33:32 You have only one slave? Treat him as a brother, since you need him as you need yourself.

Sir 33:33 If you ill-treat him and he runs away, which way will you go to look for him?

Sir 34:1 Vain and deceptive hopes are for the foolish, and dreams lend wings to fools.

Sir 34:2 As well clutch at shadows and chase the wind as put any faith in dreams.

Sir 34:3 Dreams are no different from mirrors; confronting a face, the reflection of that face.

Sir 34:4 What can be cleansed by uncleanness, what can be verified by falsehood?

Sir 34:5 Divinations, auguries and dreams are nonsense, like the fantasies of a pregnant woman.

Sir 34:6 Unless sent as emissaries from the Most High, do not give them a thought;

Sir 34:7 for dreams have led many astray, and those who relied on them have come to grief.

Sir 34:8 Fulfilling the Law requires no such falsehood, and wisdom is perfected in veracity.

Sir 34:9 A much travelled man knows many things, and a man of great experience will talk sound sense.

Sir 34:10 Someöne who has never had his trials knows little; but the travelled man is master of every situation.
Sir 34:1 1 I have seen many things on my travels, I have understood more than I can put into words.

Sir 34:12 I have often been in danger of death, but I have been spared, and this is why:

Sir 34:13 the spirit of those who fear the Lord can survive, for their hope is in someöne with power to save them.
Sir 34:14 No one who fears the Lord need ever hesitate, or ever be daunted, since the Lord is his hope.

Sir 34:15 Happy the soul of one who fears the Lord. On whom does he rely? Who supports him?

Sir 34:16 The eyes of the Lord watch over those who love him, he is their powerful protection and their strong
support, their screen from the desert wind, their shelter from the midday sun, a guard against stumbling, an
assurance against a fall.

Sir 34:17 He revives the spirit and brightens the eyes, he gives health, life and blessing.

Sir 34:18 The sacrifice of an offering unjustly acquired is a mockery; the gifts of the impious are unacceptable.
Sir 34:19 The Most High takes no pleasure in offerings from the godless, multiplying sacrifices will not gain
pardon for sin.

Sir 34:20 Offering sacrifice from the property of the poor is as bad as slaughtering a son before his father’s
eyes.

Sir 34:21 A meagre diet is the very life of the poor, to deprive them of it is to commit murder.

Sir 34:22 To take away a fellow-man’s livelihood is to kill him, to deprive an employee of his wages is to shed

blood.

Sir 34:23 If one person builds while another pulls down, what will they get out of it but trouble?

Sir 34:24 If one person prays and another calls down a curse, to which one’s voice is the Master going to listen?

Sir 34:25 If someöne washes after touching a corpse, and then touches it again, what is the good of his
washing?

Sir 34:26 Just so with someöne who fasts for sin, and then goes and commits it again. Who is going to hear that
person’s prayer? What is the good of the self-abasement?

Sir 35:1 One who keeps the Law multiplies offerings; one who follows the commandments offers communion
sacrifices.

Sir 35:2 Proof of gratitude is an offering of fine flour, almsgiving a sacrifice of praise.

Sir 35:3 To abandon wickedness is what pleases the Lord, to give up wrong-doing is an expiatory sacrifice.

Sir 35:4 Do not appear empty-handed in the Lord’s presence; for all these things are due under the
commandment.

Sir 35:5 The offering of the upright graces the altar, and its savour rises before the Most High.

Sir 35:6 The sacrifice of the upright is acceptable, its memorial will not be forgotten.

Sir 35:7 Honour the Lord with generosity, do not stint the first-fruits you bring.

Sir 35:8 Add a smiling face to all your gifts, and be cheerful as you dedicate your tithes.

Sir 35:9 Give to the Most High as he has given to you, as generously as your means can afford;

Sir 35:10 for the Lord is a good rewarder, he will reward you seven times over.

Sir 35:1 1 Do not try to bribe him with presents, he will not accept them, do not put your faith in wrongly
motivated sacrifices;

Sir 35:12 for the Lord is a judge who is utterly impartial.

Sir 35:13 He never shows partiality to the detriment of the poor, he listens to the plea of the injured party.



Sir 35:14 He does not ignore the orphan’s supplication, nor the widow’s as she pours out her complaint.

Sir 35:15 Do the widow’s tears not run down her cheeks, as she accuses the man who is the cause of them?

Sir 35:16 Whoëver wholeheartedly serves God will be accepted, his petitions will carry to the clouds.

Sir 35:17 The prayer of the humble pierces the clouds: and until it does, he is not to be consoled,

Sir 35:18 nor will he desist until the Most High takes notice of him, acquits the upright and delivers judgement.
Sir 35:19 And the Lord will not be slow, nor will he be dilatory on their behalf,

Sir 35:20 until he has crushed the loins of the merciless and exacted vengeance on the nations,

Sir 35:21 until he has eliminated the hordes of the arrogant and broken the sceptres of the wicked,

Sir 35:22 until he has repaid all people as their deeds deserve and human actions as their intentions merit,

Sir 35:23 until he has judged the case of his people and made them rejoice in his mercy.

Sir 35:24 Mercy is welcome in time of trouble, like rain clouds in time of drought.

Sir 36:1 Take pity on us, Master, Lord of the universe, look at us, spread fear of yourself throughout all other
nations.

Sir 36:2 Raise your hand against the foreign nations and let them see your might.

Sir 36:3 As, in their sight, you have proved yourself holy to us, so now, in our sight, prove yourself great to them.
Sir 36:4 Let them acknowledge you, just as we have acknowledged that there is no God but you, Lord.

Sir 36:5 Send new portents, do fresh wonders, win glory for your hand and your right arm.

Sir 36:6 Rouse your fury, pour out your rage, destroy the opponent, annihilate the enemy.

Sir 36:7 Hasten the day, remember the oath, and let people tell of your mighty deeds.

Sir 36:8 Let fiery wrath swallow up the survivor, and destruction overtake those who oppress your people.

Sir 36:9 Crush the heads of hostile rulers who say, “There is no one else but us!”.

Sir 36:10 Gather together all the tribes of Jacob, restore them their heritage as at the beginning.

Sir 36:1 1 Take pity, Lord, on the people called by your name, on Israel whom you have made your first-born.

Sir 36:12 Have compassion on your holy city, on Jerusalem, the place where you rest.

Sir 36:13 Fill Zion with your praises and your sanctuary with your glory.

Sir 36:14 Vindicate those whom you created first, fulfil what has been prophesied in your name.

Sir 36:15 Give those who wait for you their reward, let your prophets be proved true.

Sir 36:16 Grant, Lord, the prayer of your servants, in the terms of Aaron’s blessing on your people,

Sir 36:17 so that all the earth’s inhabitants may acknowledge that you are the Lord, the everlasting God.

Sir 36:18 The stomach takes in all kinds of food, but some foods are better than others.

Sir 36:19 As the palate discerns the flavour of game, so a shrewd listener detects lying words.

Sir 36:20 A perverse character causes depression in others; it needs experience to know how to repay such a
one.

Sir 36:21 A woman will accept any husband, but some daughters are better than others.

Sir 36:22 A woman’s beauty delights the beholder, a man likes nothing better.

Sir 36:23 If her tongue is kind and gentle, her husband is the happiest of men.

Sir 36:24 The man who takes a wife has the makings of a fortune, a helper to match himself, a pillar of support.
Sir 36:25 When property has no fence, it is open to plunder, when a man has no wife, he is aimless and
querulous.

Sir 36:26 Will anyone trust an armed thief who flits from town to town?

Sir 36:27 So it is with the man who has no nest, and lodges wherever night overtakes him.

Sir 37:1 Any friend will say, “I am your friend too”, but some friends are friends only in name.

Sir 37:2 Is it not a deadly sorrow when a comrade or a friend turns enemy?

Sir 37:3 O evil inclination, why were you created, to cover the earth with deceit?

Sir 37:4 One kind of comrade congratulates a friend in prosperity but in time of trouble appears on the other
side.

Sir 37:5 One kind of comrade genuinely feels for a friend and when it comes to a fight, springs to arms.

Sir 37:6 Do not forget the genuine friend, do not push him out of mind once you are rich.

Sir 37:7 Any adviser will offer advice, but some are governed by self-interest.

Sir 37:8 Beware of someöne who offers advice; first find out what he wants himself- since his advice coincides
with his own interest — in case he has designs on you

Sir 37:9 and tells you, “You are on the right road”, but stands well clear to see what will happen to you.

Sir 37:10 Do not consult anyone who looks at you askance, conceal your plans from people jealous of you.

Sir 37:1 1 Do not consult a woman about her rival, or a coward about war, a merchant about prices, or a buyer
about selling, anyone mean about gratitude, or anyone selfish about kindness, a lazy fellow about any sort of
work, or a casual worker about finishing a job, an idle servant about a major undertaking — do not rely on these
for any advice.

Sir 37:12 But have constant recourse to some devout person, whom you know to be a keeper of the
commandments, whose soul matches your own, and who, if you go wrong, will be sympathetic.



Sir 37:13 Finally, stick to the advice your own heart gives you, no one can be truer to you than that;

Sir 37:14 since a person’s soul often gives a clearer warning than seven watchmen perched on a watchtower.

Sir 37:15 And besides all this beg the Most High to guide your steps into the truth.

Sir 37:16 Reason should be the basis for every activity, reflection must come before any undertaking.

Sir 37:17 Thoughts are rooted in the heart, and this sends out four branches:

Sir 37:18 good and evil, life and death, and mistress of them always is the tongue.

Sir 37:19 One kind of person is clever at teaching others, yet is no good whatever to himself;

Sir 37:20 another, very eloquent, is detested and ends by starving to death,

Sir 37:21 not having won the favour of the Lord, and being destitute of all wisdom.

Sir 37:22 Another considers himself wise and proclaims his intellectual conclusions as certainties.

Sir 37:23 But the truly wise instructs his people and his intellectual conclusions are certainties.

Sir 37:24 The wise is showered with blessings, and all who see him will call him happy.

Sir 37:25 Human life lasts a number of days, but the days of Israel are beyond counting.

Sir 37:26 The wise will earn confidence among the people, his name will live for ever.

Sir 37:27 During your life, my child, see what suits your constitution, do not give it what you find disagrees with
it;

Sir 37:28 for not everything is good for everybody, nor does everybody like everything.

Sir 37:29 Do not be insatiable for any delicacy, do not be greedy for food,

Sir 37:30 for over-eating leads to illness and excess leads to liver-attacks.

Sir 37:31 Many people have died from over-eating; control yourself, and so prolong your life.

Sir 38:1 Treat the doctor with the honour that is his due, in consideration of his services; for he too has been

created by the Lord.

Sir 38:2 Healing itself comes from the Most High, like a gift received from a king.

Sir 38:3 The doctor’s learning keeps his head high, and the great regard him with awe.

Sir 38:4 The Lord has brought forth medicinal herbs from the ground, and no one sensible will despise them.

Sir 38:5 Did not a piece of wood once sweeten the water, thus giving proof of its power?

Sir 38:6 He has also given some people knowledge, so that they may draw credit from his mighty works.

Sir 38:7 He uses these for healing and relieving pain; the druggist makes up a mixture from them.

Sir 38:8 Thus, there is no end to his activities; thanks to him, well-being exists throughout the world.

Sir 38:9 My child, when you are ill, do not rebel, but pray to the Lord and he will heal you.

Sir 38:10 Renounce your faults, keep your hands unsoiled, and cleanse your heart from all sin.

Sir 38:1 1 Offer incense and a memorial of fine flour, make as rich an offering as you can afford.

Sir 38:12 Then let the doctor take over — the Lord created him too — do not let him leave you, for you need him.

Sir 38:13 There are times when good health depends on doctors.

Sir 38:14 For they, in their turn, will pray the Lord to grant them the grace to relieve and to heal, and so prolong
your life.

Sir 38:15 Whoëver sins in the eyes of his Maker, let such a one come under the care of the doctor!

Sir 38:16 My child, shed tears over the dead, lament for the dead to show your sorrow, then bury the body with
due ceremony and do not fail to honour the grave.

Sir 38:17 Weep bitterly, beat your breast, observe the mourning the dead deserves for a day or two, to avoid
censorious comment, and then be comforted in your sorrow;

Sir 38:18 for grief can lead to death, a grief-stricken heart loses all energy.

Sir 38:19 In affliction sorrow persists, a life of grief is hard to bear.

Sir 38:20 Do not abandon your heart to grief, drive it away, bear your own end in mind.

Sir 38:21 Do not forget, there is no coming back; you cannot help the dead, and you will harm yourself.

Sir 38:22 “Remember my doom, since it will be yours too; I yesterday, you today!”.

Sir 38:23 Once the dead are laid to rest, let their memory rest, do not fret for them, once their spirit departs.

Sir 38:24 Leisure gives the scribe the chance to acquire wisdom; a man with few commitments can grow wise.
Sir 38:25 How can the ploughman become wise, whose sole ambition is to wield the goad, driving his oxen,
engrossed in their work, his conversation limited to bullocks,

Sir 38:26 his thoughts absorbed in the furrows he traces and his long evenings spent in fattening heifers?

Sir 38:27 Similarly with all workmen and craftsmen, toiling day and night; those who engrave seals, for ever
trying to think of a new design, concentrating on catching a good likeness and staying up late to get the work
done.

Sir 38:28 Similarly with the blacksmith sitting by his anvil; he considers what to do with the pig-iron, the breath of
the fire scorches his skin, as he contends with the heat of the furnace; the noise of the hammer deafens him, his
eyes are fixed on the pattern; he concentrates on getting the job done well and stays up late to apply the
finishing touches.

Sir 38:29 Similarly with the potter, sitting at his work, turning the wheel with his feet; constantly on the alert over



his work, each flick of the finger premeditated;

Sir 38:30 he pummels the clay with his arm, and with his feet he kneads it; he concentrates on applying the
glaze right and stays up late to clean the kiln.

Sir 38:31 All these people rely on their hands and each is skilled at his own craft.

Sir 38:32 A town could not be inhabited without them, there would be no settling, no travelling.

Sir 38:33 But you will not find them in the parliament, they do not hold high rank in the assembly. They do not sit
on the judicial bench, and they do not meditate on the Law.

Sir 38:34 They are not remarkable for their culture or judgement, nor are they found frequenting the
philosophers. They sustain the structure of the world, and their prayer is concerned with their trade.

Sir 39:1 Not so with one who concentrates his mind and his meditation on the Law of the Most High. He
researches into the wisdom of all the Ancients, he occupies his time with the prophecies.

Sir 39:2 He preserves the discourses of famous men, he is at home with the niceties of parables.

Sir 39:3 He researches into the hidden sense of proverbs, he ponders the obscurities of parables.

Sir 39:4 He enters the service of princes, he is seen in the presence of rulers. He travels in foreign countries, he
has experienced human good and human evil.

Sir 39:5 At dawn and with all his heart he turns to the Lord his Creator; he pleads in the presence of the Most
High, he opens his mouth in prayer and makes entreaty for his sins.

Sir 39:6 If such be the will of the great Lord, he will be filled with the spirit of intelligence, he will shower forth
words of wisdom, and in prayer give thanks to the Lord.

Sir 39:7 He will grow upright in purpose and learning, he will ponder the Lord’s hidden mysteries.

Sir 39:8 He will display the instruction he has received, taking his pride in the Law of the Lord’s covenant.

Sir 39:9 Many will praise his intelligence and it will never be forgotten. His memory will not disappear,
generation after generation his name will live.

Sir 39:10 Nations will proclaim his wisdom, the assembly will celebrate his praises.

Sir 39:1 1 If he lives long, his name will be more glorious than a thousand others, and if he dies, that will satisfy
him just as well.

Sir 39:12 And here are some more of my reflections: yes, I am as full as the moon at the full!

Sir 39:13 Listen to me, devout children, and blossom like the rose that grows on the bank of a watercourse.

Sir 39:14 Give off a sweet smell like incense, flower like the lily, spread your fragrance abroad, sing a song of
praise blessing the Lord for all his works.

Sir 39:15 Declare the greatness of his name, proclaim his praise with song and with lyre, and this is how you
must sing his praises:

Sir 39:16 “How wonderful, the actions of the Lord! Whatever he orders is done at the proper time!”. You must not
say, “What is this? Why is that?”. There is a proper time for every question.

Sir 39:17 At his word, the water stops and piles up high, at his voice, the watery reservoirs take shape,

Sir 39:18 at his command, whatever he wants is done, no one can stop him, if he intends to save.

Sir 39:19 He can see whatever human beings are doing, nothing can be hidden from his eye;

Sir 39:20 his gaze stretches from eternity to eternity, and nothing can astonish him.

Sir 39:21 You must not say, “What is this? Why is that?”. for everything has been made for a purpose.

Sir 39:22 As his blessing covers the dry land like a river and soaks it like a flood,

Sir 39:23 so retribution is his legacy to the nations, just as he has turned fresh waters to salt.

Sir 39:24 His ways are as smooth for the devout, as they are full of obstacles for the wicked.

Sir 39:25 Good things were created from the beginning for good people, as bad ones were for sinners.

Sir 39:26 The prime needs of human beings for living are water and fire, iron and salt, wheat-flour, milk and
honey, the juice of the grape, oil and clothing.

Sir 39:27 All these are good for those who are good, but turn out bad for sinners.

Sir 39:28 Some winds have been created for punishing, in his fury, he uses them as scourges; on the day of
doom, they unleash their violence and appease the wrath of their Creator.

Sir 39:29 Fire and hail, famine and death, have all been created for punishing.

Sir 39:30 Wild animals’ fangs, scorpions, vipers, the avenging sword for the ruin of the godless:

Sir 39:31 all of them exult in discharging his orders, ready on earth whenever the need arises and, when their
time comes, not falling short of his word.

Sir 39:32 That is why I was determined from the outset, why I have pondered and why I have written,

Sir 39:33 “The works of the Lord are all good, when the time is right, he gives whatever is needed.

Sir 39:34 You must not say, ‘This is worse than that’, for, sooner or later, everything proves its worth.

Sir 39:35 So now, sing with all your heart and voice, and bless the name of the Lord!”.

Sir 40:1 A hard lot has been created for human beings, a heavy yoke lies on the children of Adam from the day
they come out of their mother’s womb, until the day they return to the mother of them all.

Sir 40:2 What fills them with foreboding and their hearts with fear is dread of the day of death.



Sir 40:3 From the one who sits on a glorious throne to the wretch in dust and ashes,

Sir 40:4 from the one who wears purple and a crown to the one dressed in sacking, all is fury and jealousy,
turmoil and unrest, fear of death, rivalry, strife.

Sir 40:5 And even at night while he rests on his bed his sleep only gives a new twist to his worries:

Sir 40:6 scarcely has he lain down to rest, when in his sleep, as if in broad daylight, he is troubled with
nightmares, like one who has escaped from a battle,

Sir 40:7 and at the moment of rescue he wakes up, amazed that there was nothing to be afraid of!

Sir 40:8 For all creatures, human and animal — and seven times more for sinners-
Sir40:9 there is death and blood and strife and the sword, disasters, famine, affliction, plague.

Sir 40:10 These things were all created for the wicked, and the Flood came because of them.

Sir 40:1 1 All that comes from the earth returns to the earth, and what comes from the water returns to the sea.
Sir 40:12 All bribery and injustice will be blotted out, but good faith will stand for ever.

Sir 40:13 Ill-gotten wealth will vanish like a torrent, like the single thunder-clap that heralds rain.

Sir 40:14 When he opens his hand, he rejoices, by the same token, sinners come to ruin.

Sir 40:15 The sprigs of the godless will not make many branches, tainted roots find only hard rock.

Sir 40:16 The reed that grows by every lake and river’s edge is the first plant to be uprooted.

Sir 40:17 Charity is a very paradise of blessing and almsgiving endures for ever.

Sir 40:18 For a person of private means and one who works hard, life is pleasant, better off than either, one who
finds a treasure.

Sir 40:19 Children and the founding of a city perpetuate a name: more esteemed than either, a perfect wife.

Sir 40:20 Wine and music cheer the heart; better than either, the love of wisdom.

Sir 40:21 Flute and harp add sweetness to a song; better than either, a melodious voice.

Sir 40:22 The eye longs for grace and beauty; better than either, the green of spring corn.

Sir 40:23 Friend or comrade — it is always well met; better than either, a wife and husband.

Sir 40:24 Brothers and allies are good in times of trouble; better than either, almsgiving to the rescue.

Sir 40:25 Gold and silver will steady your feet; more esteemed than either, good advice.

Sir 40:26 Money and strength make a confident heart; better than either, the fear of the Lord. With fear of the
Lord, nothing is lacking: no need to seek for other help.

Sir 40:27 Fear of the Lord is a paradise of blessing, a better protection than the highest reputation.

Sir 40:28 My child, do not live by sponging off others, better be dead than be a sponger.

Sir 40:29 A life spent in eyeing someöne else’s table cannot be accounted a life at all. Other people’s food
defiles the gullet; a wise, well-brought-up person will beware of doing this.

Sir 40:30 What a sponger says may sound very sweet but in his belly there burns a fire.

Sir 41:1 O death, how bitter it is to remember you for someöne peacefully living with his possessions, for
someöne with no worries and everything going well and who can still enjoy his food!

Sir 41 :2 O death, your sentence is welcome to one in want, whose strength is failing, to one worn out with age
and a thousand worries, resentful and impatient!

Sir 41 :3 Do not dread death’s sentence; remember those who came before you and those who will come after.
Sir 41 :4 This is the sentence passed on all living creatures by the Lord, so why object to what seems good to
the Most High? Whether your life lasts ten or a hundred or a thousand years, its length will not be held against
you in Sheol.

Sir 41 :5 Hateful brats, such are the children of sinners, who foregather in the haunts of the godless.

Sir 41 :6 The inheritance of sinners’ children is doomed to perish, their posterity will endure lasting reproach.

Sir 41 :7 A godless father will be blamed by his children for the reproach he has brought on them.

Sir 41 :8 A bad outlook for you, godless people, who have forsaken the Law of God Most High.

Sir 41 :9 When you were born, you were born to be accursed, and when you die, that curse will be your portion.
Sir 41:10 All that comes from the earth returns to the earth, so too the wicked proceed from curse to destruction.
Sir 41:11 Mourning concerns only the bodies of the dead, but the worthless name of sinners will be blotted out.
Sir 41:12 Be careful of your reputation, for it will last you longer than a thousand great hoards of gold.

Sir 41:13 A good life lasts a certain number of days, but a good reputation lasts for ever.

Sir 41:14 Keep my instructions and be at peace, my children. Wisdom hidden away and treasure undisplayed,
what use is either of these?

Sir 41:1 5 Better someöne who hides his folly than one who hides his wisdom.

Sir 41:16 Preserve a sense of shame in the following matters, for not every kind of shame is right to harbour,
nor is every situation correctly appraised by all.

Sir 41:1 7 Be ashamed, before father and mother, of depraved behaviour, and before prince or potentate of
telling lies;

Sir 41:1 8 of wrong-doing before judge or magistrate, and of impiety before the assembly of the people;

Sir 41:1 9 of sharp practice before your companion and your friend, and of theft before the neighbourhood you



live in.

Sir 41 :20 Before the truth and covenant of God, be ashamed of leaning elbows on the table,

Sir 41 :21 of being ungracious when giving or receiving, of ignoring those who greet you,

Sir 41 :22 of gazing at a loose woman, of repulsing your fellow-countryman,

Sir 41 :23 of misappropriating another’s portion or gift, of paying court to another man’s wife,

Sir 41 :24 of making advances to his servant-girl — do not go near her bed-

Sir 41 :25 of saying disagreeable things to friends — do not follow up a gift with a taunt-

Sir 41 :26 of repeating everything you hear and of betraying confidences.

Sir 41 :27 Then you will know what true shame is, and you will find yourself in everyone’s graces.

Sir 42:1 The following things you should not be ashamed of, and do not sin from fear of what others think:

Sir 42:2 of the Law of the Most High or of the covenant, of a verdict that acquits the godless,

Sir 42:3 of keeping accounts with a travelling companion, of settling property on your friends,

Sir 42:4 of being accurate over scales and weights, of making small and large profits,

Sir 42:5 of gaining from commercial transactions, of disciplining your children strictly, of lashing a wicked slave
until you draw blood.

Sir 42:6 With an interfering wife, it is as well to use your seal, and where there are many hands, lock things up.
Sir 42:7 Whatever stores you issue, do it by number and weight, spendings and takings, put everything in
writing.

Sir 42:8 Do not be ashamed to correct a stupid person or a fool, or an old dotard who bickers with young
people. Then you will show yourself really educated and win the approval of everyone.

Sir 42:9 Unknown to her, a daughter keeps her father awake, the worry she gives him drives away his sleep: in
her youth, in case she never marries, married, in case she should be disliked,

Sir 42:10 as a virgin, in case she should be defiled and found with child in her father’s house, having a husband,
in case she goes astray, married, in case she should be sterile!

Sir 42:1 1 Your daughter is headstrong? Keep a sharp look-out that she does not make you the laughing-stock of
your enemies, the talk of the town, the object of common gossip, and put you to public shame.

Sir 42:12 Do not stare at any man for his good looks, do not sit down with women;

Sir 42:13 for moth comes out of clothes, and woman’s spite out of woman.

Sir 42:14 Better a man’s spite than a woman’s kindness: women give rise to shame and reproach.

Sir 42:15 Next, I shall remind you of the works of the Lord, and tell of what I have seen. By the words of the Lord
his works come into being and all creation obeys his will.

Sir 42:16 The shining sun looks down on all things, and the work of the Lord is full of his glory.

Sir 42:17 The Lord has not granted the Holy Ones the power to tell of all his marvels which the Almighty Lord
has solidly constructed for the universe to stand firm in his glory.

Sir 42:18 He has fathomed both the abyss and the human heart and seen into their devious ways; for the Most
High knows all there is to know and sees the signs of the times.

Sir 42:19 He declares what is past and what will be, and reveals the trend of hidden things.

Sir 42:20 Not a thought escapes him, not a single word is hidden from him.

Sir 42:21 He has embellished the magnificent works of his wisdom, he is from everlasting to everlasting, nothing
can be added to him, nothing taken away, he needs no one’s advice.

Sir 42:22 How lovely, all his works, how dazzling to the eye!

Sir 42:23 They all live and last for ever, and, whatever the circumstances, all obey.

Sir 42:24 All things go in pairs, by opposites, he has not made anything imperfect:

Sir 42:25 one thing complements the excellence of another. Who could ever grow tired of gazing at his glory?

Sir 43:1 Pride of the heights, a clear vault of the sky — such is the beauty of the heavens, a glorious sight.

Sir 43:2 The sun, as he emerges, proclaims at his rising, “How wonderful a thing, the work of the Most High!”.

Sir 43:3 At his zenith, he parches the ground, who can withstand his blaze?

Sir 43:4 We have to blow the furnace to produce any heat, the sun burns the mountains three times as much;
breathing out blasts of fire, flashing his rays, he dazzles the eyes.

Sir 43:5 Great is the Lord who created him and whose word speeds him on his course.

Sir 43:6 And then the moon, ever punctual to mark the times, an everlasting sign:

Sir 43:7 It is the moon that signals the feasts, a luminary that wanes after being full.

Sir 43:8 The month derives its name from hers, she waxes wonderfully in her phases, banner of the hosts on
high, shining in the vault of heaven.

Sir 43:9 The glory of the stars makes the beauty of the sky, a brilliant adornment of the Lord on High.

Sir 43:10 At the words of the Holy One they stand as he decrees, and never grow slack at their watch.

Sir 43:1 1 See the rainbow and praise its Maker, so superbly beautiful in its splendour.

Sir 43:12 Across the sky it forms a glorious arc drawn by the hands of the Most High.

Sir 43:13 By his command he sends the snow, he speeds the lightning by his command.



Sir 43:14 In the same way, his treasuries open and the clouds fly out like birds.

Sir 43:15 His great power solidifies the clouds, then pulverises them into hail.

Sir 43:16 at the sight of him, the mountains quake. At his will the south wind blows, or the storm from the north
and the whirlwind.

Sir 43:17 At the roar of his thunder, the earth writhes in labour,

Sir 43:18 He sprinkles snow like birds alighting, it comes down like locusts settling. The eye marvels at the
beauty of its whiteness, and the mind is amazed at its falling.

Sir 43:19 Over the earth, like salt, he also pours hoarfrost, which, when it freezes, bristles like thorns.

Sir 43:20 The cold wind blows from the north, and ice forms on the water; it forms on every piece of standing
water, covering it like a breastplate.

Sir 43:21 The wind swallows up the mountains and scorches the desert, like a fire it consumes the vegetation.
Sir 43:22 But cloud brings swift healing, and dew brings joy after the heat.

Sir 43:23 By his own resourcefulness he has tamed the abyss, and planted it with islands.

Sir 43:24 Those who sail the sea tell of its dangers, their accounts fill our ears with amazement:

Sir 43:25 for there too exist strange and wonderful works, animals of every kind and huge sea creatures.

Sir 43:26 Thanks to God, his messenger reaches port, everything works out according to his word.

Sir 43:27 We could say much more and still fall short; to put it concisely, “He is all”.

Sir 43:28 Where shall we find sufficient power to glorify him, since he is the Great One, above all his works,

Sir 43:29 the awe-inspiring Lord, stupendously great, and wonderful in his power?

Sir 43:30 Exalt the Lord in your praises as high as you may — still he surpasses you. Exert all your strength
when you exalt him, do not grow tired — you will never come to the end.

Sir 43:31 Who has ever seen him to describe him? Who can glorify him as he deserves?

Sir 43:32 Many mysteries remain even greater than these, for we have seen only a few of his works,

Sir 43:33 the Lord himself having created all things and given wisdom to those who are devout.

Sir 44:1 Next let us praise illustrious men, our ancestors in their successive generations.

Sir 44:2 The Lord has created an abundance of glory, and displayed his greatness from earliest times.

Sir 44:3 Some wielded authority as kings and were renowned for their strength; others were intelligent advisers
and uttered prophetic sayings.

Sir 44:4 Others directed the people by their advice, by their understanding of the popular mind, and by the wise
words of their teaching;

Sir 44:5 others composed musical melodies and set down ballads;

Sir 44:6 others were rich and powerful, living peacefully in their homes.

Sir 44:7 All these were honoured by their contemporaries and were the glory of their day.

Sir 44:8 Some of them left a name behind them, so that their praises are still sung.

Sir 44:9 While others have left no memory, and disappeared as though they had not existed. They are now as
though they had never been, and so too, their children after them.

Sir 44:10 But here is a list of illustrious men whose good works have not been forgotten.

Sir 44:1 1 In their descendants they find a rich inheritance, their posterity.

Sir 44:12 Their descendants stand by the commandments and, thanks to them, so do their children’s children.
Sir 44:13 Their offspring will last for ever, their glory will not fade.

Sir 44:14 Their bodies have been buried in peace, and their name lives on for all generations.

Sir 44:15 The peoples will proclaim their wisdom, the assembly will celebrate their praises.

Sir 44:16 Enoch pleased the Lord and was transferred to heaven, an example for the conversion of all
generations.

Sir 44:17 Noah was found perfectly upright, in the time of retribution he became the heir: because of him a
remnant was preserved for the earth at the coming of the Flood.

Sir 44:18 Everlasting covenants were made with him that never again should every living creature perish by
flood.

Sir 44:19 Abraham, the great ancestor of a host of nations, no one was ever his equal in glory.

Sir 44:20 He observed the Law of the Most High, and entered into a covenant with him. He confirmed the
covenant in his own flesh, and proved himself faithful under ordeal.

Sir 44:21 The Lord therefore promised him on oath to bless the nations through his descendants, to multiply him
like the dust on the ground, to exalt his descendants like the stars, and to give them the land as their heritage,
from one sea to the other, from the River to the ends of the earth.

Sir 44:22 To Isaac too, for the sake of Abraham his father, he assured

Sir 44:23 the blessing of all humanity; he caused the covenant to rest on the head of Jacob. He confirmed him
in his blessings and gave him the land as his inheritance; he divided it into portions, and shared it out among the
twelve tribes.

Sir 45:1 From Jacob’s stock he produced a generous man who found favour in the eyes of all humanity, beloved



by God and people, Moses, of blessed memory.

Sir 45:2 He made him the equal of the holy ones in glory and made him strong, to the terror of his enemies.

Sir 45:3 By the word of Moses, he made prodigies cease and raised him high in the respect of kings; he gave
him commandments for his people, and showed him something of his glory.

Sir 45:4 For his loyalty and gentleness he sanctified him, choosing him alone out of all human beings;

Sir 45:5 he allowed him to hear his voice, and led him into the darkness;

Sir 45:6 he gave him the commandments face to face, the law of life and knowledge, to teach Jacob his
ordinances and Israel his decrees. He raised up Aaron, a holy man like Moses, his brother, of the tribe of Levi.
Sir 45:7 He made an everlasting covenant with him, and gave him the priesthood of the people. He adorned him
with impressive vestments, he dressed him in a robe of glory.

Sir 45:8 He clothed him in glorious perfection and invested him with rich ornaments, the breeches, the long
robe, the <i>ephod</i>.

Sir 45:9 To surround the robe he gave him pomegranates, and many gold bells all round to chime at every step,
for their sound to be heard in the Temple as a reminder to the children of his people;

Sir 45:10 and a sacred vestment of gold and aquamarine and scarlet, the work of an embroiderer; the pectoral
of judgement, the urim and thummim, of plaited crimson, the work of a craftsman;

Sir 45:1 1 precious stones cut like seals mounted in gold, the work of a jeweller, as a reminder with their
engraved inscriptions of the number of the tribes of Israel;

Sir 45:12 and a golden diadem on his turban, engraved with the seal of consecration; superb ornamentation,
magnificent work, adornment to delight the eye.

Sir 45:13 There had never been such lovely things before him, and no one else has ever put them on, but only
his own sons, and his descendants for all time.

Sir 45:14 His sacrifices were to be burnt entirely, twice each day and for ever.

Sir 45:15 Moses consecrated him and anointed him with holy oil; and this was an everlasting covenant for him,
and for his descendants as long as the heavens endure, that he should preside over worship, act as priest, and
bless the people in the name of the Lord.

Sir 45:16 He chose him out of all the living to offer sacrifices to the Lord, incense and perfume as a memorial to
make expiation for the people.

Sir 45:17 He entrusted him with his commandments, committed to him the statutes of the Law for him to teach
Jacob his decrees and enlighten Israel on his Law.

Sir 45:18 Others plotted against him, they were jealous of him in the desert, Dathan and Abiram and their men,
Korah and his crew in fury and rage.

Sir 45:19 The Lord saw it and was displeased, his raging fury made an end of them; he worked miracles on
them, consuming them by his flaming fire.

Sir 45:20 And he added to Aaron’s glory, he gave him an inheritance; he allotted him the offerings of the first-
fruits, before all else, as much bread as he could want.

Sir 45:21 Thus they eat the sacrifices of the Lord which he gave to him and his posterity.

Sir 45:22 But of the people’s territory he inherits nothing, he alone of all the people has no share, “For I myself
am your share and heritage”.

Sir 45:23 Phinehas son of Eleazar is third in glory because of his zeal in the fear of the Lord, because he stood
firm when the people revolted, with a staunch and courageous heart; and in this way made expiation for Israel.
Sir 45:24 Hence a covenant of peace was sealed with him, making him governor of both sanctuary and people,
and securing to him and his descendants the high priestly dignity for ever.

Sir 45:25 There was also a covenant with David son of Jesse, of the tribe of Judah, a royal succession by
exclusively linear descent, but the succession of Aaron passes to all his descendants.

Sir 45:26 May God endow your hearts with wisdom to judge his people uprightly, so that the virtues of your
ancestors may never fade, and their glory may pass to all their descendants!

Sir 46:1 Mighty in war was Joshua son of Nun, successor to Moses in the prophetic office, who well deserved
his name, and was a great saviour of the chosen people, wreaking vengeance on the enemies who opposed
him, and so bringing Israel into its inheritance.

Sir 46:2 How splendid he was when, arms uplifted, he brandished his sword against cities!

Sir 46:3 Who had ever shown such determination as his? He himself led the battles of the Lord.

Sir 46:4 Was not the sun held back by his hand, and one day drawn out into two?

Sir 46:5 He called on the Most High, the Mighty One, while pressing the enemies from all directions, and the
great Lord answered him with hard and violent hailstones.

Sir 46:6 He fell on that enemy nation, and at the Descent destroyed all resistance to make the nations
acknowledge his warlike prowess and that he was waging war on behalf of the Lord.

Sir 46:7 For he was a follower of the Mighty One, in the time of Moses showing his devotion, he and Caleb son
of Jephunneh, by opposing the whole community, by preventing the people from sinning, and by silencing the



mutters of rebellion.

Sir 46:8 Hence these two alone were preserved out of six hundred thousand men on the march, and brought
into their inheritance, into a land where milk and honey flow.

Sir 46:9 And the Lord conferred strength on Caleb too, which stayed by him into old age, so that he could invest
the highlands of the country which his descendants kept as their inheritance,

Sir 46:10 so that every Israelite might see that it is good to follow the Lord.

Sir 46:1 1 The Judges too, each when he was called, all men whose hearts were never disloyal, who never
turned their backs on the Lord — may their memory be blessed!

Sir 46:12 May their bones flourish again from the tomb, and may the names of those illustrious men be worthily
borne by their sons!

Sir 46:13 Samuel was the beloved of his Lord; prophet of the Lord, he instituted the kingdom, and anointed
rulers over his people.

Sir 46:14 By the Law of the Lord he judged the assembly, and the Lord watched over Jacob.

Sir 46:15 By his loyalty he was recognised as a prophet, by his words he was known to be a trustworthy seer.

Sir 46:16 He called on the Lord, the Mighty One, when his enemies pressed in from all directions, by offering a
sucking lamb.

Sir 46:17 And the Lord thundered from heaven, and made his voice heard in a rolling peal;

Sir 46:18 he massacred the leaders of the enemy, and all the rulers of the Philistines.

Sir 46:19 Before the time of his everlasting rest he bore witness to the Lord and his anointed, “Of no property,
not even a pair of sandals, have I ever deprived a soul”. Nor did anyone accuse him.

Sir 46:20 And, having fallen asleep, he prophesied again, warning the king of his end; he spoke from the depths
of the earth in prophecy, to blot out the wickedness of the people.

Sir 47:1 After him arose Nathan, to prophesy in the time of David.

Sir 47:2 As the fat is set apart from the communion sacrifice, so was David chosen out of the Israelites.

Sir 47:3 He played with lions as though with kids, and with bears as though with lambs.

Sir 47:4 While still a boy, did he not slay the giant and take away the people’s shame, by hurling a stone from
his sling and cutting short the boasting of Goliath?

Sir 47:5 For he called on the Lord Most High, who gave strength to his right arm to put a mighty warrior to death
and assert the strength of his own people.

Sir 47:6 Hence they gave him credit for ten thousand, and praised him while they blessed the Lord, by offering
him a crown of glory.

Sir 47:7 For he destroyed the enemies on every front, he annihilated his foes, the Philistines, and crushed their
strength for ever.

Sir 47:8 In all his activities he gave thanks to the Holy One Most High in words of glory; he put all his heart into
his songs out of love for his Creator.

Sir 47:9 He placed singers before the altar, melodiously to sing;

Sir 47:10 he gave the feasts their splendour, the festivals their solemn pomp, causing the Lord’s holy name to
be praised and the sanctuary to resound from dawn.

Sir 47:1 1 The Lord took away his sins, making his strength ever greater; he gave him a royal covenant, and a
glorious throne in Israel.

Sir 47:12 A wise son succeeded him, who lived content, thanks to him.

Sir 47:13 Solomon reigned in a time of peace, and God gave him peace all round so that he could raise a house
to his name and prepare an everlasting sanctuary.

Sir 47:14 How wise you were despite your youth, like a river, brimming over with intelligence!

Sir 47:15 Your mind ranged the earth, you filled it with mysterious sayings.

Sir 47:16 Your name reached the distant islands, and you were loved for your peace.

Sir 47:17 Your songs, your proverbs, your sayings and your answers were the wonder of the world.

Sir 47:18 In the name of the Lord God, of him who is called the God of Israel, you amassed gold like so much
tin, and made silver as common as lead.

Sir 47:19 You abandoned your body to women, you became the slave of your appetites.

Sir 47:20 You stained your honour, you profaned your stock, so bringing retribution on your children and
affliction for your folly:

Sir 47:21 the empire split in two, from Ephraim arose a rebel kingdom.

Sir 47:22 But the Lord never goes back on his mercy, never cancels any of his words, will neither deny offspring
to his elect nor stamp out the line of the man who loved him. And hence, he has granted a remnant to Jacob and
to David a root sprung from him.

Sir 47:23 Solomon rested with his ancestors, leaving one of his stock as his successor, the stupidest member of
the nation, brainless Rehoboam, who drove the people to rebel.

Sir 47:24 Next, Jeroboam son of Nebat, who made Israel sin, and set Ephraim on the way of evil; from then on



their sins multiplied so excessively as to drive them out of their country;

Sir 47:25 for they tried out every kind of wickedness, until vengeance overtook them.

Sir 48:1 Then the prophet Elijah arose like a fire, his word flaring like a torch.

Sir 48:2 It was he who brought famine on them and decimated them in his zeal.

Sir 48:3 By the word of the Lord he shut up the heavens, three times also he brought down fire.

Sir 48:4 How glorious you were in your miracles, Elijah! Has anyone reason to boast as you have? -
Sir 48:5 rousing a corpse from death, from Sheol, by the word of the Most High;

Sir 48:6 dragging kings down to destruction, and high dignitaries from their beds;

Sir 48:7 hearing a rebuke on Sinai and decrees of punishment on Horeb;

Sir 48:8 anointing kings as avengers, and prophets to succeed you;

Sir 48:9 taken up in the whirlwind of fire, in a chariot with fiery horses;

Sir 48:10 designated in the prophecies of doom to allay God’s wrath before the fury breaks, to turn the hearts of
fathers towards their children, and to restore the tribes of Jacob.

Sir 48:1 1 Blessed, those who will see you, and those who have fallen asleep in love; for we too shall certainly
have life.

Sir 48:12 Such was Elijah, who was enveloped in a whirlwind; and Elisha was filled with his spirit; throughout his
life no ruler could shake him, and no one could subdue him.

Sir 48:13 No task was too hard for him, and even in death his body prophesied.

Sir 48:14 In his lifetime he performed wonders, and in death his works were marvellous.

Sir 48:15 Despite all this the people did not repent, nor did they give up their sins, until they were herded out of
their country and scattered all over the earth;

Sir 48:16 only a few of the people were left, with a ruler of the House of David. Some of them did what pleased
the Lord, others piled sin on sin.

Sir 48:17 Hezekiah fortified his city, and laid on a water-supply inside it; with iron he tunnelled through the rock
and constructed storage-tanks.

Sir 48:18 In his days Sennacherib invaded and sent Rabshakeh; he lifted his hand against Zion, and boasted
loudly in his arrogance.

Sir 48:19 Then their hearts and hands trembled, they felt the pangs of a woman in labour,

Sir 48:20 but they called on the merciful Lord, stretching out their hands towards him. Swiftly the Holy One
heard them from heaven and delivered them by the agency of Isaiah;

Sir 48:21 he struck the camp of the Assyrians and his Angel annihilated them.

Sir 48:22 For Hezekiah did what is pleasing to the Lord, and was steadfast in the ways of David his father,

enjoined on him by the prophet Isaiah, a great man trustworthy in his vision.

Sir 48:23 In his days the sun moved back; he prolonged the life of the king.

Sir 48:24 In the power of the spirit he saw the last things, he comforted the mourners of Zion,

Sir 48:25 he revealed the future to the end of time, and hidden things long before they happened.

Sir 49:1 The memory of Josiah is like blended incense prepared by the perfumer’s art; it is as sweet as honey to
all mouths, and like music at a wine feast.

Sir 49:2 He took the right course, of converting the people, he rooted out the iniquitous abominations,

Sir 49:3 he set his heart on the Lord, in godless times he upheld the cause of religion.

Sir 49:4 Apart from David, Hezekiah and Josiah, they all heaped wrong on wrong, they abandoned the Law of

the Most High: the kings of Judah disappeared;

Sir 49:5 for they handed their power over to others and their honour to a foreign nation.

Sir 49:6 The holy, chosen city was burnt down, her streets were left deserted,

Sir 49:7 as Jeremiah had predicted; for they had ill-treated him, though consecrated a prophet in his mother’s
womb, to tear up and afflict and destroy, but also to build up and to plant.

Sir 49:8 Ezekiel saw a vision of glory which God showed to him above the chariot of the great winged creatures,

Sir 49:9 for he mentioned the enemies in the downpour to the advantage of those who follow the right way.

Sir 49:10 As for the twelve prophets, may their bones flower again from the tomb, since they have comforted
Jacob and redeemed him in faith and hope.

Sir 49:1 1 How shall we extol Zerubbabel? He was like a signet ring on the right hand,

Sir 49:12 so too was Joshua son of Jozadak; they who in their days built the Temple and raised a sanctuary
sacred to the Lord, destined to everlasting glory.

Sir 49:13 Great too is the memory of Nehemiah, who rebuilt our walls which lay in ruins, erected the bolted
gates and rebuilt our houses.

Sir 49:14 No one else has ever been created on earth to equal Enoch, for he was taken up from earth.

Sir 49:15 And no one else ever born has been like Joseph, the leader of his brothers, the prop of his people; his
bones received a visitation.

Sir 49:16 Shem and Seth were the most honoured of men, but above every living creature is Adam.



Sir 50:1 It was the High Priest Simon son of Onias who repaired the Temple during his lifetime and in his day
fortified the sanctuary.

Sir 50:2 He laid the foundations of double depth, the high buttresses of the Temple precincts.

Sir 50:3 In his day the pool was excavated, a reservoir as huge as the sea.

Sir 50:4 Anxious to save the people from ruin, he fortified the city against siege.

Sir 50:5 How splendid he was with the people thronging round him, when he emerged from the curtained shrine,
Sir 50:6 like the morning star among the clouds, like the moon at the full,

Sir 50:7 like the sun shining on the Temple of the Most High, like the rainbow gleaming against brilliant clouds,
Sir 50:8 like a rose in springtime, like a lily by a spring, like a branch of the incense tree in summer,

Sir 50:9 like fire and incense in the censer, like a massive golden vessel encrusted with every kind of precious
stone,

Sir 50:10 like an olive tree loaded with fruit, like a cypress soaring to the clouds;

Sir 50:1 1 when he took his ceremonial robe and put on his magnificent ornaments, when he went up to the holy
altar and filled the sanctuary precincts with his grandeur;

Sir 50:12 when he received the portions from the hands of the priests, himself standing by the altar hearth,
crowned with the circle of his brothers, as a cedar of Lebanon is by its foliage, as though surrounded by the
trunks of palm trees.

Sir 50:13 When all the sons of Aaron in their glory, with the offerings of the Lord in their hands, stood before the
whole assembly of Israel,

Sir 50:14 while he completed the rites at the altars, nobly presenting the offerings to the Almighty, Most High!

Sir 50:15 He would reach out his hand to the cup and pour a libation of wine, pouring it at the foot of the altar, a
fragrance pleasing to the Most High, King of All;

Sir 50:16 then the sons of Aaron would shout and blow their metal trumpets, making a mighty sound ring out as
a reminder before the Most High;

Sir 50:17 and immediately the people all together would fall on their faces to the ground, in adoration of their
Lord, the Almighty, God Most High,

Sir 50:18 and with the cantors chanting their hymns of praise. Sweet was the melody of all these voices,

Sir 50:19 as the people pleaded with the Lord Most High and prayed in the presence of the Merciful, until the
service of the Lord was completed and the ceremony at an end.

Sir 50:20 Then he would come down and raise his hands over the whole assembly of the Israelites, to give them
the Lord’s blessing from his lips, being privileged to pronounce his name;

Sir 50:21 and once again the people would bow low to receive the blessing of the Most High.

Sir 50:22 And now bless the God of all things, the doer of great deeds everywhere, who has exalted our days
from the womb and has acted mercifully towards us.

Sir 50:23 May he grant us cheerful hearts and bring peace in our time, in Israel for ages on ages.

Sir 50:24 May his mercy be faithfully with us, may he redeem us in our own times!

Sir 50:25 There are two nations that my soul detests, the third is not a nation at all:

Sir 50:26 the inhabitants of Mount Seir, the Philistines, and the stupid people living at Shechem.

Sir 50:27 Instruction in wisdom and knowledge is what has been written in this book by Jesus son of Sira
Eleazar of Jerusalem, who has poured a rain of wisdom from his heart.

Sir 50:28 Blessed is he who devotes his time to these and grows wise by taking them to heart!

Sir 50:29 If he practises them he will be strong enough for anything, since the light of the Lord is his path.

Sir 51:1 I shall give thanks to you, Lord and King, and praise you, God my Saviour, I give thanks to your name;
Sir 51 :2 for you have been my guard and support and redeemed my body from destruction, from the snare of
the lying tongue, from lips that fabricate falsehood; in the presence of my assailants, you were on my side; you
have been my support, you have redeemed me,

Sir 51 :3 true to your abounding kindness — and the greatness of your name — you liberated me from the fangs
of those seeking to devour me, from the clutches of those seeking my life, from the many ordeals which I have
endured,

Sir 51 :4 from the stifling heat which hemmed me in, from the heart of a fire which I had not kindled,

Sir 51 :5 from deep in the belly of Sheol,

Sir 51 :6 treacherous denunciations to the king. My soul has been close to death, my life had gone down to the
brink of Sheol.

Sir 51 :7 I was completely surrounded, there was no one to help me; I looked for someöne to help me, there was
no one.

Sir 51 :8 Then I remembered your mercy, Lord, and your deeds from earliest times, how you deliver those who
wait for you patiently, and save them from the clutches of their enemies.

Sir 51 :9 And I sent up my plea from the earth, I begged to be delivered from death.

Sir 51:10 I called on the Lord, the father of my Lord, “Do not desert me in the days of ordeal, in the days of the



proud, when we are helpless. I shall praise your name unceasingly and gratefully sing its praises”.

Sir 51:11 And my plea was heard, for you saved me from destruction, you delivered me from that time of evil.

Sir 51:12 And therefore I shall thank you and praise you, and bless the name of the Lord.

Sir 51:13 When I was still a youth, before I went travelling, in my prayers I asked outright for wisdom.

Sir 51:14 Outside the sanctuary I would pray for her, and to the last I shall continue to seek her.

Sir 51:15 From her blossoming to the ripening of her grape my heart has taken its delight in her. My foot has
pursued a straight path, I have sought her ever since my youth.

Sir 51:16 By bowing my ear a little, I have received her, and have found much instruction.

Sir 51:17 Thanks to her I have advanced; glory be to him who has given me wisdom!

Sir 51:18 For I was determined to put her into practice, have earnestly pursued the good, and shall not be put to
shame.

Sir 51:19 My soul has fought to possess her, I have been scrupulous in keeping the Law; I have stretched out
my hands to heaven and bewailed how little I knew of her;

Sir 51 :20 I have directed my soul towards her, and in purity I have found her; having my heart fixed on her from
the outset, I shall never be deserted;

Sir 51 :21 my very core having yearned to discover her, I have now acquired a good possession.

Sir 51 :22 In reward the Lord has given me a tongue with which I shall sing his praises.

Sir 51 :23 Come close to me, you ignorant, take your place in my school.

Sir 51 :24 Why complain about lacking these things when your souls are so thirsty for them?

Sir 51 :25 I have opened my mouth, I have said: “Buy her without money,

Sir 51 :26 put your necks under her yoke, let your souls receive instruction, she is near, within your reach”.

Sir 51 :27 See for yourselves: how slight my efforts have been to win so much peace.

Sir 51 :28 Buy instruction with a large sum of silver, thanks to her you will gain much gold.

Sir 51 :29 May your souls rejoice in the mercy of the Lord, may you never be ashamed of praising him.

Sir 51 :30 Do your work before the appointed time and at the appointed time he will give you your reward.
