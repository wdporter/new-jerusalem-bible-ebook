<h3>Translator’s Foreword</h3>

<p>The Law, the Prophets, and the other writers succeeding them have passed on to us great lessons, in consequence of which Israel must be commended for learning and wisdom. Furthermore, it is a duty, not only to acquire learning by reading, but also, once having acquired it, to make oneself of use to people outside by what one can say or write. My grandfather Jesus, having long devoted himself to the reading of the Law, the Prophets and other books of the Fathers and having become very learned in them, himself decided to write something on the subjects of learning and wisdom, so that people who wanted to learn might, by themselves accepting these disciplines, learn how better to live according to the Law.</p>

<p>You are therefore asked to read this book with good will and attention and to show indulgence in those places where, notwithstanding our efforts at interpretation, we may seem to have failed to give an adequate rendering of this or that expression;the fact is that there is no equivalent for things originally written in Hebrew when it is a question of translating them into another language;what is more, the Law itself, the Prophets and the other books differ considerably in translation from what appears in the original text.</p>

<p>It was in the thirty-eighth year of the late King Euergetes that, coming to Egypt and spending some time here, and finding life here consistent with a high degree of wisdom, I became convinced of an immediate duty to apply myself in my turn with pains and diligence to the translation of the book that follows;and I spent much time and learning on it in the course of this period, to complete the work and to publish the book for the benefit of those too who, domiciled abroad, wish to study, to reform their behaviour, and to live as the Law requires.</p>

<h2 id="i">I: A Collection of Maxims (1:1–42:14)</h2>

<h4>The origin of wisdom (1:1–10)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>All wisdom comes from the Lord,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">she is with him for ever.</span><br />
	<span>The sands of the sea, the drops of rain,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the days of eternity — who can count them?</span><br />
	<span>The height of the sky, the breadth of the earth,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the depth of the abyss — who can explore them?</span><br />
	<span>Wisdom was created before everything,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">prudent understanding subsists from remotest ages.</span><br />
	<span>For whom has the root of wisdom ever been uncovered?</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Her resourceful ways, who knows them?</span><br />
	<span>One only is wise, terrible indeed,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">seated on his throne, the Lord.</span><br />
	<span>It was he who created, inspected and weighed her up,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and then poured her out on all his works —</span><br />
	<span>as much to each living creature as he chose —</span><br />
	<span class="i1">bestowing her on those who love him.</span>
</p>

<h4>The fear of God (1:11–20)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The fear of the Lord is glory and pride,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">happiness and a crown of joyfulness.</span><br />
	<span>The fear of the Lord gladdens the heart,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">giving happiness, joy and long life.</span><br />
	<span>For those who fear the Lord, all will end well:</span><br />
	<span class="i1">on their dying day they will be blessed.</span><br />
	<span>The basis of wisdom is to fear the Lord;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">she was created with the faithful in their mothers’ womb;</span><br />
	<span>she has made a home in the human race, an age-old foundation,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and to their descendants will she faithfully cling.</span><br />
	<span>The fullness of wisdom is to fear the Lord;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">she intoxicates them with her fruits;</span><br />
	<span>she fills their entire house with treasures</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and their storerooms with her produce.</span><br />
	<span>The crown of wisdom is to fear the Lord:</span><br />
	<span class="i1">she makes peace and health flourish.</span><br />
	<span>The Lord has seen and assessed her,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he has showered down knowledge and intelligence,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he has exalted the renown of those who possess her.</span><br />
	<span>The root of wisdom is to fear the Lord,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and her branches are long life.</span>
</p>

<h4>Patience and self-control (1:22–24)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The rage of the wicked cannot put him in the right,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for the weight of his rage is his downfall.</span><br />
	<span>A patient person puts up with things until the right time comes:</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but his joy will break out in the end.</span><br />
	<span>Until the time comes he keeps his thoughts to himself,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and many a lip will affirm how wise he is.</span>
</p>

<h4>Wisdom and uprightness (1:25–30)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Wisdom’s treasuries contain the maxims of knowledge,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the sinner, however, holds piety in abhorrence.</span><br />
	<span>If you desire wisdom, keep the commandments,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the Lord will bestow it on you.</span><br />
	<span>For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and instruction,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and what pleases him is faithfulness and gentleness.</span><br />
	<span>Do not stand out against fear of the Lord,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not practise it with a double heart.</span><br />
	<span>Do not act a part in public,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">keep watch over your lips.</span><br />
	<span>Do not grow too high and mighty, for fear you fall</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and cover yourself in disgrace;</span><br />
	<span>for the Lord would then reveal your secrets</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and overthrow you before the whole community</span><br />
	<span>for not having practised fear of the Lord</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and for having a heart full of deceit.</span>
</p>

<h4>The fear of God in time of ordeal (2:1–18)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>My child, if you aspire to serve the Lord,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">prepare yourself for an ordeal.</span><br />
	<span>Be sincere of heart, be steadfast,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and do not be alarmed when disaster comes.</span><br />
	<span>Cling to him and do not leave him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">so that you may be honoured at the end of your days.</span><br />
	<span>Whatever happens to you, accept it,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and in the uncertainties of your humble state, be patient,</span><br />
	<span>since gold is tested in the fire,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the chosen in the furnace of humiliation.</span><br />
	<span>Trust him and he will uphold you,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">follow a straight path and hope in him.</span><br />
	<span>You who fear the Lord, wait for his mercy;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not turn aside, for fear you fall.</span><br />
	<span>You who fear the Lord, trust him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and you will not be robbed of your reward.</span><br />
	<span>You who fear the Lord, hope for those good gifts of his,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">everlasting joy and mercy.</span><br />
	<span>Look at the generations of old and see:</span><br />
	<span class="i1">who ever trusted in the Lord and was put to shame?</span><br />
	<span>Or who ever, steadfastly fearing him, was forsaken?</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Or who ever called to him and was ignored?</span><br />
	<span>For the Lord is compassionate and merciful,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he forgives sins and saves in the time of distress.</span><br />
	<span>Woe to faint hearts and listless hands,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and to the sinner who treads two paths.</span><br />
	<span>Woe to the listless heart that has no faith,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for such will have no protection.</span><br />
	<span>Woe to you who have lost the strength to endure;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">what will you do at the Lord’s visitation?</span><br />
	<span>Those who fear the Lord do not disdain his words,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and those who love him keep his ways.</span><br />
	<span>Those who fear the Lord do their best to please him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and those who love him will find satisfaction in the Law.</span><br />
	<span>Those who fear the Lord keep their hearts prepared</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and humble themselves in his presence.</span><br />
	<span>Let us fall into the hands of the Lord, not into any human clutches;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for as his majesty is, so too is his mercy.</span>
</p>

<h4>Duties toward parents (3:1–16)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Children, listen to me for I am your father:</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do what I tell you, and so be safe;</span><br />
	<span>for the Lord honours the father above his children</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and upholds the rights of a mother over her sons.</span><br />
	<span>Whoëver respects a father expiates sins,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">whoëver honours a mother is like someöne amassing a fortune.</span><br />
	<span>Whoëver respects a father will in turn be happy with children,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the day he prays for help, he will be heard.</span><br />
	<span>Long life comes to anyone who honours a father,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">whoëver obeys the Lord makes a mother happy.</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Such a one serves parents as well as the Lord.</span><br />
	<span>Respect your father in deed as well as word,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">so that blessing may come on you from him;</span><br />
	<span>since a father’s blessing makes his children’s house firm,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">while a mother’s curse tears up its foundations.</span><br />
	<span>Do not make a boast of disgrace overtaking your father,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">your father’s disgrace reflects no honour on you;</span><br />
	<span>for a person’s own honour derives from the respect shown to his father,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and a mother held in dishonour is a reproach to her children.</span><br />
	<span>My child, support your father in his old age,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not grieve him during his life.</span><br />
	<span>Even if his mind should fail, show him sympathy,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not despise him in your health and strength;</span><br />
	<span>for kindness to a father will not be forgotten</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but will serve as reparation for your sins.</span><br />
	<span>On your own day of ordeal God will remember you:</span><br />
	<span class="i1">like frost in sunshine, your sins will melt away.</span><br />
	<span>Whoëver deserts a father is no better than a blasphemer,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and whoëver distresses a mother is accursed of the Lord.</span>
</p>

<h4>Humility (3:17–24)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>My child, be gentle in carrying out your business,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and you will be better loved than a lavish giver.</span><br />
	<span>The greater you are, the more humbly you should behave,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and then you will find favour with the Lord;</span><br />
	<span>for great though the power of the Lord is,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he accepts the homage of the humble.</span><br />
	<span>Do not try to understand things that are too difficult for you,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">or try to discover what is beyond your powers.</span><br />
	<span>Concentrate on what has been assigned you,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">you have no need to worry over mysteries.</span><br />
	<span>Do not meddle with matters that are beyond you;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">what you have been taught already exceeds the scope of the human mind.</span><br />
	<span>For many have been misled by their own notions,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">wicked presumption having warped their judgement.</span>
</p>

<h4>Pride (3:26–29)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>A stubborn heart will come to a bad end,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and whoëver dallies with danger will perish in it.</span><br />
	<span>A stubborn heart is weighed down with troubles,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the sinner heaps sin on sin.</span><br />
	<span>For the disease of the proud there is no cure,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">since an evil growth has taken root there.</span><br />
	<span>The heart of the sensible will reflect on parables,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">an attentive ear is the sage’s dream.</span>
</p>

<h4>Charity to the poor (3:30–4:10)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Water puts out a blazing fire,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">almsgiving expiates sins.</span><br />
	<span>Whoëver gives favours in return is mindful of the future;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">at the moment of falling, such a person will find support.</span><br />
	<span>My child, do not refuse the poor a livelihood,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not tantalise the needy.</span><br />
	<span>Do not add to the sufferings of the hungry,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not bait anyone in distress.</span><br />
	<span>Do not aggravate a heart already angry,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">nor keep the destitute waiting for your alms.</span><br />
	<span>Do not repulse a hard-pressed beggar,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">nor turn your face from the poor.</span><br />
	<span>Do not avert your eyes from the needy,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">give no one occasion to curse you;</span><br />
	<span>for if someöne curses you in distress,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">his Maker will give ear to the imprecation.</span><br />
	<span>Gain the love of the community,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">in the presence of the great bow your head.</span><br />
	<span>To the poor lend an ear,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and courteously return the greeting.</span><br />
	<span>Save the oppressed from the hand of the oppressor,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and do not be mean-spirited in your judgements.</span><br />
	<span>Be like a father to the fatherless</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and as good as a husband to their mothers.</span><br />
	<span>And you will be like a child to the Most High,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">who will love you more than your own mother does.</span>
</p>

<h4>Wisdom as educator (4:11–19)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Wisdom brings up her own children</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and cares for those who seek her.</span><br />
	<span>Whoëver loves her loves life,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">those who seek her early will be filled with joy.</span><br />
	<span>Whoëver possesses her will inherit honour,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and wherever he walks the Lord will bless him.</span><br />
	<span>Those who serve her minister to the Holy One,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the Lord loves those who love her.</span><br />
	<span>Whoëver obeys her rules the nations,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">whoëver pays attention to her dwells secure.</span><br />
	<span>If he trusts himself to her he will inherit her,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and his descendants will remain in possession of her;</span><br />
	<span>for though she takes him at first through winding ways,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">bringing fear and faintness on him,</span><br />
	<span>trying him out with her discipline until she can trust him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and testing him with her ordeals,</span><br />
	<span>she then comes back to him on the straight road,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">makes him happy and reveals her secrets to him.</span><br />
	<span>If he goes astray, however, she abandons him</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and leaves him to his own destruction.</span>
</p>

<h4>Modesty and deference to others (4:20–31)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Take circumstances into account and beware of evil,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and have no cause to be ashamed of yourself;</span><br />
	<span>for there is a shame that leads to sin</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and a shame that is honourable and gracious.</span><br />
	<span>Do not be too severe on yourself,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not let shame lead you to ruin.</span><br />
	<span>Do not refrain from speaking when it will do good,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and do not hide your wisdom;</span><br />
	<span>for your wisdom is made known by what you say,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">your erudition by the words you utter.</span><br />
	<span>Do not contradict the truth,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">rather blush for your own ignorance.</span><br />
	<span>Do not be ashamed to confess your sins,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not struggle against the current of the river.</span><br />
	<span>Do not grovel to the foolish,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not show partiality to the influential.</span><br />
	<span>Fight to the death for truth,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the Lord God will war on your side.</span><br />
	<span>Do not be bold of tongue,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">yet idle and slack in deed;</span><br />
	<span>do not be like a lion at home,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">or cowardly towards your servants.</span><br />
	<span>Do not let your hands be outstretched to receive,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">yet tight-fisted when the time comes to give back.</span>
</p>

<h4>Wealth and presumption (5:1–8)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not put your confidence in your money</span><br />
	<span class="i1">or say, “With this I am self-sufficient”.</span><br />
	<span>Do not be led by your appetites and energy</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to follow the passions of your heart.</span><br />
	<span>And do not say, “Who has authority over me?”,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for the Lord will certainly give you your deserts.</span><br />
	<span>Do not say, “I have sinned, but what harm has befallen me?”,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for the Lord’s forbearance is long.</span><br />
	<span>Do not be so sure of forgiveness</span><br />
	<span class="i1">that you add sin to sin.</span><br />
	<span>And do not say, “His compassion is great,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he will forgive me my many sins”;</span><br />
	<span>for with him are both mercy and retribution,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and his anger does not pass from sinners.</span><br />
	<span>Do not delay your return to the Lord,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not put it off day after day;</span><br />
	<span>for suddenly the Lord’s wrath will blaze out,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and on the day of punishment you will be utterly destroyed.</span><br />
	<span>Do not set your heart on ill-gotten gains,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">they will be of no use to you on the day of disaster.</span>
</p>

<h4>Straightforwardness and self-possession (5:9–6:4)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not winnow in every wind,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">or walk along every by-way</span><br />
	<span class="i1">(as the double-talking sinner does).</span><br />
	<span>Be steady in your convictions,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and be a person of your word.</span><br />
	<span>Be quick to listen,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and deliberate in giving an answer.</span><br />
	<span>If you understand the matter, give your neighbour an answer,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">if not, keep your hand over your mouth.</span><br />
	<span>Both honour and disgrace come from talking,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the tongue is its owner’s downfall.</span><br />
	<span>Do not get a name for scandal-mongering,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not set traps with your tongue;</span><br />
	<span>for as shame lies in store for the thief,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">so harsh condemnation awaits the deceitful.</span><br />
	<span>Avoid offences in great as in small matters,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and do not exchange friendship for enmity,</span><br />
	<span>for a bad name will earn you shame and reproach,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">as happens to the double-talking sinner.</span><br />
	<span>Do not get carried aloft on the wings of passion,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for fear your strength tear itself apart like a bull,</span><br />
	<span>and you devour your own foliage and destroy your own fruit</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and end by making yourself like a piece of dried-up wood.</span><br />
	<span>An evil temper destroys the person who has it</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and makes him the laughing-stock of his enemies.</span>
</p>

<h4>Friendship (6:5–17)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>A kindly turn of speech attracts new friends,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">a courteous tongue invites many a friendly response.</span><br />
	<span>Let your acquaintances be many,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but for advisers choose one out of a thousand.</span><br />
	<span>If you want to make a friend, take him on trial,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and do not be in a hurry to trust him;</span><br />
	<span>for one kind of friend is so only when it suits him</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but will not stand by you in your day of trouble.</span><br />
	<span>Another kind of friend will fall out with you</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and to your dismay make your quarrel public,</span><br />
	<span>and a third kind of friend will share your table,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but not stand by you in your day of trouble:</span><br />
	<span>when you are doing well he will be your second self,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">ordering your servants about;</span><br />
	<span>but, if disaster befalls you, he will recoil from you</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and keep out of your way.</span><br />
	<span>Keep well clear of your enemies,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and be wary of your friends.</span><br />
	<span>A loyal friend is a powerful defence:</span><br />
	<span class="i1">whoëver finds one has indeed found a treasure.</span><br />
	<span>A loyal friend is something beyond price,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">there is no measuring his worth.</span><br />
	<span>A loyal friend is the elixir of life,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and those who fear the Lord will find one.</span><br />
	<span>Whoëver fears the Lord makes true friends,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for as a person is, so is his friend too.</span>
</p>

<h4>Apprenticeship to wisdom (6:18–37)</h4>
<p class="poem">
	<span>My child, from your earliest youth choose instruction,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and until your hair is white you will keep finding wisdom.</span><br />
	<span>Like ploughman and sower, cultivate her</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and wait for her fine harvest,</span><br />
	<span>for in tilling her you will toil a little while,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but very soon you will be eating her crops.</span><br />
	<span>How very harsh she is to the undisciplined! </span><br />
	<span class="i1">The senseless does not stay with her for long:</span><br />
	<span>she will weigh as heavily on the senseless as a touchstone</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and such a person will lose no time in throwing her off;</span><br />
	<span>for Wisdom is true to her name,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">she is not accessible to many.</span><br />
	<span>Listen, my child, and take my advice,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not reject my counsel:</span><br />
	<span>put your feet into her fetters,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and your neck into her collar;</span><br />
	<span>offer your shoulder to her burden,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not be impatient of her bonds;</span><br />
	<span>court her with all your soul,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and with all your might keep in her ways;</span><br />
	<span>search for her, track her down: she will reveal herself;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">once you hold her, do not let her go.</span><br />
	<span>For in the end you will find rest in her</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and she will take the form of joy for you:</span><br />
	<span>her fetters you will find a mighty defence,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">her collars, a precious necklace.</span><br />
	<span>Her yoke will be a golden ornament,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and her bonds be purple ribbons;</span><br />
	<span>you will wear her like a robe of honour,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">you will put her on like a crown of joy.</span><br />
	<span>If you wish it, my child, you can be taught;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">apply yourself, and you will become intelligent.</span><br />
	<span>If you love listening, you will learn,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">if you pay attention, you will become wise.</span><br />
	<span>Attend the gathering of elders;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">if there is a wise man there, attach yourself to him.</span><br />
	<span>Listen willingly to any discourse coming from God,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not let wise proverbs escape you.</span><br />
	<span>If you see a man of understanding, visit him early,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">let your feet wear out his doorstep.</span><br />
	<span>Reflect on the injunctions of the Lord,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">busy yourself at all times with his commandments.</span><br />
	<span>He will strengthen your mind,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the wisdom you desire will be granted you.</span>
</p>

<h4>Miscellaneous advice (7:1–21)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do no evil, and evil will not befall you;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">shun wrong, and it will avoid you.</span><br />
	<span>My child, do not sow in the furrows of wickedness,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for fear you have to reap them seven times over.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not ask the Lord for the highest place,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">or the king for a seat of honour.</span><br />
	<span>Do not parade your uprightness before the Lord,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">or your wisdom before the king.</span><br />
	<span>Do not scheme to be appointed judge,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for fear you should not be strong enough to stamp out injustice,</span><br />
	<span>for fear of being swayed by someöne influential</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and so of risking the loss of your integrity.</span><br />
	<span>Do not wrong the general body of citizens</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and so lower yourself in popular esteem.</span><br />
	<span>Do not be drawn to sin twice over,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for you will not go unpunished even once.</span><br />
	<span>Do not say, “God will be impressed by my numerous offerings;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">when I sacrifice to God Most High, he is bound to accept”.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not be hesitant in prayer;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not neglect to give alms.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not laugh at someöne who is sad of heart,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for he who brings low can lift up high.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not make up lies against your brother,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">nor against a friend either.</span><br />
	<span>Mind you tell no lies,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for no good can come of it.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not talk too much at the gathering of elders,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and do not repeat yourself at your prayers.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not shirk tiring jobs or farm work,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">ordained by the Most High.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not swell the ranks of sinners,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">remember that the retribution will not delay.</span><br />
	<span>Be very humble,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">since the recompense for the godless is fire and worms.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not barter a friend away for the sake of profit,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">nor a true brother for the gold of Ophir.</span><br />
	<span>Do not turn against a wise and good wife;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">her gracious presence is worth more than gold.</span><br />
	<span>Do not ill-treat a slave who is an honest worker,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">or a wage-earner who is devoted to you.</span><br />
	<span>Love an intelligent slave with all your heart,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and do not deny such a slave his freedom.</span>
</p>

<h4>Children (7:22–26)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Have you cattle? Look after them;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">if they are making you a profit, keep them.</span><br />
	<span>Have you children? Educate them,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">from childhood make them bow the neck.</span><br />
	<span>Have you daughters? Take care of their bodies,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but do not be over-indulgent.</span><br />
	<span>Marry a daughter off, and you have finished a great work;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but give her to a man of sense.</span><br />
	<span>Have you a wife to your liking? Do not turn her out;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but if you do not love her, never trust her.</span>
</p>

<h4>Parents (7:27–28)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>With all your heart honour your father,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">never forget the birthpangs of your mother.</span><br />
	<span>Remember that you owe your birth to them;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">how can you repay them for what they have done for you?</span>
</p>

<h4>Priests (7:29–31)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>With all your soul, fear the Lord</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and revere his priests.</span><br />
	<span>With all your might love him who made you, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and do not abandon his ministers.</span><br />
	<span>Fear the Lord and honour the priest</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and give him the portion enjoined on you:</span><br />
	<span>first-fruits, sacrifice of reparation, shoulder-gift,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">sanctification sacrifice, first-fruits of the holy things.</span>
</p>

<h4>The poor and afflicted (7:32–36)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>And also give generously to the poor,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">so that your blessing may lack nothing.</span><br />
	<span>Let your generosity extend to all the living,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not withhold it even from the dead.</span><br />
	<span>Do not turn your back on those who weep,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but share the grief of the grief-stricken.</span><br />
	<span>Do not shrink from visiting the sick;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">in this way you will make yourself loved.</span><br />
	<span>In everything you do, remember your end,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and you will never sin.</span>
</p>

<h4>Prudence and common sense (8:1–7)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not try conclusions with anyone influential,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">in case you later fall into his clutches.</span><br />
	<span>Do not quarrel with anyone rich,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">in case he puts his weight against you;</span><br />
	<span>for gold has destroyed many,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and has swayed the hearts of kings.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not argue with anyone argumentative,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not pile wood on that fire.</span><br />
	<span>Do not joke with anyone uncouth,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for fear of hearing your ancestors insulted.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not revile a repentant sinner;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">remember that we all are guilty.</span><br />
	<span>Do not despise anyone in old age;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">after all, some of us too are growing old.</span><br />
	<span>Do not gloat over anyone’s death;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">remember that we all have to die.</span>
</p>

<h4>Tradition (8:8–9)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not scorn the discourse of the wise,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but make yourself familiar with their maxims,</span><br />
	<span>since from these you will learn the theory</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the art of serving the great.</span><br />
	<span>Do not dismiss what the old people have to say,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for they too were taught by their parents;</span><br />
	<span>from them you will learn how to think,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the art of the timely answer.</span>
</p>

<h4>Prudence (8:10–19)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not kindle the coals of the sinner,</span><br />
	<span>in case you scorch yourself in his blaze.</span><br />
	<span>Refuse to be provoked by the insolent,</span><br />
	<span>for fear that such a one try to trap you in your words.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not lend to anyone who is stronger than you are —</span><br />
	<span class="i1">if you do lend, resign yourself to loss.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not stand surety beyond your means;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">if you do stand surety, be prepared to pay up.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not go to law with a judge,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">since judgement will be given in his favour.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not go travelling with a rash man,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for fear he becomes burdensome to you;</span><br />
	<span>he will act as the whim takes him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and you will both be ruined by his folly.</span><br />
	<span>Do not argue with a quick-tempered man,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not go with him where there are no other people,</span><br />
	<span>since blood counts for nothing in his eyes,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and where no help is to be had, he will strike you down.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not ask a fool for advice,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">since a fool will not be able to keep a confidence.</span><br />
	<span>In a stranger’s presence do nothing that should be kept secret,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">since you cannot tell what use the stranger will make of it.</span><br />
	<span>Do not open your heart to all comers,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">nor lay claim to their good offices.</span>
</p>

<h4>Women (9:1–9)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not be jealous of the wife you love,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not teach her lessons in how to harm you.</span><br />
	<span>Do not put yourself in a woman’s hands</span><br />
	<span class="i1">or she may come to dominate you completely.</span><br />
	<span>Do not keep company with a prostitute,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">in case you get entangled in her snares.</span><br />
	<span>Do not dally with a singing girl,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">in case you get caught by her wiles.</span><br />
	<span>Do not stare at a pretty girl,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">in case you and she incur the same punishment.</span><br />
	<span>Do not give your heart to whores,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">or you will ruin your inheritance.</span><br />
	<span>Keep your eyes to yourself in the streets of a town,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not prowl about its unfrequented quarters.</span><br />
	<span>Turn your eyes away from a handsome woman,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not stare at a beauty belonging to someöne else.</span><br />
	<span>Because of a woman’s beauty, many have been undone;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">this makes passion flare up like a fire.</span><br />
	<span>Never sit down with a married woman,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">or sit at table with her drinking wine,</span><br />
	<span>in case you let your heart succumb to her</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and you lose all self-control and slide to disaster.</span>
</p>

<h4>Relations with people (9:10–18)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not desert an old friend;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the new one will not be his match.</span><br />
	<span>New friend, new wine;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">when it grows old, you drink it with pleasure.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not envy the sinner his success;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">you do not know how that will end.</span><br />
	<span>Do not take pleasure in what pleases the godless;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">remember they will not go unpunished here below.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Keep your distance from the man who has the power to put to death,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and you will not be haunted by the fear of dying.</span><br />
	<span>If you do approach him, make no false move,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">or he may take your life.</span><br />
	<span>Realise that you are treading among trip-lines,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">that you are strolling on the battlements.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Cultivate your neighbours to the best of your ability,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and consult with the wise.</span><br />
	<span>For conversation seek the intelligent,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">let all your discussions bear on the law of the Most High.</span><br />
	<span>Have the upright for your table companions,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and let your pride be in fearing the Lord.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Work from skilled hands will earn its praise,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but a leader of the people must be skilful in words.</span><br />
	<span>A chatterbox is a terror to his town,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">a loose talker is detested.</span>
</p>

<h4>Government (10:1–5)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>A sagacious ruler educates his people,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and he makes his subjects understand order.</span><br />
	<span>As the magistrate is, so will his officials be,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">as the governor is, so will be the inhabitants of his city.</span><br />
	<span>An undisciplined king will be the ruin of his people,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">a city owes its prosperity to the intelligence of its leading men.</span><br />
	<span>The government of the earth is in the hands of the Lord,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he sets the right leader over it at the right time.</span><br />
	<span>Human success is in the hands of the Lord.</span><br />
	<span class="i1">He invests the scribe with honour.</span>
</p>

<h4>Against pride (10:6–18)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not resent your neighbour’s every offence,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and never act in a fit of passion.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Pride is hateful to God and humanity,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and injustice is abhorrent to both.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Sovereignty passes from nation to nation</span><br />
	<span class="i1">because of injustice, arrogance and money.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>What has dust and ashes to pride itself on?</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Even in life its entrails are repellent.</span><br />
	<span>A long illness makes a fool of the doctor;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">a king today is a corpse tomorrow.</span><br />
	<span>For in death the portion of all alike will be</span><br />
	<span class="i1">insects, wild animals and worms.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The first stage of pride is to desert the Lord</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and to turn one’s heart away from one’s Maker.</span><br />
	<span>Since the first stage of pride is sin,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">whoëver clings to it will pour forth filth.</span><br />
	<span class="i1">This is why the Lord inflicts unexpected punishments</span><br />
	<span>on such people, utterly destroying them.</span><br />
	<span class="i1">The Lord has turned mighty princes off their thrones</span><br />
	<span>and seated the humble there instead.</span><br />
	<span class="i1">The Lord has plucked up the proud by the roots,</span><br />
	<span>and planted the lowly in their place.</span><br />
	<span class="i1">The Lord has overthrown the lands of the nations</span><br />
	<span>and destroyed them to the very foundations of the earth.</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Sometimes he has taken them away and destroyed them,</span><br />
	<span>and blotted out their memory from the earth.</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Pride was not created for human beings,</span><br />
	<span>nor furious rage for those born of woman.</span>
</p>

<h4>Persons deserving honour (10:19–25)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>What race deserves honour? The human race.</span><br />
	<span class="i1">What race deserves honour? Those who fear the Lord.</span><br />
	<span>What race deserves contempt? The human race.</span><br />
	<span class="i1">What race deserves contempt? Those who break the Law.</span><br />
	<span>A leader is honoured by his brothers,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and those who fear the Lord are honoured by him.</span><br />
	<span>The rich, the noble, the poor,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">let them pride themselves on fearing the Lord.</span><br />
	<span>It is not right to despise one who is poor but intelligent,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and it is not good to honour one who is a sinner.</span><br />
	<span>Magnate, magistrate, potentate, all are to be honoured,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but none is greater than the one who fears the Lord.</span><br />
	<span>A wise slave will have free men waiting on him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the enlightened will not complain.</span>
</p>

<h4>Frankness and humility (10:26–31)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not try to be smart when you do your work,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not put on airs when you are in difficulties.</span><br />
	<span>Better the hardworking who has plenty of everything,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">than the pretentious at a loss for a meal.</span><br />
	<span>My child, be modest in your self-esteem,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and value yourself at your proper worth.</span><br />
	<span>Who can justify one who inflicts injuries on himself,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">or respect one who is full of self-contempt?</span><br />
	<span>The poor is honoured for wit,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the rich for wealth.</span><br />
	<span>Honoured in poverty, how much the more in wealth!</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Dishonoured in wealth, how much the more in poverty!</span>
</p>

<h4>The deceptiveness of appearances (11:1–6)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Wisdom enables the poor to stand erect,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and gives to the poor a place with the great.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not praise anyone for good looks,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">nor dislike anyone for mere appearance.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Small among winged creatures is the bee</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but her produce is the sweetest of the sweet.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not grow proud when people honour you;</span><br />
	<span>for the works of the Lord are wonderful</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but hidden from human beings.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Many monarchs have been made to sit on the ground,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the person nobody thought of has worn the crown.</span><br />
	<span>Many influential people have been utterly disgraced,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and prominent people have fallen into the power of others.</span>
</p>

<h4>Deliberation and reflection (11:7–11)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not find fault before making thorough enquiry;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">first reflect, then give a reprimand.</span><br />
	<span>Listen before you answer,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and do not interrupt a speech before it is finished.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not wrangle about something that does not concern you,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not interfere in the quarrels of sinners.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>My child, do not take on a great amount of business;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">if you multiply your interests, you are bound to suffer for it;</span><br />
	<span>hurry as fast as you can, yet you will never arrive,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">nor will you escape by running away.</span><br />
	<span>Some people work very hard at top speed,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">only to find themselves falling further behind.</span>
</p>

<h4>Trust in God alone (11:12–28)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Or there is the slow kind of person, needing help,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">poor in possessions and rich in poverty;</span><br />
	<span>and the Lord turns a favourable eye on him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">lifts him out of his wretched condition,</span><br />
	<span>and enables him to hold his head high,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">thus causing general astonishment.</span><br />
	<span>Good and bad, life and death,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">poverty and wealth, all come from the Lord.</span><br />
	<span>To the devout the Lord’s gift remains constant,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and his favour will be there to lead them for ever.</span><br />
	<span>Others grow rich by pinching and scraping,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and here is the reward they receive for it:</span><br />
	<span>although they say, “Now I can sit back</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and enjoy the benefit of what I have got”,</span><br />
	<span>they do not know how long this will last;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">they will have to leave their goods to others and die.</span><br />
	<span>Stick to your job, work hard at it</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and grow old at your work.</span><br />
	<span>Do not admire the achievements of sinners,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">trust the Lord and mind your own business;</span><br />
	<span>since it is a trifle in the eyes of the Lord,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">in a moment, suddenly to make the poor rich.</span><br />
	<span>The blessing of the Lord is the reward of the devout,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">in a moment God brings his blessing to flower.</span><br />
	<span>Do not say, “What are my needs,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">how much shall I have in the future?”.</span><br />
	<span>And do not say, “I am self-sufficient,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">what disaster can affect me now?”.</span><br />
	<span>In prosperous times, disasters are forgotten</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and in times of disaster, no one remembers prosperity.</span><br />
	<span>Yet it is a trifle for the Lord on the day someöne dies</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to repay him as his conduct deserves.</span><br />
	<span>A moment’s adversity, and pleasures are forgotten;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">in a person’s last hour his deeds will stand revealed.</span><br />
	<span>Call no one fortunate before his death;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">it is by his end that someöne will be known.</span>
</p>

<h4>Distrust the wicked (11:29–34)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not bring everyone home with you,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for many are the traps of the crafty.</span><br />
	<span>Like a captive partridge in a cage, so is the heart of the proud:</span><br />
	<span class="i1">like a spy he watches for your downfall,</span><br />
	<span>ever on the look-out, turning good into bad</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and finding fault with what is praiseworthy.</span><br />
	<span>A hearthful of glowing coals starts from a single spark,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the sinner lurks for the chance to spill blood.</span><br />
	<span>Beware of a scoundrel and his evil contrivances,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">in case he puts a smear on you for ever.</span><br />
	<span>Give a home to a stranger and he will start trouble</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and estrange you from your own family.</span>
</p>

<h4>Rules for doing good (12:1–7)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>If you mean to do a kindness, choose the right person,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">then your good deeds will not be wasted.</span><br />
	<span>Do good to someöne devout, and you will be rewarded,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">if not by that person, then certainly by the Most High.</span><br />
	<span>No good will come to one who persists in evil,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">or who refuses to give alms.</span><br />
	<span>Give to the devout,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not go to the help of a sinner.</span><br />
	<span>Do good to the humble,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">give nothing to the godless.</span><br />
	<span>Refuse him bread, do not give him any,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">it might make him stronger than you are;</span><br />
	<span>then you would be repaid evil twice over</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for all the good you had done him.</span><br />
	<span>For the Most High himself detests sinners,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and will repay the wicked with what they deserve.</span><br />
	<span>Give to the good,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and do not go to the help of a sinner.</span>
</p>

<h4>True and false friends (12:8–18)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>In prosperity you cannot always tell a true friend,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but in adversity you cannot mistake an enemy.</span><br />
	<span>When someöne is doing well that person’s enemies are sad,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">when someöne is doing badly, even a friend will keep at a distance.</span><br />
	<span>Do not ever trust an enemy;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">as bronze tarnishes, so does an enemy’s malice.</span><br />
	<span>Even if he behaves humbly and comes bowing and scraping,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">maintain your reserve and be on your guard against him.</span><br />
	<span>Behave towards him as if you were polishing a mirror,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">you will find that his tarnish cannot last.</span><br />
	<span>Do not stand him beside you</span><br />
	<span class="i1">in case he thrusts you out and takes your place.</span><br />
	<span>Do not seat him on your right,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">or he will be after your position,</span><br />
	<span>and then you will remember what I have said</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and sadly admit that I was right.</span><br />
	<span>Who feels sorry for a snake-charmer bitten by a snake,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">or for those who take risks with savage animals? —</span><br />
	<span>just so for one who consorts with a sinner,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and becomes an accomplice in his sins.</span><br />
	<span>He will stay with you for a while,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but if you once give way he will press his advantage.</span><br />
	<span>An enemy may have sweetness on his lips,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and in his heart a scheme to throw you into the ditch.</span><br />
	<span>An enemy may have tears in his eyes,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but if he gets a chance there can never be too much blood for him.</span><br />
	<span>If you meet with misfortune, you will find him there before you,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and, pretending to help you, he will trip you up.</span><br />
	<span>He will wag his head and clap his hands,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he will whisper a lot and his expression will change.</span>
</p>

<h4>Mix with your equals (13:1–26)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Whoëver touches pitch will be defiled,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and anyone who associates with the proud will come to be like them.</span><br />
	<span>Do not try to carry a burden too heavy for you,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not associate with someöne more powerful and wealthy than yourself.</span><br />
	<span>Why put the clay pot next to the iron cauldron?</span><br />
	<span class="i1">It will only break when they bang against each other.</span><br />
	<span>The rich does wrong and takes a high line;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the poor is wronged and has to beg for pardon.</span><br />
	<span>If you are useful the rich will exploit you,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">if you go bankrupt he will desert you.</span><br />
	<span>Are you well off? — he will live with you,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he will clean you out without a single qualm.</span><br />
	<span>Does he need you? — he will hoodwink you,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">smile at you and raise your hopes;</span><br />
	<span>he will speak politely to you</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and say, “Is there anything you need?”.</span><br />
	<span>He will make you feel small at his dinner parties</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and, having cleaned you out two or three times over,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">will end by laughing at you.</span><br />
	<span>Afterwards, when he sees you, he will avoid you</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and shake his head about you.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Take care you are not hoodwinked</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and thus humiliated through your own stupidity.</span><br />
	<span>When an influential person invites you, show reluctance,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and he will press his invitation all the more.</span><br />
	<span>Do not thrust yourself forward, in case you are pushed aside,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but do not stand aloof, or you will be overlooked.</span><br />
	<span>Do not affect to treat him as an equal,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not trust his flow of words;</span><br />
	<span>since all this talking is expressly meant to test you,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">under cover of geniality he will be weighing you up.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Pitiless is anyone who retails gossip;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he will not spare you either blows or chains.</span><br />
	<span>Be wary, take very great care,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">because you are walking with your own downfall.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Every living thing loves its own sort,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and every man his fellow.</span><br />
	<span>Every creature mixes with its kind,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and human beings stick to their own sort.</span><br />
	<span>How can wolf and lamb agree? —</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Just so with sinner and devout.</span><br />
	<span>What peace can there be between hyena and dog?</span><br />
	<span class="i1">And what peace between rich and poor?</span><br />
	<span>Wild desert donkeys are the prey of lions;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">so too, the poor is the quarry of the rich.</span><br />
	<span>The proud thinks humility abhorrent;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">so too, the rich abominates the poor.</span><br />
	<span>When the rich stumbles he is supported by friends;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">when the poor falls, his friends push him away.</span><br />
	<span>When the rich slips, there are many hands to catch him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">if he talks nonsense he is congratulated.</span><br />
	<span>The poor slips, and is blamed for it,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he may talk good sense, but no room is made for him.</span><br />
	<span>The rich speaks and everyone stops talking,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and then they praise his discourse to the skies.</span><br />
	<span>The poor speaks and people say, “Who is this?”,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and if he stumbles, they trip him up yet more.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Wealth is good where there is no sin,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">poverty is evil, the godless say.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The heart moulds a person’s expression</span><br />
	<span class="i1">whether for better or worse.</span><br />
	<span>Happy heart, cheerful expression;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but wearisome work, inventing proverbs.</span>
</p>

<h4>True happiness (14:1–2)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Blessed is anyone who has not sinned in speech</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and who needs feel no remorse for sins.</span><br />
	<span>Blessed is anyone whose conscience does not reproach him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and who has never given up hope.</span>
</p>

<h4>Envy and greed (14:3–19)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Wealth is not the right thing for the niggardly,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and what use are possessions to the covetous?</span><br />
	<span>Whoëver hoards by stinting himself is hoarding for others,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and others will live sumptuously on his riches.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>If someöne is mean to himself, whom does he benefit?</span><br />
	<span class="i1">He does not even enjoy what is his own.</span><br />
	<span>No one is meaner than the person who is mean to himself,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">this is how his wickedness repays him.</span><br />
	<span>If he does any good, he does it unintentionally,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and in the end he himself reveals his wickedness.</span><br />
	<span>Wicked the person who has an envious eye,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">averting his face, and careless of others’ lives.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The eye of the grasping is not content with what he has,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">greed shrivels up the soul.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The miser is grudging of bread,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">there is famine at his table.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>My child, treat yourself as well as you can afford,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and bring worthy offerings to the Lord.</span><br />
	<span>Remember that death will not delay,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and that you have never seen Sheol’s contract.</span><br />
	<span>Be kind to your friend before you die,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">treat him as generously as you can afford.</span><br />
	<span>Do not refuse yourself the good things of today,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not let your share of what is lawfully desired pass you by.</span><br />
	<span>Will you not have to leave your fortune to another,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the fruit of your labour to be divided by lot?</span><br />
	<span>Give and receive, enjoy yourself —</span><br />
	<span class="i1">there are no pleasures to be found in Sheol.</span><br />
	<span>Like clothes, every body will wear out,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the age — old law is, “Everyone must die”.</span><br />
	<span>Like foliage growing on a bushy tree,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">some leaves falling, others growing,</span><br />
	<span>so are the generations of flesh and blood:</span><br />
	<span class="i1">one dies, another is born.</span><br />
	<span>Every achievement rots away and perishes,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and with it goes its author.</span>
</p>

<h4>The happiness of the sage (14:20–15:10)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Blessed is anyone who meditates on wisdom,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and reasons with intelligence,</span><br />
	<span>who studies her ways in his heart,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and ponders her secrets.</span><br />
	<span>He pursues her like a hunter,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and lies in wait by her path;</span><br />
	<span>he peeps in at her windows,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and listens at her doors;</span><br />
	<span>he lodges close to her house,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and fixes his peg in her walls;</span><br />
	<span>he pitches his tent at her side,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and lodges in an excellent lodging;</span><br />
	<span>he sets his children in her shade,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and camps beneath her branches;</span><br />
	<span>he is sheltered by her from the heat,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and in her glory he makes his home.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Whoëver fears the Lord will act like this,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and whoëver grasps the Law will obtain wisdom.</span><br />
	<span>She will come to meet him like a mother,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and receive him like a virgin bride.</span><br />
	<span>She will give him the bread of understanding to eat,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the water of wisdom to drink.</span><br />
	<span>He will lean on her and will not fall,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he will rely on her and not be put to shame.</span><br />
	<span>She will raise him high above his neighbours,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and in full assembly she will open his mouth.</span><br />
	<span>He will find happiness and a crown of joy,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he will inherit an everlasting name.</span><br />
	<span>Fools will not gain possession of her,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">nor will sinners set eyes on her.</span><br />
	<span>She stands remote from pride,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and liars cannot call her to mind.</span><br />
	<span>Praise is unseemly in a sinner’s mouth,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">since it has not been put there by the Lord.</span><br />
	<span>For praise should be uttered only in wisdom,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the Lord himself then prompts it.</span>
</p>

<h4>Freedom of choice (15:11–20)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not say, “The Lord was responsible for my sinning”,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for he does not do what he hates.</span><br />
	<span>Do not say, “It was he who led me astray”,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for he has no use for a sinner.</span><br />
	<span>The Lord hates all that is foul,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and no one who fears him will love it either.</span><br />
	<span>He himself made human beings in the beginning,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and then left them free to make their own decisions.</span><br />
	<span>If you choose, you will keep the commandments</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and so be faithful to his will.</span><br />
	<span>He has set fire and water before you;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">put out your hand to whichever you prefer.</span><br />
	<span>A human being has life and death before him;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">whichever he prefers will be given him.</span><br />
	<span>For vast is the wisdom of the Lord;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he is almighty and all-seeing.</span><br />
	<span>His eyes are on those who fear him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he notes every human action.</span><br />
	<span>He never commanded anyone to be godless,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he has given no one permission to sin.</span>
</p>

<h4>The fate of the obstinate (16:1–14)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not long for a brood of worthless children,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and do not take pleasure in godless sons.</span><br />
	<span>However many you have, take no pleasure in them,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">unless the fear of the Lord lives among them.</span><br />
	<span>Do not count on their having long life,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not put too much faith in their number;</span><br />
	<span>for better have one than a thousand,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">better die childless than have children who are godless.</span><br />
	<span>One person of sense can populate a city,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but a race of lawless people will be destroyed.</span><br />
	<span>My eyes have seen many such things,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">my ears have heard things even more impressive.</span><br />
	<span>Fire is kindled in a sinful society,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Retribution blazes in a rebellious nation.</span><br />
	<span>God did not pardon the giants of old</span><br />
	<span class="i1">who, confident in their strength, had rebelled.</span><br />
	<span>He did not spare the people with whom Lot lived;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he abhorred them, rather, for their pride.</span><br />
	<span>He was pitiless to the nation of perdition —</span><br />
	<span class="i1">those people who gloried in their sins —</span><br />
	<span>as also to the six hundred thousand men on the march,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">who had banded together in their obstinacy.</span><br />
	<span>And had there been only one man stubborn,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">it would have been amazing had he escaped unpunished,</span><br />
	<span>since mercy and wrath alike belong to the Lord</span><br />
	<span class="i1">who is mighty to forgive and to pour out wrath.</span><br />
	<span>As great as his mercy, so is his severity;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he judges each person as his deeds deserve:</span><br />
	<span>the sinner will not escape with his ill-gotten gains</span><br />
	<span class="i1">nor the patience of the devout go for nothing.</span><br />
	<span>He takes note of every charitable action,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and everyone is treated as he deserves.</span>
</p>

<h4>Certainty of retribution (16:17–23)</h4>
<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not say, “I shall hide from the Lord;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">who is going to remember me up there?</span><br />
	<span>I shall not be noticed among so many people;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">what am I in the immensity of creation?”.</span><br />
	<span>For see, the sky and the heavens above the sky,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the abyss and the earth shake at his visitation.</span><br />
	<span>The mountains and earth’s foundations alike</span><br />
	<span class="i1">quail and tremble when he looks at them.</span><br />
	<span>But to all this no one gives thought.</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Who keeps his movements in mind?</span><br />
	<span>The storm wind itself is invisible,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and most of what he does goes undetected.</span><br />
	<span>“Who will report whether justice has been done?</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Who will be watching? The covenant is remote!”.</span><br />
	<span>Such are the thoughts of the person of little sense,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">stupid, misguided, cherishing his folly.</span>
</p>

<h4>Human beings in the creation (16:24–17:14)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Listen to me, my child, and learn knowledge,</span><br />
	<span>and give your whole mind to my words.</span><br />
	<span>I shall expound discipline methodically</span><br />
	<span>and proclaim knowledge with precision.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>When God created his works in the beginning,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he assigned them their places as soon as they were made.</span><br />
	<span>He determined his works for all time,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">from their origins to their distant generations.</span><br />
	<span>They know neither hunger nor weariness,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and they never desert their duties.</span><br />
	<span>Not one has ever got in the way of another,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and they will never disobey his word.</span><br />
	<span>And afterwards the Lord looked at the earth,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and filled it with his good things.</span><br />
	<span>He covered its surface with every kind of animal,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and to it they will return.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The Lord fashioned human beings from the earth,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to consign them back to it.</span><br />
	<span>He gave them so many days and so much time,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he gave them authority over everything on earth.</span><br />
	<span>He clothed them in strength, like himself,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and made them in his own image.</span><br />
	<span>He filled all living things with dread of human beings,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">making them masters over beasts and birds.</span><br />
	<span>He made them a tongue, eyes and ears,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and gave them a heart to think with.</span><br />
	<span>He filled them with knowledge and intelligence,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and showed them what was good and what evil.</span><br />
	<span>He put his own light in their hearts</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to show them the magnificence of his works,</span><br />
	<span>so that they would praise his holy name</span><br />
	<span class="i1">as they told of his magnificent works.</span><br />
	<span>He set knowledge before them,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he endowed them with the law of life.</span><br />
	<span>He established an eternal covenant with them,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and revealed his judgements to them.</span><br />
	<span>Their eyes saw the majesty of his glory,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and their ears heard the glory of his voice.</span><br />
	<span>He said to them, “Beware of all wrong-doing”;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he gave each a commandment concerning his neighbour.</span>
</p>

<h4>The divine judge (17:15–24)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Their ways are always under his eye,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">they cannot be hidden from his sight.</span><br />
	<span>Over each nation he has set a governor,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but Israel is the Lord’s own portion.</span><br />
	<span>Their actions are all as plain as the sun to him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and his eyes rest constantly on their conduct.</span><br />
	<span>Their iniquities are not hidden from him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">all their sins are before the Lord.</span><br />
	<span>Almsgiving is like a signet ring to him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he cherishes generosity like the pupil of an eye.</span><br />
	<span>One day he will rise and reward them,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he will repay their deserts on their own heads.</span><br />
	<span>But to those who repent he permits return,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and he encourages those who have lost hope.</span>
</p>

<h4>Exhortation to repentance (17:25–32)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Return to the Lord and renounce your sins,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">plead before his face, stop offending him.</span><br />
	<span>Come back to the Most High, turn away from iniquity</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and hold all that is foul in abhorrence.</span><br />
	<span>Who is going to praise the Most High in Sheol</span><br />
	<span class="i1">if we do not glorify him while we are alive?</span><br />
	<span>The dead can praise no more than those who do not exist,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">only those with life and health can praise the Lord.</span><br />
	<span>How great is the mercy of the Lord,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">his pardon for those who turn to him!</span><br />
	<span>For we cannot have everything,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">human beings are not immortal.</span><br />
	<span>What is brighter than the sun? And yet it fades.</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Flesh and blood think of nothing but evil.</span><br />
	<span>He surveys the armies of the lofty sky,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and all of us are only dust and ashes.</span>
</p>

<h4>The greatness of God (18:1–7)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>He who lives for ever has created the sum of things.</span><br />
	<span class="i1">The Lord alone will be found just.</span><br />
	<span>He has given no one the power to proclaim his works to the end,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and who can fathom his magnificent deeds?</span><br />
	<span>Who can assess his magnificent strength,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and who can go further and tell all of his mercies?</span><br />
	<span>Nothing can be added to them, nothing subtracted,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">it is impossible to fathom the marvels of the Lord.</span><br />
	<span>When someöne finishes he is only beginning,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and when he stops he is as puzzled as ever.</span>
</p>

<h4>The nothingness of human beings (18:8–14)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>What is a human being, what purpose does he serve?</span><br />
	<span class="i1">What is good and what is bad for him?</span><br />
	<span>The length of his life: a hundred years at most.</span><br />
	<span>Like a drop of water from the sea, or a grain of sand,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">such are these few years compared with eternity.</span><br />
	<span>This is why the Lord is patient with them</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and pours out his mercy on them.</span><br />
	<span>He sees and recognises how wretched their end is,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and so he makes his forgiveness the greater.</span><br />
	<span>Human compassion extends to neighbours,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but the Lord’s compassion extends to everyone;</span><br />
	<span>rebuking, correcting and teaching,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">bringing them back as a shepherd brings his flock.</span><br />
	<span>He has compassion on those who accept correction,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and who fervently search for his judgements.</span>
</p>

<h4>The art of giving (18:15–18)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>My child, do not temper your favours with blame</span><br />
	<span class="i1">nor any of your gifts with words that hurt.</span><br />
	<span>Does not dew relieve the heat?</span><br />
	<span class="i1">In the same way a word is worth more than a gift.</span><br />
	<span>Why surely, a word is better than a good present,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but a generous person is ready with both.</span><br />
	<span>A fool will offer nothing but insult,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and a grudging gift makes the eyes smart.</span>
</p>

<h4>Reflection and foresight (18:19–29)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Learn before you speak,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">take care of yourself before you fall ill.</span><br />
	<span>Examine yourself before judgement comes,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and on the day of visitation you will be acquitted.</span><br />
	<span>Humble yourself before you fall ill,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">repent as soon as the sin is committed.</span><br />
	<span>Let nothing prevent your discharging a vow in good time,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and do not wait until death to set matters right.</span><br />
	<span>Prepare yourself before making a vow,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and do not be like someöne who tempts the Lord.</span><br />
	<span>Bear in mind the retribution of the last days,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the time of vengeance when God averts his face.</span><br />
	<span>In a time of plenty remember times of famine,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">think of poverty and want when you are rich.</span><br />
	<span>The time slips by between dawn and dusk,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">everything passes quickly for the Lord.</span><br />
	<span>The wise will be cautious in everything,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">in sinful times will take care not to offend.</span><br />
	<span>Every person of sense recognises wisdom,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and will respect anyone who has found her.</span><br />
	<span>Those who understand sayings have toiled for their wisdom</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and have poured out accurate maxims.</span>
</p>

<h4>Self-control (18:30–19:3)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not be governed by your passions,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">restrain your desires.</span><br />
	<span>If you allow yourself to satisfy your desires,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">this will make you the laughing-stock of your enemies.</span><br />
	<span>Do not indulge in luxurious living,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not get involved in such society.</span><br />
	<span>Do not beggar yourself by banqueting on credit</span><br />
	<span class="i1">when there is nothing in your pocket.</span><br />
	<span>A drunken workman will never grow rich,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and one who makes light of small matters will gradually sink.</span><br />
	<span>Wine and women corrupt intelligent men,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the customer of whores loses all sense of shame.</span><br />
	<span>Grubs and worms will have him as their legacy,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the man who knows no shame will lose his life.</span>
</p>

<h4>Against loose talk (19:4–12)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Being too ready to trust shows shallowness of mind,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and sinning harms the sinner.</span><br />
	<span>Taking pleasure in evil earns condemnation;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">by hating gossip one avoids evil.</span><br />
	<span>Never repeat what you are told</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and you will come to no harm;</span><br />
	<span>whether to friend or foe, do not talk about it,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">unless it would be sinful not to, do not reveal it;</span><br />
	<span>you would be heard out, then mistrusted,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and in due course you would be hated.</span><br />
	<span>Have you heard something? Let it die with you.</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Courage! It will not burst you!</span><br />
	<span>A fool will suffer birthpangs over a piece of news,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">like a woman labouring with child.</span><br />
	<span>Like an arrow stuck in the flesh of the thigh,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">so is a piece of news inside a fool.</span>
</p>

<h4>Do not trust everything you hear (19:13–17)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Question your friend, he may have done nothing at all;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and if he has done anything, he will not do it again.</span><br />
	<span>Question your neighbour, he may have said nothing at all;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and if he has said anything, he will not say it again.</span><br />
	<span>Question your friend, for slander is very common,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not believe all you hear.</span><br />
	<span>People sometimes make a slip, without meaning what they say;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and which of us has never sinned by speech?</span><br />
	<span>Question your neighbour before you threaten him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and defer to the Law of the Most High.</span>
</p>

<h4>True and false wisdom (19:20–30)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Wisdom consists entirely in fearing the Lord,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and wisdom is entirely constituted by the fulfilling of the Law.</span><br />
	<span>Being learned in evil, however, is not wisdom,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">there is no prudence in the advice of sinners.</span><br />
	<span>There is a cleverness that is detestable;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">whoëver has no wisdom is a fool.</span><br />
	<span>Better be short of sense and full of fear,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">than abound in shrewdness and violate the Law.</span><br />
	<span>There is a wickedness which is scrupulous but nonetheless dishonest,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and there are those who misuse kindness to win their case.</span><br />
	<span>There is the person who will walk bowed down with grief,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">when inwardly this is nothing but deceit:</span><br />
	<span>he hides his face and pretends to be deaf,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">if he is not unmasked, he will take advantage of you.</span><br />
	<span>There is the person who is prevented from sinning by lack of strength,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">yet he will do wrong when he gets the chance.</span><br />
	<span>You can tell a person by his appearance,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">you can tell a thinker by the look on his face.</span><br />
	<span>The way a person dresses, the way he laughs,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the way he walks, tell you what he is.</span>
</p>

<h4>Silence and reproach (20:1–8)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>There is the rebuke that is untimely,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and there is the person who keeps quiet, and he is the shrewd one.</span><br />
	<span>But how much better to rebuke than to fume!</span><br />
	<span class="i1">The person who acknowledges a fault wards off punishment.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Like a eunuch trying to take a girl’s virginity</span><br />
	<span class="i1">is someöne who tries to impose justice by force.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>There is the person who keeps quiet and is considered wise,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">another incurs hatred for talking too much.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>There is the person who keeps quiet, not knowing how to answer,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">another keeps quiet, knowing when to speak.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The wise will keep quiet until the right moment,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but a garrulous fool will always misjudge it.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Someöne who talks too much will earn dislike,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and someöne who usurps authority will earn hatred.</span>
</p>

<h4>Paradoxes (20:9–17)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>There is the person who finds misfortune a boon,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the piece of luck that turns to loss.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>There is the gift that affords you no profit,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the gift that repays you double.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>There is the honour that leads to humiliation,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and there are people in a low state who raise their heads.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>There is the person who buys much for little,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">yet pays for it seven times over.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The wise wins love with words,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">while fools may shower favours in vain.</span><br />
	<span>The gift of the stupid will bring you no advantage,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">his eyes look for seven times as much in return.</span><br />
	<span>He gives little and reviles much,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he opens his mouth like the town crier,</span><br />
	<span>he lends today and demands payment tomorrow;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he is a detestable fellow.</span><br />
	<span>The fool will say, “I have no friends,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">I get no gratitude for my good deeds;</span><br />
	<span>those who eat my bread have malicious tongues”.</span><br />
	<span class="i1">How often he will be laughed at, and by how many!</span>
</p>

<h4>Inappropriate talk (20:18–23)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Better a slip on the pavement than a slip of the tongue;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">this is how ruin takes the wicked by surprise.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>A coarse-grained person is like an indiscreet story</span><br />
	<span class="i1">endlessly retold by the ignorant.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>A maxim is rejected when coming from a fool,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">since the fool does not utter it on the apt occasion.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>There is a person who is prevented from sinning by poverty;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">no qualms of conscience disturb that person’s rest.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>There is a person who courts destruction out of false shame,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">courts destruction for the sake of a fool’s opinion.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>There is a person who out of false shame makes promises to a friend,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and so makes an enemy for nothing.</span>
</p>

<h4>Lying (20:24–26)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Lying is an ugly blot on anyone,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and ever on the lips of the undisciplined.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>A thief is preferable to an inveterate liar,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but both are heading for ruin.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Lying is an abominable habit,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the liar’s disgrace lasts for ever.</span>
</p>

<h4>Wisdom (20:27–31)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The wise gains advancement by words,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the shrewd wins favour from the great.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Whoëver tills the soil will have a full harvest,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">whoëver wins favour from the great will secure pardon for offences.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Presents and gifts blind the eyes of the wise</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and stifle rebukes like a muzzle on the mouth.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Wisdom concealed, and treasure undiscovered,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">what use is either of these?</span><br />
	<span>Better one who conceals his folly</span><br />
	<span class="i1">than one who conceals his wisdom.</span>
</p>

<h4>Various sins (21:1–10)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>My child, have you sinned? Do so no more,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and ask forgiveness for your previous faults.</span><br />
	<span>Flee from sin as from a snake,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">if you approach it, it will bite you;</span><br />
	<span>its teeth are lion’s teeth,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">they take human life away.</span><br />
	<span>All law-breaking is like a two-edged sword,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the wounds it inflicts are beyond cure.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Terror and violence make havoc of riches,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">similarly, desolation overtakes the houses of the proud.</span><br />
	<span>A plea from the mouth of the poor goes straight to the ear of God,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">whose judgement comes without delay.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Whoëver resents reproof walks in the sinner’s footsteps;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">whoëver fears the Lord is repentant of heart.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The glib speaker is known far and wide,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but the wary detects every slip.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>To build your house with other people’s money</span><br />
	<span class="i1">is like collecting stones for your own tomb.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>A meeting of the lawless is like a heap of tow:</span><br />
	<span class="i1">they will end in a blazing fire.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The sinner’s road is smoothly paved,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but it ends at the pit of Sheol.</span>
</p>

<h4>The wise and the foolish (21:11–28)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Whoëver keeps the Law will master his instincts;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the fear of the Lord is made perfect in wisdom.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>No one who lacks aptitude can be taught,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but certain aptitudes give rise to bitterness.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The sage’s knowledge is as rich as the abyss</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and his advice is like a living spring.</span><br />
	<span>The heart of a fool is like a broken jar,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">it will not hold any knowledge.</span><br />
	<span>If the educated hears a wise saying,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he praises it and caps it with another;</span><br />
	<span>if a debauchee hears it, he does not like it</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and tosses it behind his back.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The talk of a fool is like a load on a journey,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but it is a pleasure to listen to the intelligent.</span><br />
	<span>The utterance of the shrewd will be eagerly awaited in the assembly,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">what he says will be given serious consideration.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The wisdom of a fool is like the wreckage of a house,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the knowledge of a dolt is incoherent talk.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>To the senseless fellow instruction is like fetters on the feet,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">like manacles on the right hand.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>A fool laughs at the top of his voice,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but the intelligent quietly smiles.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>To the shrewd instruction is like a golden ornament,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">like a bracelet on the right arm.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The step of a fool goes straight into a house,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but a person of much experience makes a respectful approach;</span><br />
	<span>the stupid peeps inside through the door,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">a well-bred person waits outside.</span><br />
	<span>Listening at doors is a sign of bad upbringing,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the perceptive would be ashamed to do so.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The lips of gossips repeat the words of others,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the words of the wise are carefully weighed.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The heart of fools is in their mouth,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but the mouth of the wise is in their heart.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>When the godless curses Satan,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he is cursing himself.</span><br />
	<span>The scandal-monger sullies himself</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and earns the hatred of the neighbourhood.</span>
</p>

<h4>The idler (22:1–2)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>An idler is like a stone covered in filth,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">everyone whistles at his disgrace.</span><br />
	<span>An idler is like a lump of dung,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">anyone picking it up shakes it off his hand.</span>
</p>

<h4>Degenerate children (22:3–6)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>It is a disgrace to have fathered a badly brought-up son,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but the birth of any daughter is a loss;</span><br />
	<span>a sensible daughter will find a husband,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but a shameless one is a grief to her father.</span><br />
	<span>A brazen daughter puts father and mother to shame,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and will be disowned by both.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>An untimely remonstrance is like music at a funeral,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but a thrashing and correction are wisdom at all times.</span>
</p>

<h4>Wisdom and folly (22:9–18)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Teaching a fool is like gluing bits of pottery together —</span><br />
	<span class="i1">you are rousing someöne who is besotted with sleep.</span><br />
	<span>You might as well talk to someöne sound asleep;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">when you have finished the fool will say, “What’s up?”.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Shed tears for the dead, who has left the light behind;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">shed tears for the fool, who has left his wits behind.</span><br />
	<span>Shed quieter tears for the dead who is at rest,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for the fool life is worse than death.</span><br />
	<span>Mourning for the dead lasts seven days,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for the foolish and ungodly all the days of their lives.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not waste many words on the stupid,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not go near a dolt.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Beware of him, or you will have trouble</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and be soiled by contact with him;</span><br />
	<span>keep away from him, and you will have peace of mind</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and not be exasperated by his folly.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>What is heavier than lead,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and what is its name if not “fool”?</span><br />
	<span>Sand and salt and a lump of iron</span><br />
	<span class="i1">are a lighter burden than a dolt.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>A tie-beam bonded into a building</span><br />
	<span class="i1">will not be dislodged by an earthquake;</span><br />
	<span>so too, a heart resolved after due reflection</span><br />
	<span class="i1">will not flinch at the critical moment.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>A heart founded on intelligent reflection</span><br />
	<span class="i1">is like a stucco decoration on a smooth wall.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Pebbles placed on top of a wall</span><br />
	<span class="i1">will not stand up to the wind;</span><br />
	<span>no more can the heart of a fool frightened at his own thoughts</span><br />
	<span class="i1">stand up to fear.</span>
</p>

<h4>Friendship (22:19–26)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Prick an eye and you will draw a tear,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">prick a heart and you reveal its feelings.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Throw stones at birds and you scare them away,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">reproach a friend and you destroy a friendship.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>If you have drawn your sword on a friend,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not despair; there is a way back.</span><br />
	<span>If you have opened your mouth against your friend,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not worry; there is hope for reconciliation;</span><br />
	<span>but insult, arrogance, betrayal of secrets, and the stab in the back —</span><br />
	<span class="i1">in these cases any friend is lost.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Win your neighbour’s confidence when he is poor,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">so that you may enjoy his later good fortune with him;</span><br />
	<span>stand by him in times of trouble,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">in order to have your share when he comes into a legacy.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Fire is heralded by the reek of the furnace and smoke,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">so too, bloodshed by insults.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>I shall not be ashamed to shelter a friend</span><br />
	<span class="i1">nor shall I hide away from him,</span><br />
	<span>and if evil comes to me through him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">everyone who hears about it will beware of him.</span>
</p>

<h4>Vigilance (22:27–23:6)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Who will set a guard on my mouth,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and an efficient seal on my lips,</span><br />
	<span>to keep me from falling,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and my tongue from causing my ruin?</span><br />
	<span>Lord, father and master of my life,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not abandon me to their whims,</span><br />
	<span>do not let me fall because of them.</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Who will lay whips to my thoughts,</span><br />
	<span>and the discipline of wisdom to my heart,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to be merciless to my errors</span><br />
	<span>and not let my sins go unchecked,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for fear my errors should multiply</span><br />
	<span>and my sins then abound</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and I fall before my adversaries,</span><br />
	<span>and my enemy gloat over me?</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Lord, father and God of my life,</span><br />
	<span>do not let my eyes be proud,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">turn envy away from me,</span><br />
	<span>do not let lechery and lust grip me,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not leave me a prey to shameless desire.</span>
</p>

<h4>Swearing (23:7–11)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Children, listen to what I teach,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">no one who keeps it will be caught out.</span><br />
	<span>The sinner is ensnared by his own lips,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">both the abusive and the proud are tripped by them.</span><br />
	<span>Do not get into the habit of swearing,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not make a habit of naming the Holy One;</span><br />
	<span>for just as a slave who is constantly overseen</span><br />
	<span class="i1">will never be without bruises,</span><br />
	<span>so someöne who is always swearing and uttering the Name</span><br />
	<span class="i1">will not be exempt from sin.</span><br />
	<span>A man for ever swearing is full of iniquity,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the scourge will not depart from his house.</span><br />
	<span>If he offends, his sin will be on him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">if he did it unheedingly, he has doubly sinned;</span><br />
	<span>if he swears a false oath, he will not be treated as innocent,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for his house will be filled with calamities.</span>
</p>

<h4>Foul language (23:12–15)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>One way of talking is like death,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">let it not be found in the heritage of Jacob</span><br />
	<span>since devout people have nothing to do with that:</span><br />
	<span class="i1">they will not wallow in sin.</span><br />
	<span>Do not get into the habit of using coarse and foul language</span><br />
	<span class="i1">since this involves sinful words.</span><br />
	<span>Remember your father and mother</span><br />
	<span class="i1">when you are sitting with the great,</span><br />
	<span>for fear you forget yourself in their presence</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and behave like a fool,</span><br />
	<span>and then wish you had not been born</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and curse the day of your birth.</span><br />
	<span>No one in the habit of using shameful language</span><br />
	<span class="i1">will break himself of it as long as he lives.</span>
</p>

<h4>Lechery (23:16–21)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>There are two types of people who commit sin after sin</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and a third who attracts retribution —</span><br />
	<span>desire, blazing like a furnace,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">will not die down until it has been sated —</span><br />
	<span>the man who lusts after members of his own family</span><br />
	<span class="i1">is not going to stop until he is quite burnt out;</span><br />
	<span>every food is sweet to the promiscuous,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and he will not desist until he dies;</span><br />
	<span>and the man who sins against the marriage bed</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and says to himself, “Who can see me?</span><br />
	<span>There is darkness all around me, the walls hide me,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">no one can see me, why should I worry?</span><br />
	<span>The Most High will not remember my sins”.</span><br />
	<span class="i1">What he fears are human eyes,</span><br />
	<span>he does not realise that the eyes of the Lord</span><br />
	<span class="i1">are ten thousand times brighter than the sun,</span><br />
	<span>observing every aspect of human behaviour,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">seeing into the most secret corners.</span><br />
	<span>All things were known to him before they were created,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and are still, now that they are finished.</span><br />
	<span>This man will be punished in view of the whole town,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and will be seized when he least expects it.</span>
</p>

<h4>The adulteress (23:22–27)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Similarly the woman unfaithful to her husband,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">who provides him with an heir by another man:</span><br />
	<span>first, she has disobeyed the Law of the Most High;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">secondly, she has been false to her husband;</span><br />
	<span>and thirdly, she has gone whoring in adultery</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and conceived children by another man.</span><br />
	<span>She will be led before the assembly,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">an enquiry will be held about her children.</span><br />
	<span>Her children will strike no root,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">her branches will bear no fruit.</span><br />
	<span>She will leave an accursed memory behind her,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">her shame will never be wiped out.</span><br />
	<span>And those who survive her will recognise</span><br />
	<span class="i1">that nothing is better than fearing the Lord,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and nothing sweeter than adherence to the Lord’s commandments.</span>
</p>

<h4>Discourse of wisdom (24:1–22)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Wisdom speaks her own praises,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">in the midst of her people she glories in herself.</span><br />
	<span>She opens her mouth in the assembly of the Most High,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">she glories in herself in the presence of the Mighty One:</span><br />
	<span>“I came forth from the mouth of the Most High,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and I covered the earth like mist.</span><br />
	<span>I had my tent in the heights,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and my throne was a pillar of cloud.</span><br />
	<span>Alone, I have made the circuit of the heavens</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and walked through the depths of the abyss.</span><br />
	<span>Over the waves of the sea and over the whole earth,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and over every people and nation I have held sway.</span><br />
	<span>Among all these I searched for rest,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and looked to see in whose territory I might pitch camp.</span><br />
	<span>Then the Creator of all things instructed me</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and he who created me fixed a place for my tent.</span><br />
	<span>He said, ‘Pitch your tent in Jacob,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">make Israel your inheritance’.</span><br />
	<span>From eternity, in the beginning, he created me,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and for eternity I shall remain.</span><br />
	<span>In the holy tent I ministered before him</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and thus became established in Zion.</span><br />
	<span>In the beloved city he has given me rest,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and in Jerusalem I wield my authority.</span><br />
	<span>I have taken root in a privileged people,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">in the Lord’s property, in his inheritance.</span><br />
	<span>I have grown tall as a cedar on Lebanon,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">as a cypress on Mount Hermon;</span><br />
	<span>I have grown tall as a palm in En-Gedi,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">as the rose bushes of Jericho;</span><br />
	<span>as a fine olive in the plain,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">as a plane tree, I have grown tall.</span><br />
	<span>Like cinnamon and acanthus, I have yielded a perfume,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">like choice myrrh, have breathed out a scent,</span><br />
	<span>like galbanum, onycha, labdanum,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">like the smoke of incense in the tent.</span><br />
	<span>I have spread my branches like a terebinth,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and my branches are glorious and graceful.</span><br />
	<span>I am like a vine putting out graceful shoots,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">my blossoms bear the fruit of glory and wealth.</span><br />
	<span>Approach me, you who desire me,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and take your fill of my fruits,</span><br />
	<span>for memories of me are sweeter than honey,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">inheriting me is sweeter than the honeycomb.</span><br />
	<span>They who eat me will hunger for more,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">they who drink me will thirst for more.</span><br />
	<span>No one who obeys me will ever have to blush,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">no one who acts as I dictate will ever sin”.</span>
</p>

<h4>Wisdom and the Law (24:23–34)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>All this is no other than the Book of the Covenant of the Most High God,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the Law that Moses enjoined on us,</span><br />
	<span>an inheritance for the communities of Jacob.</span><br />
	<span>This is what makes wisdom brim over like the Pishon,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">like the Tigris in the season of fruit,</span><br />
	<span>what makes intelligence overflow like the Euphrates,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">like the Jordan at harvest time;</span><br />
	<span>and makes discipline flow like the Nile,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">like the Gihon when the grapes are harvested.</span><br />
	<span>The first man did not finish discovering about her,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">nor has the most recent tracked her down;</span><br />
	<span>for her thoughts are wider than the sea,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and her designs more profound than the abyss.</span><br />
	<span>And I, like a conduit from a river,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">like a watercourse running into a garden,</span><br />
	<span>I said, “I am going to water my orchard,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">I intend to irrigate my flower beds”.</span><br />
	<span>And see, my conduit has grown into a river,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and my river has grown into a sea.</span><br />
	<span>Making discipline shine forth from daybreak,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">I shall send its light far and wide.</span><br />
	<span>I shall pour out teaching like prophecy,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">as a legacy to all future generations.</span><br />
	<span>And note, I have been working not merely for myself,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but for all who are seeking wisdom.</span>
</p>

<h4>Proverbs (25:1–2)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>There are three things my soul delights in,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and which are delightful to God and to all people:</span><br />
	<span>concord between brothers, friendship between neighbours,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and a wife and husband who live happily together.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>There are three sorts of people my soul hates,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and whose existence I consider an outrage:</span><br />
	<span>the poor swollen with pride, the rich who is a liar</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and an adulterous old man who has no sense.</span>
</p>

<h4>The aged (25:3–6)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>If you have gathered nothing in your youth,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">how can you discover anything in your old age?</span><br />
	<span>How fine a thing: sound judgement with grey hairs,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and for greybeards to know how to advise!</span><br />
	<span>How fine a thing: wisdom in the aged,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and considered advice coming from people of distinction!</span><br />
	<span>The crown of the aged is ripe experience,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">their glory, the fear of the Lord.</span>
</p>

<h4>Numerical proverbs (25:7–11)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>There are nine things I can think of which strike me as happy,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and a tenth which is now on my tongue:</span><br />
	<span>the man who can be proud of his children,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he who lives to see the downfall of his enemies;</span><br />
	<span>happy is he who keeps house with a sensible wife;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he who does not toil with ox and donkey;</span><br />
	<span>he who has never sinned with his tongue;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he who does not serve a man less worthy than himself;</span><br />
	<span>happy is he who has acquired good sense</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and can find attentive ears for what he has to say;</span><br />
	<span>how great is he who has acquired wisdom;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but unsurpassed is one who fears the Lord.</span><br />
	<span>The fear of the Lord surpasses everything;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">what can compare with someöne who has mastered that?</span>
</p>

<h4>Women (25:13–26:18)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Any wound rather than a wound of the heart!</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Any spite rather than the spite of woman!</span><br />
	<span>Any evil rather than an evil caused by an enemy!</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Any vengeance rather than the vengeance of a foe!</span><br />
	<span>There is no poison worse than the poison of a snake,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">there is no fury worse than the fury of an enemy.</span><br />
	<span>I would sooner keep house with a lion or a dragon</span><br />
	<span class="i1">than keep house with a spiteful wife.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>A woman’s spite changes her appearance</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and makes her face as grim as a bear’s.</span><br />
	<span>When her husband goes out to dinner with his neighbours,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he cannot help heaving bitter sighs.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>No spite can approach the spite of a woman,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">may a sinner’s lot be hers!</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Like the climbing of a sandhill for elderly feet,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">such is a garrulous wife for a quiet husband.</span><br />
	<span>Do not be taken in by a woman’s beauty,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">never lose your head over a woman.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Bad temper, insolence and shame hold sway</span><br />
	<span class="i1">where the wife supports the husband.</span><br />
	<span>Low spirits, gloomy face, stricken heart:</span><br />
	<span class="i1">such is a spiteful wife.</span><br />
	<span>Slack hands and sagging knees:</span><br />
	<span class="i1">such is the wife who does not make her husband happy.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Sin began with a woman,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and thanks to her we must all die.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not let water find a leak,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">nor a spiteful woman give free rein to her tongue.</span><br />
	<span>If she will not do as you tell her,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">get rid of her.</span><br />
	<span>How blessed is the husband of a really good wife;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the number of his days will be doubled.</span><br />
	<span>A perfect wife is the joy of her husband,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he will live out the years of his life in peace.</span><br />
	<span>A good wife is the best of portions,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">reserved for those who fear the Lord;</span><br />
	<span>rich or poor, their hearts will be glad,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">their faces cheerful, whatever the season.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>There are three things that I dread,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and a fourth which terrifies me:</span><br />
	<span>slander by a whole town, the gathering of a mob,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and a false accusation — these are all worse than death;</span><br />
	<span>but a woman jealous of a woman means heartbreak and sorrow,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and all this is the scourge of the tongue.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>A bad wife is a badly fitting ox-yoke,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">trying to master her is like grasping a scorpion.</span><br />
	<span>A drunken wife will goad anyone to fury,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">she cannot conceal her own degradation.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>A woman’s wantonness shows in her wide-eyed look,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">her eyelashes leave no doubt.</span><br />
	<span>Keep a headstrong daughter under firm control,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">or, feeling free, she will take advantage of it.</span><br />
	<span>Keep a strict watch on her shameless eye,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not be surprised if she disgraces you.</span><br />
	<span>Like a thirsty traveller she will open her mouth</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and drink any water she comes across;</span><br />
	<span>she will sit down in front of every tent-peg</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and open her quiver to any arrow.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The grace of a wife will charm her husband,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">her understanding will make him the stronger.</span><br />
	<span>A silent wife is a gift from the Lord,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">no price can be put on a well-trained character.</span><br />
	<span>A modest wife is a boon twice over,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">a chaste character cannot be over-valued.</span><br />
	<span>Like the sun rising over the mountains of the Lord,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">such is the beauty of a good wife in a well-run house.</span><br />
	<span>Like a lamp shining on the sacred lamp-stand,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">such is a beautiful face on a well-proportioned body.</span><br />
	<span>Like golden pillars on a silver base,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">such are shapely legs on firm-set heels.</span>
</p>

<h4>Depressing things (26:28)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>There are two things which grieve my heart</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and a third arouses my anger:</span><br />
	<span>a warrior wasting away through poverty,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the intelligent treated with contempt,</span><br />
	<span>someöne turning back from virtue to sin —</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the Lord marks out such a person for a violent death.</span>
</p>

<h4>Commerce (26:29–27:3)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>It is difficult for a merchant to avoid doing wrong</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and for a trader not to incur sin.</span><br />
	<span>Many have sinned for the sake of profit,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">one who hopes to be rich must turn a blind eye.</span><br />
	<span>A peg will stick in the joint between two stones,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and sin will wedge itself between selling and buying.</span><br />
	<span>Whoëver does not firmly hold to the fear of the Lord,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">his house will soon be overthrown.</span>
</p>

<h4>Speech (27:4–7)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>In a shaken sieve the rubbish is left behind,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">so too the defects of a person appear in speech.</span><br />
	<span>The kiln tests the work of the potter,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the test of a person is in conversation.</span><br />
	<span>The orchard where the tree grows is judged by its fruit,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">similarly words betray what a person feels.</span><br />
	<span>Do not praise anyone who has not yet spoken,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">since this is where people are tested.</span>
</p>

<h4>Virtue (27:8–15)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>If you pursue virtue, you will attain it</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and put it on like a festal gown.</span><br />
	<span>Birds consort with their kind,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">truth comes home to those who practise it.</span><br />
	<span>The lion lies in wait for its prey,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">so does sin for those who do wrong.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The conversation of the devout is wisdom at all times,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but the fool is as changeable as the moon.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>When visiting stupid people, choose the right moment,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but among the thoughtful take your time.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The conversation of fools is disgusting,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">raucous their laughter in their sinful pleasures.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The talk of hard-swearing people makes your hair stand on end,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">their brawling makes you stop your ears.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>A quarrel between the proud leads to bloodshed,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and their insults are embarrassing to hear.</span>
</p>

<h4>Secrets (27:16–21)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>A betrayer of secrets forfeits all trust</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and will never find the kind of friend he wants.</span><br />
	<span>Be fond of a friend and keep faith with him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but if you have betrayed his secrets, do not go after him any more;</span><br />
	<span>for, as one destroys a person by killing him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">so you have killed your neighbour’s friendship,</span><br />
	<span>and as you let a bird slip through your fingers,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">so you have let your friend go, and will not catch him.</span><br />
	<span>Do not go after him — he is far away,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he has fled like a gazelle from the snare.</span><br />
	<span>For a wound can be bandaged and abuse forgiven,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but for the betrayer of a secret there is no hope.</span>
</p>

<h4>Hypocrisy (27:22–29)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Someöne with a sly wink is plotting mischief,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">no one can dissuade him from it.</span><br />
	<span>Honey-tongued to your face,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he is lost in admiration at your words;</span><br />
	<span>but behind your back he has other things to say,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and turns your words into a stumbling-block.</span><br />
	<span>I have found many things to hate, but nothing as much as him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the Lord hates him too.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Whoëver throws a stone in the air, throws it on to his own head;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">a treacherous blow cuts both ways.</span><br />
	<span>The man who digs a pit falls into it,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">whoëver sets a snare will be caught by it.</span><br />
	<span>On anyone who does evil, evil will recoil,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">without his knowing where it comes from.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Sarcasm and abuse are the mark of the arrogant,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but vengeance lies in wait like a lion for such a one.</span><br />
	<span>The trap will close on all who rejoice in the downfall of the devout,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and pain will eat them up before they die.</span>
</p>

<h4>Resentment (27:30–28:7)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Resentment and anger, these are foul things too,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and a sinner is a master at them both.</span><br />
	<span>Whoëver exacts vengeance will experience the vengeance of the Lord,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">who keeps strict account of sin.</span><br />
	<span>Pardon your neighbour any wrongs done to you,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and when you pray, your sins will be forgiven.</span><br />
	<span>If anyone nurses anger against another,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">can one then demand compassion from the Lord?</span><br />
	<span>Showing no pity for someöne like oneself,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">can one then plead for one’s own sins?</span><br />
	<span>Mere creature of flesh, yet cherishing resentment! —</span><br />
	<span class="i1">who will forgive one for sinning?</span><br />
	<span>Remember the last things, and stop hating,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">corruption and death, and be faithful to the commandments.</span><br />
	<span>Remember the commandments, and do not bear your fellow ill-will,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">remember the covenant of the Most High, and ignore the offence.</span>
</p>

<h4>Quarrels (28:8–12)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Avoid quarrelling and you will sin less;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for the hot-tempered provokes quarrels,</span><br />
	<span>a sinner sows trouble between friends,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">introducing discord among the peaceful.</span><br />
	<span>The way a fire burns depends on its fuel,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">a quarrel spreads in proportion to its violence;</span><br />
	<span>a man’s rage depends on his strength,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">his fury grows fiercer in proportion to his wealth.</span><br />
	<span>A sudden quarrel kindles fire,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">a hasty dispute leads to bloodshed.</span><br />
	<span>Blow on a spark and up it flares,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">spit on it and out it goes;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">both are the effects of your mouth.</span>
</p>

<h4>The tongue (28:13–26)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>A curse on the scandal-monger and double-talker,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">such a person has ruined many who lived in concord.</span><br />
	<span>That third tongue has shattered the peace of many</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and driven them from nation to nation;</span><br />
	<span>it has pulled down fortified cities,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and overthrown the houses of the great.</span><br />
	<span>The third tongue has had upright wives divorced,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">depriving them of reward for their hard work.</span><br />
	<span>No one who listens to it will ever know peace of mind,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">will ever live in peace again.</span><br />
	<span>A stroke of the whip raises a weal,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but a stroke of the tongue breaks bones.</span><br />
	<span>Many have fallen by the edge of the sword,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but many more have fallen by the tongue.</span><br />
	<span>Blessed is anyone who has been sheltered from it,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and has not experienced its fury,</span><br />
	<span>who has not dragged its yoke about,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">or been bound in its chains;</span><br />
	<span>for its yoke is an iron yoke,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">its chains are bronze chains;</span><br />
	<span>the death it inflicts is a miserable death,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Sheol is preferable to it.</span><br />
	<span>It cannot gain a hold over the devout,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">they are not burnt by its flames.</span><br />
	<span>Those who desert the Lord will fall into it,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">it will flare up inextinguishably among them,</span><br />
	<span>it will be let loose against them like a lion,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">it will tear them like a leopard.</span><br />
	<span>Be sure you put a thorn-hedge around your property,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">lock away your silver and gold;</span><br />
	<span>then make scales and weights for your words,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and put a door with bolts across your mouth.</span><br />
	<span>Take care you take no false step through it,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">in case you fall a prey to him who lies in wait.</span>
</p>

<h4>Loans (29:1–7)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Making your neighbour a loan is an act of mercy,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to lend him a helping hand is to keep the commandments.</span><br />
	<span>Lend to your neighbour in his time of need,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and in your turn repay your neighbour on time.</span><br />
	<span>Be as good as your word and keep faith with him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and you will find your needs met every time.</span><br />
	<span>Many treat a loan as a windfall,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and embarrass those who have come to their rescue.</span><br />
	<span>Until he gets something, a man will kiss his neighbour’s hand,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and refer diffidently to his wealth;</span><br />
	<span>but when the loan falls due, he puts this off,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he repays with offhand words,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and pleads the inconvenience of the time.</span><br />
	<span>Even if he can be made to pay, his creditor will recover barely half,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and consider even that a windfall.</span><br />
	<span>But otherwise he will be cheated of his money,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and undeservedly gain himself an enemy;</span><br />
	<span>the man will pay him back in curses and abuse,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and with insults instead of honour.</span><br />
	<span> Many, not out of malice, refuse to lend;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">they are merely anxious not to be cheated for nothing.</span>
</p>

<h4>Almsgiving (29:8–13)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Nevertheless, be patient with those who are badly off,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not keep them waiting on your generosity.</span><br />
	<span>In obedience to the commandment, help the poor;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not turn the poor away empty-handed in their need.</span><br />
	<span>Spend your money on your brother or your friend,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not leave it under a stone to rust away.</span><br />
	<span>Use your wealth as the Most High has decreed;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">you will find that more profitable than gold.</span><br />
	<span>Stock your store-rooms with almsgiving;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">this will save you from all misfortune.</span><br />
	<span>Better than sturdy shield or weighty spear,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">this will fight for you against the enemy.</span>
</p>

<h4>Guarantees (29:14–20)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>A good man will go surety for his neighbour;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">only a shameless wretch would desert him.</span><br />
	<span>Do not forget the favour your guarantor has done you;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he has given his life for you.</span><br />
	<span>A sinner is careless of his guarantor’s prosperity,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the ungrateful forgets his deliverer.</span><br />
	<span>Going surety has ruined many who were prosperous,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">tossing them about in a heavy sea.</span><br />
	<span>It has driven the powerful from home</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to wander among foreign nations.</span><br />
	<span>A wicked man in a hurry to stand guarantor</span><br />
	<span class="i1">in the hope of profit, is hurrying to be sentenced.</span><br />
	<span>Come to your neighbour’s help as far as you can,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but take care not to fall into the same plight.</span>
</p>

<h4>Staying in other people’s houses (29:21–28)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The first thing in life is water, and bread, and clothing,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and a house for the sake of privacy.</span><br />
	<span>Better the life of the poor under a roof of planks,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">than lavish fare in somebody else’s house.</span><br />
	<span>Whether you have little or much, be content with it,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and you will not hear your household complaining.</span><br />
	<span>It is a miserable life, going from house to house;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">wherever you stay, you dare not open your mouth,</span><br />
	<span>you do not belong, you receive no thanks for the drink you pour out</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and hear embittering words into the bargain:</span><br />
	<span>“Come along, stranger, lay the table,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">what have you got ready? give me something to eat!”.</span><br />
	<span>“Go away, stranger, make room for someöne important;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">my brother is coming to stay, I need the house”.</span><br />
	<span>It is hard for the reasonable</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to be begrudged hospitality</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to be shamed like a debtor.</span>
</p>

<h4>Bringing up children (30:1–13)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Whoëver loves his son will beat him frequently</span><br />
	<span class="i1">so that in after years the son may be his comfort.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Whoëver is strict with his son will reap the benefit,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and be able to boast of him to his acquaintances.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Whoëver educates his son will be the envy of his enemy,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and will be proud of him among his friends.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Even when the father dies, he might well not be dead,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">since he leaves his likeness behind him.</span><br />
	<span>In life he has had the joy of his company,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">dying, he has no anxieties.</span><br />
	<span>He leaves an avenger against his enemies</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and a rewarder of favours for his friends.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Whoëver coddles his son will bandage his wounds,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">his heart will turn over at every cry.</span><br />
	<span>A badly broken-in horse turns out stubborn,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">a son left to himself turns out headstrong.</span><br />
	<span>Pamper your child and he will terrorise you,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">play along with him and he will bring you sorrow.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not laugh with him, or one day you will weep with him</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and end up gnashing your teeth.</span><br />
	<span>While he is young, do not allow him his freedom</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and do not wink at his mistakes.</span><br />
	<span>Bend his neck in youth,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">bruise his ribs while he is a child,</span><br />
	<span>or else he will grow stubborn and disobedient,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and hurt you very deeply.</span><br />
	<span>Be strict with your son, and persevere with him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">or you will rue his insolence.</span>
</p>

<h4>Health (30:14–20)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Better be poor if healthy and fit</span><br />
	<span class="i1">than rich if tormented in body.</span><br />
	<span>Health and strength are better than any gold,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">a robust body than untold wealth.</span><br />
	<span>No riches can outweigh bodily health,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">no enjoyment surpass a cheerful heart.</span><br />
	<span>Better death than a wretched life,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and everlasting rest than chronic illness.</span><br />
	<span>Good things lavished on a closed mouth</span><br />
	<span class="i1">are like food offerings put on a grave.</span><br />
	<span>What use is an offering to an idol</span><br />
	<span class="i1">which can neither eat nor smell?</span><br />
	<span>How describe someöne pursued by the Lord’s displeasure?</span><br />
	<span class="i1">He looks and sighs</span><br />
	<span>like a eunuch embracing a pretty girl — how he sighs!</span>
</p>

<h4>Happiness (30:21–25)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not abandon yourself to sorrow,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not torment yourself with brooding.</span><br />
	<span>Gladness of heart is life to anyone,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">joy is what gives length of days.</span><br />
	<span>Give your cares the slip, console your heart,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">chase sorrow far away;</span><br />
	<span>for sorrow has been the ruin of many,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and is no use to anybody.</span><br />
	<span>Jealousy and anger shorten your days,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and worry brings premature old age.</span><br />
	<span>A genial heart makes a good trencherman,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">someöne who enjoys a good meal.</span>
</p>

<h4>Riches (31:1–11)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The sleeplessness brought by wealth makes a person lose weight,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the worry it causes drives away sleep.</span><br />
	<span>The worries of the daytime prevent you from sleeping,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">like a serious illness, they keep sleep at bay.</span><br />
	<span>The rich for ever toils, piling up money,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and then, leaving off, he is gorged with luxuries;</span><br />
	<span>the poor for ever toils, barely making a living,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and then, leaving off, is poorer than ever.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>No one who loves money can easily avoid sinning,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">whoëver pursues profit will be corrupted by it.</span><br />
	<span>Gold has been the ruin of many;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">their coming destruction was self-evident,</span><br />
	<span>since it is a snare for those who sacrifice to it</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and stupid people all get caught in it.</span><br />
	<span>Happy the rich who is found to be blameless</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and does not go chasing after gold.</span><br />
	<span>Who is he, so that we can congratulate him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for he has achieved marvels among his fellows?</span><br />
	<span>Who has been through this test and emerged perfect?</span><br />
	<span class="i1">He may well be proud of that!</span><br />
	<span>Who has had the chance to sin and has not sinned,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">had the chance to do wrong and has not done it?</span><br />
	<span>His fortune will be firmly based</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the assembly will acclaim his generosity.</span>
</p>

<h4>Dinner parties (31:12–24)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>If you are sitting down to a lavish table,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not display your greed,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not say, “What a lot to eat!”.</span><br />
	<span>Remember, it is bad to have a greedy eye.</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Is any creature more wicked than the eye?</span><br />
	<span class="i1">— That is why it is always weeping!</span><br />
	<span>Do not reach out for anything your host has his eye on,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not jostle him at the dish.</span><br />
	<span>Judge your fellow-guest’s needs by your own,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">be thoughtful in everyway.</span><br />
	<span>Eat what is offered you like a well brought-up person,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not wolf your food or you will earn dislike.</span><br />
	<span>For politeness’ sake be the first to stop;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not act the glutton, or you will give offence,</span><br />
	<span>and if you are sitting with a large party,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not help yourself before the others do.</span><br />
	<span>A little is quite enough for a well-bred person;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">his breathing is easy when he lies in bed.</span><br />
	<span>A moderate diet ensures sound sleep,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">one gets up early, in the best of spirits.</span><br />
	<span>Sleeplessness, biliousness and gripe</span><br />
	<span class="i1">are what the glutton has to endure.</span><br />
	<span>If you are forced to eat too much,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">get up, go and vomit, and you will feel better.</span><br />
	<span>Listen to me, my child, do not disregard me,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">eventually you will see the force of my words.</span><br />
	<span>Be moderate in all your activities</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and illness will never overtake you.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>People praise the person who keeps a splendid table,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and their opinion of his munificence is sound.</span><br />
	<span>But a niggardly host provokes universal resentment</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and people will retail instances of his meanness.</span>
</p>

<h4>Wine (31:25–31)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not play the valiant at your wine,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for wine has been the undoing of many.</span><br />
	<span>The furnace proves the temper of steel,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and wine proves hearts in the drinking bouts of braggarts.</span><br />
	<span>Wine gives life</span><br />
	<span class="i1">if drunk in moderation.</span><br />
	<span>What is life worth without wine?</span><br />
	<span class="i1">It came into being to make people happy.</span><br />
	<span>Drunk at the right time and in the right amount,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">wine makes for a glad heart and a cheerful mind.</span><br />
	<span>Bitterness of soul comes of wine drunk to excess</span><br />
	<span class="i1">out of temper or bravado.</span><br />
	<span>Drunkenness excites the stupid to a fury to his own harm,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">it reduces his strength while leading to blows.</span><br />
	<span>Do not provoke your fellow-guest at a wine feast,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not make fun of him when he is enjoying himself,</span><br />
	<span>do not take him to task</span><br />
	<span class="i1">or annoy him by reclaiming money owed.</span>
</p>

<h4>Banquets (32:1–13)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Have they made you the presider? Do not let it go to your head,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">behave like everyone else in the party,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">see that they are happy and then sit down yourself.</span><br />
	<span>Having discharged your duties, take your place</span><br />
	<span class="i1">so that your joy may be through theirs,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and you may receive the crown for your competence.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Speak, old man — it is proper that you should —</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but with discretion: do not spoil the music.</span><br />
	<span>If someöne is singing, do not ramble on</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and do not play the sage at the wrong moment.</span><br />
	<span>An amber seal on a precious stone,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">such is a concert of music at a wine feast.</span><br />
	<span>An emerald seal in a golden setting,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">such are strains of music with a vintage wine.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Speak, young man, when you must,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but twice at most, and then only if questioned.</span><br />
	<span>Keep to the point, say much in few words;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">give the impression of knowing but not wanting to speak.</span><br />
	<span>Among eminent people do not behave as though you were their equal;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not make frivolous remarks when someöne else is speaking.</span><br />
	<span>Lightning comes before the thunder,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">favour goes ahead of a modest person.</span><br />
	<span>Leave in good time, do not bring up the rear,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and hurry home without loitering.</span><br />
	<span>There amuse yourself, and do what you have a mind to,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but do not sin by arrogant talk.</span><br />
	<span>And for all this bless your Creator,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">who intoxicates you with his favours.</span>
</p>

<h4>The Fear of God (32:14–33:6)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Whoëver fears the Lord will accept his correction;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">those who look for him will win his favour.</span><br />
	<span>Whoëver seeks the Law will be nourished by it,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the hypocrite will find it a stumbling-block.</span><br />
	<span>Those who fear the Lord win his approval,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">their good deeds shining like a light.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The sinner waves reproof aside,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he finds an excuse for headstrong behaviour.</span><br />
	<span>A sensible person never scorns a warning;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">foreigners and the proud do not know about fear.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Never act without reflection,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and you will not regret your actions.</span><br />
	<span>Do not venture on a rough road,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for fear of stumbling over the stones.</span><br />
	<span>Do not be over-confident on an even road</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and beware of your own children.</span><br />
	<span>Watch yourself in everything you do;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">this is also the way to keep the commandments.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Anyone who trusts in the Law obeys its precepts,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">no one who has confidence in the Lord will come to harm.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>No evil will befall one who fears the Lord,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">such a one will be rescued even in the ordeal.</span><br />
	<span>No one who hates the Law is wise,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">one who is hypocritical about it is like a storm-tossed ship.</span><br />
	<span>An intelligent person will put faith in the Law,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for such a one the Law is as dependable as a prophecy.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Prepare what you have to say and you will get a hearing,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">marshal your information before you answer.</span><br />
	<span>The feelings of a fool are like a cart-wheel,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">a fool’s thought revolves like a turning axle.</span><br />
	<span>A rutting stallion is like a sarcastic friend;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he neighs, whoëver rides him.</span>
</p>

<h4>Inequality (33:7–19)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Why is one day better than another,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">though the sun gives the same daylight throughout the year?</span><br />
	<span>They have been differentiated in the mind of the Lord,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">who has diversified the seasons and feasts;</span><br />
	<span>some he has made more important and has hallowed,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">others he has made ordinary days.</span><br />
	<span>Human beings come from the ground,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Adam himself was formed out of earth;</span><br />
	<span>in the fullness of his wisdom</span><br />
	<span>the Lord has made distinctions between them,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and diversified their conditions.</span><br />
	<span>Some of them he has blessed,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">hallowing and setting them near him;</span><br />
	<span>others he has cursed and humiliated</span><br />
	<span class="i1">by degrading them from their positions.</span><br />
	<span>Like clay in the hands of the potter</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to mould as it pleases him,</span><br />
	<span>so are human beings in the hands of their Maker</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to reward as he judges right.</span><br />
	<span>Opposite evil stands good,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">opposite death, life;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">so too opposite the devout stands the sinner.</span><br />
	<span>Contemplate all the works of the Most High,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">you will find they go in pairs, by opposites.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Although the last to come, I have kept my eyes open</span><br />
	<span class="i1">like a man picking up what the grape-pickers have left.</span><br />
	<span>By the blessing of the Lord I have come in first,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and like a true grape-picker have filled my winepress.</span><br />
	<span>And note, I have not been working merely for myself,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but for all who seek instruction.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Listen to me, important public figures,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">presidents of the assembly, give ear!</span>
</p>

<h4>Independence (33:20–24)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Neither to son nor wife, brother nor friend,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">give power over yourself during your own lifetime.</span><br />
	<span>And do not give your property to anyone else,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">in case you regret it and have to ask for it back.</span><br />
	<span>As long as you live and there is breath in your body,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not yield power over yourself to anyone;</span><br />
	<span>better for your children to come begging to you,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">than for you to have to go begging to them.</span><br />
	<span>In all you do be the master,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and leave a reputation unstained.</span><br />
	<span>The day your life draws to a close,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">at the hour of death, then distribute your heritage.</span>
</p>

<h4>Slaves (33:25–33)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Fodder, the stick and burdens for a donkey,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">bread, discipline and work for a slave.</span><br />
	<span>Work your slave hard, and you will have peace of mind,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">leave his hands idle, and he will be asking for his freedom.</span><br />
	<span>Yoke and harness will bow the neck,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for a bad servant, torments and the rack.</span><br />
	<span>Set him to work, so that he will not be idle;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">idleness teaches every kind of mischief.</span><br />
	<span>Keep him at his duties, where he should be,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">if he is disobedient, clap him in irons.</span><br />
	<span>But do not be over-exacting with anyone,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and do nothing contrary to justice.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>You have only one slave? Treat him like yourself,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">since you have acquired him with blood.</span><br />
	<span>You have only one slave? Treat him as a brother,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">since you need him as you need yourself.</span><br />
	<span>If you ill-treat him and he runs away,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">which way will you go to look for him?</span>
</p>

<h4>Dreams (34:1–8)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Vain and deceptive hopes are for the foolish,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and dreams lend wings to fools.</span><br />
	<span>As well clutch at shadows and chase the wind</span><br />
	<span class="i1">as put any faith in dreams.</span><br />
	<span>Dreams are no different from mirrors;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">confronting a face, the reflection of that face.</span><br />
	<span>What can be cleansed by uncleanness,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">what can be verified by falsehood?</span><br />
	<span>Divinations, auguries and dreams are nonsense,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">like the fantasies of a pregnant woman.</span><br />
	<span>Unless sent as emissaries from the Most High,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not give them a thought;</span><br />
	<span>for dreams have led many astray,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and those who relied on them have come to grief.</span><br />
	<span>Fulfilling the Law requires no such falsehood,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and wisdom is perfected in veracity.</span>
</p>

<h4>Travelling (34:9–17)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>A much travelled man knows many things,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and a man of great experience will talk sound sense.</span><br />
	<span>Someöne who has never had his trials knows little;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but the travelled man is master of every situation.</span><br />
	<span>I have seen many things on my travels,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">I have understood more than I can put into words.</span><br />
	<span>I have often been in danger of death,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but I have been spared, and this is why:</span><br />
	<span>the spirit of those who fear the Lord can survive,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for their hope is in someöne with power to save them.</span><br />
	<span>No one who fears the Lord need ever hesitate,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">or ever be daunted, since the Lord is his hope.</span><br />
	<span>Happy the soul of one who fears the Lord.</span><br />
	<span class="i1">On whom does he rely? Who supports him?</span><br />
	<span>The eyes of the Lord watch over those who love him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he is their powerful protection and their strong support,</span><br />
	<span>their screen from the desert wind, their shelter from the midday sun,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">a guard against stumbling, an assurance against a fall.</span><br />
	<span>He revives the spirit and brightens the eyes,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he gives health, life and blessing.</span>
</p>

<h4>Sacrifices (34:18–26)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The sacrifice of an offering unjustly acquired is a mockery;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the gifts of the impious are unacceptable.</span><br />
	<span>The Most High takes no pleasure in offerings from the godless,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">multiplying sacrifices will not gain pardon for sin.</span><br />
	<span>Offering sacrifice from the property of the poor</span><br />
	<span class="i1">is as bad as slaughtering a son before his father’s eyes.</span><br />
	<span>A meagre diet is the very life of the poor,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to deprive them of it is to commit murder.</span><br />
	<span>To take away a fellow-man’s livelihood is to kill him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to deprive an employee of his wages is to shed blood.</span><br />
	<span>If one person builds while another pulls down,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">what will they get out of it but trouble?</span><br />
	<span>If one person prays and another calls down a curse,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to which one’s voice is the Master going to listen?</span><br />
	<span>If someöne washes after touching a corpse, and then touches it again,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">what is the good of his washing?</span><br />
	<span>Just so with someöne who fasts for sin,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and then goes and commits it again.</span><br />
	<span>Who is going to hear that person’s prayer?</span><br />
	<span class="i1">What is the good of the self-abasement?</span>
</p>

<h4>The Law and sacrifices (35:1–10)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>One who keeps the Law multiplies offerings;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">one who follows the commandments offers communion sacrifices.</span><br />
	<span>Proof of gratitude is an offering of fine flour,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">almsgiving a sacrifice of praise.</span><br />
	<span>To abandon wickedness is what pleases the Lord,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to give up wrong-doing is an expiatory sacrifice.</span><br />
	<span>Do not appear empty-handed in the Lord’s presence;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for all these things are due under the commandment.</span><br />
	<span>The offering of the upright graces the altar,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and its savour rises before the Most High.</span><br />
	<span>The sacrifice of the upright is acceptable,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">its memorial will not be forgotten.</span><br />
	<span>Honour the Lord with generosity,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not stint the first-fruits you bring.</span><br />
	<span>Add a smiling face to all your gifts,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and be cheerful as you dedicate your tithes.</span><br />
	<span>Give to the Most High as he has given to you,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">as generously as your means can afford;</span><br />
	<span>for the Lord is a good rewarder,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he will reward you seven times over.</span>
</p>

<h4>Divine justice (35:11–24)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not try to bribe him with presents, he will not accept them,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not put your faith in wrongly motivated sacrifices;</span><br />
	<span>for the Lord is a judge</span><br />
	<span class="i1">who is utterly impartial.</span><br />
	<span>He never shows partiality to the detriment of the poor,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he listens to the plea of the injured party.</span><br />
	<span>He does not ignore the orphan’s supplication,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">nor the widow’s as she pours out her complaint.</span><br />
	<span>Do the widow’s tears not run down her cheeks,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">as she accuses the man who is the cause of them?</span><br />
	<span>Whoëver wholeheartedly serves God will be accepted,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">his petitions will carry to the clouds.</span><br />
	<span>The prayer of the humble pierces the clouds:</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and until it does, he is not to be consoled,</span><br />
	<span>nor will he desist until the Most High takes notice of him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">acquits the upright and delivers judgement.</span><br />
	<span>And the Lord will not be slow,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">nor will he be dilatory on their behalf,</span><br />
	<span>until he has crushed the loins of the merciless</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and exacted vengeance on the nations,</span><br />
	<span>until he has eliminated the hordes of the arrogant</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and broken the sceptres of the wicked,</span><br />
	<span>until he has repaid all people as their deeds deserve</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and human actions as their intentions merit,</span><br />
	<span>until he has judged the case of his people</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and made them rejoice in his mercy.</span><br />
	<span>Mercy is welcome in time of trouble,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">like rain clouds in time of drought.</span>
</p>

<h4>Prayer for the deliverance and restoration of Israel (36:1–17)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Take pity on us, Master, Lord of the universe, look at us,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">spread fear of yourself throughout all other nations.</span><br />
	<span>Raise your hand against the foreign nations</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and let them see your might.</span><br />
	<span>As, in their sight, you have proved yourself holy to us,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">so now, in our sight, prove yourself great to them.</span><br />
	<span>Let them acknowledge you, just as we have acknowledged</span><br />
	<span class="i1">that there is no God but you, Lord.</span><br />
	<span>Send new portents, do fresh wonders,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">win glory for your hand and your right arm.</span><br />
	<span>Rouse your fury, pour out your rage,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">destroy the opponent, annihilate the enemy.</span><br />
	<span>Hasten the day, remember the oath,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and let people tell of your mighty deeds.</span><br />
	<span>Let fiery wrath swallow up the survivor,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and destruction overtake those who oppress your people.</span><br />
	<span>Crush the heads of hostile rulers</span><br />
	<span class="i1">who say, “There is no one else but us!”.</span><br />
	<span>Gather together all the tribes of Jacob,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">restore them their heritage as at the beginning.</span><br />
	<span>Take pity, Lord, on the people called by your name,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">on Israel whom you have made your first-born.</span><br />
	<span>Have compassion on your holy city,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">on Jerusalem, the place where you rest.</span><br />
	<span>Fill Zion with your praises</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and your sanctuary with your glory.</span><br />
	<span>Vindicate those whom you created first,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">fulfil what has been prophesied in your name.</span><br />
	<span>Give those who wait for you their reward,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">let your prophets be proved true.</span><br />
	<span>Grant, Lord, the prayer of your servants,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">in the terms of Aaron’s blessing on your people,</span><br />
	<span>so that all the earth’s inhabitants may acknowledge</span><br />
	<span class="i1">that you are the Lord, the everlasting God.</span>
</p>

<h4>Discrimination (36:18–20)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The stomach takes in all kinds of food,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but some foods are better than others.</span><br />
	<span>As the palate discerns the flavour of game,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">so a shrewd listener detects lying words.</span><br />
	<span>A perverse character causes depression in others;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">it needs experience to know how to repay such a one.</span>
</p>

<h4>Choosing a wife (36:21–27)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>A woman will accept any husband,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but some daughters are better than others.</span><br />
	<span>A woman’s beauty delights the beholder,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">a man likes nothing better.</span><br />
	<span>If her tongue is kind and gentle,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">her husband is the happiest of men.</span><br />
	<span>The man who takes a wife has the makings of a fortune,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">a helper to match himself, a pillar of support.</span><br />
	<span>When property has no fence, it is open to plunder,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">when a man has no wife, he is aimless and querulous.</span><br />
	<span>Will anyone trust an armed thief</span><br />
	<span class="i1">who flits from town to town?</span><br />
	<span>So it is with the man who has no nest,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and lodges wherever night overtakes him.</span>
</p>

<h4>False friends (37:1–6)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span class="i1">Any friend will say, “I am your friend too”,</span><br />
	<span>but some friends are friends only in name.</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Is it not a deadly sorrow</span><br />
	<span>when a comrade or a friend turns enemy?</span><br />
	<span class="i1">O evil inclination, why were you created,</span><br />
	<span>to cover the earth with deceit?</span><br />
	<span class="i1">One kind of comrade congratulates a friend in prosperity</span><br />
	<span>but in time of trouble appears on the other side.</span><br />
	<span class="i1">One kind of comrade genuinely feels for a friend</span><br />
	<span>and when it comes to a fight, springs to arms.</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Do not forget the genuine friend,</span><br />
	<span>do not push him out of mind once you are rich.</span>
</p>

<h4>Advisers (37:7–15)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Any adviser will offer advice,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but some are governed by self-interest.</span><br />
	<span>Beware of someöne who offers advice;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">first find out what he wants himself—</span><br />
	<span>since his advice coincides with his own interest —</span><br />
	<span class="i1">in case he has designs on you</span><br />
	<span>and tells you, “You are on the right road”,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but stands well clear to see what will happen to you.</span><br />
	<span>Do not consult anyone who looks at you askance,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">conceal your plans from people jealous of you.</span><br />
	<span>Do not consult a woman about her rival,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">or a coward about war,</span><br />
	<span>a merchant about prices,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">or a buyer about selling,</span><br />
	<span>anyone mean about gratitude,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">or anyone selfish about kindness,</span><br />
	<span>a lazy fellow about any sort of work,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">or a casual worker about finishing a job,</span><br />
	<span>an idle servant about a major undertaking —</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not rely on these for any advice.</span><br />
	<span>But have constant recourse to some devout person,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">whom you know to be a keeper of the commandments,</span><br />
	<span>whose soul matches your own,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and who, if you go wrong, will be sympathetic.</span><br />
	<span>Finally, stick to the advice your own heart gives you,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">no one can be truer to you than that;</span><br />
	<span>since a person’s soul often gives a clearer warning</span><br />
	<span class="i1">than seven watchmen perched on a watchtower.</span><br />
	<span>And besides all this beg the Most High</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to guide your steps into the truth.</span>
</p>

<h4>True and false wisdom (37:16–26)</h4>
<p class="poem">
	<span>Reason should be the basis for every activity,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">reflection must come before any undertaking.</span><br />
	<span>Thoughts are rooted in the heart,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and this sends out four branches:</span><br />
	<span>good and evil, life and death,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and mistress of them always is the tongue.</span><br />
	<span>One kind of person is clever at teaching others,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">yet is no good whatever to himself;</span><br />
	<span>another, very eloquent, is detested</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and ends by starving to death,</span><br />
	<span>not having won the favour of the Lord,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and being destitute of all wisdom.</span><br />
	<span>Another considers himself wise</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and proclaims his intellectual conclusions as certainties.</span><br />
	<span>But the truly wise instructs his people</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and his intellectual conclusions are certainties.</span><br />
	<span>The wise is showered with blessings,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and all who see him will call him happy.</span><br />
	<span>Human life lasts a number of days,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but the days of Israel are beyond counting.</span><br />
	<span>The wise will earn confidence among the people,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">his name will live for ever.</span>
</p>

<h4>Moderation (37:27–31)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>During your life, my child, see what suits your constitution,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not give it what you find disagrees with it;</span><br />
	<span>for not everything is good for everybody,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">nor does everybody like everything.</span><br />
	<span>Do not be insatiable for any delicacy,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not be greedy for food,</span><br />
	<span>for over-eating leads to illness</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and excess leads to liver-attacks.</span><br />
	<span>Many people have died from over-eating;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">control yourself, and so prolong your life.</span>
</p>

<h4>Medicine and illness (38:1–15)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Treat the doctor with the honour that is his due,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">in consideration of his services;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for he too has been created by the Lord.</span><br />
	<span>Healing itself comes from the Most High,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">like a gift received from a king.</span><br />
	<span>The doctor’s learning keeps his head high,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the great regard him with awe.</span><br />
	<span>The Lord has brought forth medicinal herbs from the ground,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and no one sensible will despise them.</span><br />
	<span>Did not a piece of wood once sweeten the water,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">thus giving proof of its power?</span><br />
	<span>He has also given some people knowledge,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">so that they may draw credit from his mighty works.</span><br />
	<span>He uses these for healing and relieving pain;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the druggist makes up a mixture from them.</span><br />
	<span>Thus, there is no end to his activities;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">thanks to him, well-being exists throughout the world.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>My child, when you are ill, do not rebel,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but pray to the Lord and he will heal you.</span><br />
	<span>Renounce your faults, keep your hands unsoiled,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and cleanse your heart from all sin.</span><br />
	<span>Offer incense and a memorial of fine flour,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">make as rich an offering as you can afford.</span><br />
	<span>Then let the doctor take over — the Lord created him too —</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not let him leave you, for you need him.</span><br />
	<span>There are times when good health depends on doctors.</span><br />
	<span class="i1">For they, in their turn, will pray the Lord</span><br />
	<span>to grant them the grace to relieve</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and to heal, and so prolong your life.</span><br />
	<span>Whoëver sins in the eyes of his Maker,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">let such a one come under the care of the doctor!</span>
</p>

<h4>Mourning (38:16–23)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>My child, shed tears over the dead,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">lament for the dead to show your sorrow,</span><br />
	<span>then bury the body with due ceremony</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and do not fail to honour the grave.</span><br />
	<span>Weep bitterly, beat your breast,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">observe the mourning the dead deserves</span><br />
	<span>for a day or two, to avoid censorious comment,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and then be comforted in your sorrow;</span><br />
	<span>for grief can lead to death,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">a grief-stricken heart loses all energy.</span><br />
	<span>In affliction sorrow persists,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">a life of grief is hard to bear.</span><br />
	<span>Do not abandon your heart to grief,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">drive it away, bear your own end in mind.</span><br />
	<span>Do not forget, there is no coming back;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">you cannot help the dead, and you will harm yourself.</span><br />
	<span>“Remember my doom, since it will be yours too;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">I yesterday, you today!”.</span><br />
	<span>Once the dead are laid to rest, let their memory rest,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not fret for them, once their spirit departs.</span>
</p>

<h4>Trades and crafts (38:24–34)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Leisure gives the scribe the chance to acquire wisdom;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">a man with few commitments can grow wise.</span><br />
	<span>How can the ploughman become wise,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">whose sole ambition is to wield the goad,</span><br />
	<span>driving his oxen, engrossed in their work,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">his conversation limited to bullocks,</span><br />
	<span>his thoughts absorbed in the furrows he traces</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and his long evenings spent in fattening heifers?</span><br />
	<span>Similarly with all workmen and craftsmen,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">toiling day and night;</span><br />
	<span>those who engrave seals,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for ever trying to think of a new design,</span><br />
	<span>concentrating on catching a good likeness</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and staying up late to get the work done.</span><br />
	<span>Similarly with the blacksmith sitting by his anvil;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he considers what to do with the pig-iron,</span><br />
	<span>the breath of the fire scorches his skin,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">as he contends with the heat of the furnace;</span><br />
	<span>the noise of the hammer deafens him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">his eyes are fixed on the pattern;</span><br />
	<span>he concentrates on getting the job done well</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and stays up late to apply the finishing touches.</span><br />
	<span>Similarly with the potter, sitting at his work,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">turning the wheel with his feet;</span><br />
	<span>constantly on the alert over his work,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">each flick of the finger premeditated;</span><br />
	<span>he pummels the clay with his arm,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and with his feet he kneads it;</span><br />
	<span>he concentrates on applying the glaze right</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and stays up late to clean the kiln.</span><br />
	<span>All these people rely on their hands</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and each is skilled at his own craft.</span><br />
	<span>A town could not be inhabited without them,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">there would be no settling, no travelling.</span><br />
	<span>But you will not find them in the parliament,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">they do not hold high rank in the assembly.</span><br />
	<span>They do not sit on the judicial bench,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and they do not meditate on the Law.</span><br />
	<span>They are not remarkable for their culture or judgement,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">nor are they found frequenting the philosophers.</span><br />
	<span>They sustain the structure of the world,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and their prayer is concerned with their trade.</span>
</p>

<h4>The scribe (39:1–11)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Not so with one who concentrates his mind</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and his meditation on the Law of the Most High.</span><br />
	<span>He researches into the wisdom of all the Ancients,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he occupies his time with the prophecies.</span><br />
	<span>He preserves the discourses of famous men,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he is at home with the niceties of parables.</span><br />
	<span>He researches into the hidden sense of proverbs,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he ponders the obscurities of parables.</span><br />
	<span>He enters the service of princes,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he is seen in the presence of rulers.</span><br />
	<span>He travels in foreign countries,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he has experienced human good and human evil.</span><br />
	<span>At dawn and with all his heart</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he turns to the Lord his Creator;</span><br />
	<span>he pleads in the presence of the Most High,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he opens his mouth in prayer</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and makes entreaty for his sins.</span><br />
	<span>If such be the will of the great Lord,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he will be filled with the spirit of intelligence,</span><br />
	<span>he will shower forth words of wisdom,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and in prayer give thanks to the Lord.</span><br />
	<span>He will grow upright in purpose and learning,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he will ponder the Lord’s hidden mysteries.</span><br />
	<span>He will display the instruction he has received,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">taking his pride in the Law of the Lord’s covenant.</span><br />
	<span>Many will praise his intelligence</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and it will never be forgotten.</span><br />
	<span>His memory will not disappear,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">generation after generation his name will live.</span><br />
	<span>Nations will proclaim his wisdom,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the assembly will celebrate his praises.</span><br />
	<span>If he lives long, his name will be more glorious than a thousand others,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and if he dies, that will satisfy him just as well.</span>
</p>

<h4>Invitation to praise God (39:12–35)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>And here are some more of my reflections:</span><br />
	<span class="i1">yes, I am as full as the moon at the full!</span><br />
	<span>Listen to me, devout children, and blossom</span><br />
	<span class="i1">like the rose that grows on the bank of a watercourse.</span><br />
	<span>Give off a sweet smell like incense,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">flower like the lily, spread your fragrance abroad,</span><br />
	<span>sing a song of praise</span><br />
	<span class="i1">blessing the Lord for all his works.</span><br />
	<span>Declare the greatness of his name,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">proclaim his praise</span><br />
	<span>with song and with lyre,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and this is how you must sing his praises:</span><br />
	<span>“How wonderful, the actions of the Lord!</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Whatever he orders is done at the proper time!”.</span><br />
	<span>You must not say, “What is this? Why is that?”.</span><br />
	<span class="i1">There is a proper time for every question.</span><br />
	<span>At his word, the water stops and piles up high,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">at his voice, the watery reservoirs take shape,</span><br />
	<span>at his command, whatever he wants is done,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">no one can stop him, if he intends to save.</span><br />
	<span>He can see whatever human beings are doing,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">nothing can be hidden from his eye;</span><br />
	<span>his gaze stretches from eternity to eternity,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and nothing can astonish him.</span><br />
	<span>You must not say, “What is this? Why is that?”,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for everything has been made for a purpose.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>As his blessing covers the dry land like a river</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and soaks it like a flood,</span><br />
	<span>so retribution is his legacy to the nations,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">just as he has turned fresh waters to salt.</span><br />
	<span>His ways are as smooth for the devout,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">as they are full of obstacles for the wicked.</span><br />
	<span>Good things were created from the beginning for good people,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">as bad ones were for sinners.</span><br />
	<span>The prime needs of human beings for living</span><br />
	<span class="i1">are water and fire, iron and salt,</span><br />
	<span>wheat-flour, milk and honey,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the juice of the grape, oil and clothing.</span><br />
	<span>All these are good for those who are good,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but turn out bad for sinners.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Some winds have been created for punishing,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">in his fury, he uses them as scourges;</span><br />
	<span>on the day of doom, they unleash their violence</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and appease the wrath of their Creator.</span><br />
	<span>Fire and hail, famine and death,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">have all been created for punishing.</span><br />
	<span>Wild animals’ fangs, scorpions, vipers,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the avenging sword for the ruin of the godless:</span><br />
	<span>all of them exult in discharging his orders,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">ready on earth whenever the need arises and,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">when their time comes, not falling short of his word.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>That is why I was determined from the outset,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">why I have pondered and why I have written,</span><br />
	<span>“The works of the Lord are all good,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">when the time is right, he gives whatever is needed.</span><br />
	<span>You must not say, ‘This is worse than that’,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for, sooner or later, everything proves its worth.</span><br />
	<span>So now, sing with all your heart and voice,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and bless the name of the Lord!”.</span>
</p>

<h4>Human wretchedness (40:1–11)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>A hard lot has been created for human beings,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">a heavy yoke lies on the children of Adam</span><br />
	<span>from the day they come out of their mother’s womb,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">until the day they return to the mother of them all.</span><br />
	<span>What fills them with foreboding and their hearts with fear</span><br />
	<span class="i1">is dread of the day of death.</span><br />
	<span>From the one who sits on a glorious throne</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to the wretch in dust and ashes,</span><br />
	<span>from the one who wears purple and a crown</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to the one dressed in sacking,</span><br />
	<span>all is fury and jealousy, turmoil and unrest,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">fear of death, rivalry, strife.</span><br />
	<span>And even at night while he rests on his bed</span><br />
	<span class="i1">his sleep only gives a new twist to his worries:</span><br />
	<span>scarcely has he lain down to rest,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">when in his sleep, as if in broad daylight,</span><br />
	<span>he is troubled with nightmares,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">like one who has escaped from a battle,</span><br />
	<span>and at the moment of rescue he wakes up,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">amazed that there was nothing to be afraid of!</span><br />
	<span>For all creatures, human and animal —</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and seven times more for sinners —</span><br />
	<span>there is death and blood and strife and the sword,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">disasters, famine, affliction, plague.</span><br />
	<span>These things were all created for the wicked,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the Flood came because of them.</span><br />
	<span>All that comes from the earth returns to the earth,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and what comes from the water returns to the sea.</span>
</p>

<h4>Various maxims (40:12–27)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>All bribery and injustice will be blotted out,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but good faith will stand for ever.</span><br />
	<span>Ill-gotten wealth will vanish like a torrent,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">like the single thunder-clap that heralds rain.</span><br />
	<span>When he opens his hand, he rejoices,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">by the same token, sinners come to ruin.</span><br />
	<span>The sprigs of the godless will not make many branches,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">tainted roots find only hard rock.</span><br />
	<span>The reed that grows by every lake and river’s edge</span><br />
	<span class="i1">is the first plant to be uprooted.</span><br />
	<span>Charity is a very paradise of blessing</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and almsgiving endures for ever.</span><br />
	<span>For a person of private means and one who works hard,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">life is pleasant,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">better off than either, one who finds a treasure.</span><br />
	<span>Children and the founding of a city perpetuate a name:</span><br />
	<span class="i1">more esteemed than either, a perfect wife.</span><br />
	<span>Wine and music cheer the heart;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">better than either, the love of wisdom.</span><br />
	<span>Flute and harp add sweetness to a song;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">better than either, a melodious voice.</span><br />
	<span>The eye longs for grace and beauty;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">better than either, the green of spring corn.</span><br />
	<span>Friend or comrade — it is always well met;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">better than either, a wife and husband.</span><br />
	<span>Brothers and allies are good in times of trouble;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">better than either, almsgiving to the rescue.</span><br />
	<span>Gold and silver will steady your feet;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">more esteemed than either, good advice.</span><br />
	<span>Money and strength make a confident heart;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">better than either, the fear of the Lord.</span><br />
	<span>With fear of the Lord, nothing is lacking:</span><br />
	<span class="i1">no need to seek for other help.</span><br />
	<span>Fear of the Lord is a paradise of blessing,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">a better protection than the highest reputation.</span>
</p>

<h4>Sponging (40:28–30)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>My child, do not live by sponging off others,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">better be dead than be a sponger.</span><br />
	<span>A life spent in eyeing someöne else’s table</span><br />
	<span class="i1">cannot be accounted a life at all.</span><br />
	<span>Other people’s food defiles the gullet;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">a wise, well-brought-up person will beware of doing this.</span><br />
	<span>What a sponger says may sound very sweet</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but in his belly there burns a fire.</span>
</p>

<h4>Death (41:1–4)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>O death, how bitter it is to remember you</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for someöne peacefully living with his possessions,</span><br />
	<span>for someöne with no worries and everything going well</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and who can still enjoy his food!</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>O death, your sentence is welcome</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to one in want, whose strength is failing,</span><br />
	<span>to one worn out with age and a thousand worries,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">resentful and impatient!</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not dread death’s sentence;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">remember those who came before you and those who will come after.</span><br />
	<span>This is the sentence passed on all living creatures by the Lord,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">so why object to what seems good to the Most High?</span><br />
	<span>Whether your life lasts ten or a hundred or a thousand years,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">its length will not be held against you in Sheol.</span>
</p>

<h4>The fate of the wicked (41:5–13)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Hateful brats, such are the children of sinners,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">who foregather in the haunts of the godless.</span><br />
	<span>The inheritance of sinners’ children is doomed to perish,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">their posterity will endure lasting reproach.</span><br />
	<span>A godless father will be blamed by his children</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for the reproach he has brought on them.</span><br />
	<span>A bad outlook for you, godless people,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">who have forsaken the Law of God Most High.</span><br />
	<span>When you were born, you were born to be accursed,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and when you die, that curse will be your portion.</span><br />
	<span>All that comes from the earth returns to the earth,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">so too the wicked proceed from curse to destruction.</span><br />
	<span>Mourning concerns only the bodies of the dead,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but the worthless name of sinners will be blotted out.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Be careful of your reputation, for it will last you longer</span><br />
	<span class="i1">than a thousand great hoards of gold.</span><br />
	<span>A good life lasts a certain number of days,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but a good reputation lasts for ever.</span>
</p>

<h4>Sense of shame (41:14–42:8)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Keep my instructions and be at peace, my children.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Wisdom hidden away and treasure undisplayed,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">what use is either of these?</span><br />
	<span>Better someöne who hides his folly</span><br />
	<span class="i1">than one who hides his wisdom.</span><br />
	<span>Preserve a sense of shame in the following matters,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for not every kind of shame is right to harbour,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">nor is every situation correctly appraised by all.</span><br />
	<span>Be ashamed, before father and mother, of depraved behaviour,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and before prince or potentate of telling lies;</span><br />
	<span>of wrong-doing before judge or magistrate,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and of impiety before the assembly of the people;</span><br />
	<span>of sharp practice before your companion and your friend,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and of theft before the neighbourhood you live in.</span><br />
	<span>Before the truth and covenant of God,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">be ashamed of leaning elbows on the table,</span><br />
	<span>of being ungracious when giving or receiving,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">of ignoring those who greet you,</span><br />
	<span>of gazing at a loose woman,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">of repulsing your fellow-countryman,</span><br />
	<span>of misappropriating another’s portion or gift,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">of paying court to another man’s wife,</span><br />
	<span>of making advances to his servant-girl</span><br />
	<span class="i1">— do not go near her bed —</span><br />
	<span>of saying disagreeable things to friends</span><br />
	<span class="i1">— do not follow up a gift with a taunt —</span><br />
	<span>of repeating everything you hear</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and of betraying confidences.</span><br />
	<span>Then you will know what true shame is,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and you will find yourself in everyone’s graces.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The following things you should not be ashamed of,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and do not sin from fear of what others think:</span><br />
	<span>of the Law of the Most High or of the covenant,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">of a verdict that acquits the godless,</span><br />
	<span>of keeping accounts with a travelling companion,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">of settling property on your friends,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">of being accurate over scales and weights,</span><br />
	<span>of making small and large profits,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">of gaining from commercial transactions,</span><br />
	<span>of disciplining your children strictly,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">of lashing a wicked slave until you draw blood.</span><br />
	<span>With an interfering wife, it is as well to use your seal,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and where there are many hands, lock things up.</span><br />
	<span>Whatever stores you issue, do it by number and weight,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">spendings and takings, put everything in writing.</span><br />
	<span>Do not be ashamed to correct a stupid person or a fool,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">or an old dotard who bickers with young people.</span><br />
	<span>Then you will show yourself really educated</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and win the approval of everyone.</span>
</p>

<h4>Worries of a father with his daughter (42:9–11)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Unknown to her, a daughter keeps her father awake,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the worry she gives him drives away his sleep:</span><br />
	<span>in her youth, in case she never marries,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">married, in case she should be disliked,</span><br />
	<span>as a virgin, in case she should be defiled</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and found with child in her father’s house,</span><br />
	<span>having a husband, in case she goes astray,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">married, in case she should be sterile!</span><br />
	<span>Your daughter is headstrong? Keep a sharp look-out</span><br />
	<span class="i1">that she does not make you the laughing-stock of your enemies,</span><br />
	<span>the talk of the town, the object of common gossip,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and put you to public shame.</span>
</p>

<h4>Women (42:12–14)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not stare at any man for his good looks,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not sit down with women;</span><br />
	<span>for moth comes out of clothes,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and woman’s spite out of woman.</span><br />
	<span>Better a man’s spite than a woman’s kindness:</span><br />
	<span class="i1">women give rise to shame and reproach.</span>
</p>

<h2 id="ii">II: The Glory of God (42:15–50:29)</h2>

<h3 id="iia">A: In Nature (42:15–43:33)</h3>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Next, I shall remind you of the works of the Lord,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and tell of what I have seen.</span><br />
	<span>By the words of the Lord his works come into being</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and all creation obeys his will.</span><br />
	<span>The shining sun looks down on all things,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the work of the Lord is full of his glory.</span><br />
	<span>The Lord has not granted the Holy Ones the power</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to tell of all his marvels</span><br />
	<span>which the Almighty Lord has solidly constructed</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for the universe to stand firm in his glory.</span><br />
	<span>He has fathomed both the abyss and the human heart</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and seen into their devious ways;</span><br />
	<span>for the Most High knows all there is to know</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and sees the signs of the times.</span><br />
	<span>He declares what is past and what will be,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and reveals the trend of hidden things.</span><br />
	<span>Not a thought escapes him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">not a single word is hidden from him.</span><br />
	<span>He has embellished the magnificent works of his wisdom,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he is from everlasting to everlasting,</span><br />
	<span>nothing can be added to him, nothing taken away,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he needs no one’s advice.</span><br />
	<span>How lovely, all his works,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">how dazzling to the eye!</span><br />
	<span>They all live and last for ever,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and, whatever the circumstances, all obey.</span><br />
	<span>All things go in pairs, by opposites,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he has not made anything imperfect:</span><br />
	<span>one thing complements the excellence of another.</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Who could ever grow tired of gazing at his glory?</span>
</p>

<h4>The sun (43:1–5)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Pride of the heights, a clear vault of the sky —</span><br />
	<span class="i1">such is the beauty of the heavens, a glorious sight.</span><br />
	<span>The sun, as he emerges, proclaims at his rising,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">“How wonderful a thing, the work of the Most High!”.</span><br />
	<span>At his zenith, he parches the ground,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">who can withstand his blaze?</span><br />
	<span>We have to blow the furnace to produce any heat,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the sun burns the mountains three times as much;</span><br />
	<span>breathing out blasts of fire,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">flashing his rays, he dazzles the eyes.</span><br />
	<span>Great is the Lord who created him</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and whose word speeds him on his course.</span>
</p>

<h4>The moon (43:6–8)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>And then the moon, ever punctual</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to mark the times, an everlasting sign:</span><br />
	<span>It is the moon that signals the feasts,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">a luminary that wanes after being full.</span><br />
	<span>The month derives its name from hers,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">she waxes wonderfully in her phases,</span><br />
	<span>banner of the hosts on high,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">shining in the vault of heaven.</span>
</p>

<h4>The stars (43:9–10)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The glory of the stars makes the beauty of the sky,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">a brilliant adornment of the Lord on High.</span><br />
	<span>At the words of the Holy One they stand as he decrees,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and never grow slack at their watch.</span>
</p>

<h4>The rainbow (43:11–12)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>See the rainbow and praise its Maker,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">so superbly beautiful in its splendour.</span><br />
	<span>Across the sky it forms a glorious arc</span><br />
	<span class="i1">drawn by the hands of the Most High.</span>
</p>

<h4>The wonders of nature (43:13–33)</h4> 

<p class="poem">
	<span>By his command he sends the snow,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he speeds the lightning by his command.</span><br />
	<span>In the same way, his treasuries open</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the clouds fly out like birds.</span><br />
	<span>His great power solidifies the clouds,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">then pulverises them into hail.</span><br />
	<span>At the roar of his thunder, the earth writhes in labour,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">at the sight of him, the mountains quake.</span><br />
	<span>At his will the south wind blows,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">or the storm from the north and the whirlwind.</span><br />
	<span>He sprinkles snow like birds alighting,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">it comes down like locusts settling.</span><br />
	<span>The eye marvels at the beauty of its whiteness,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the mind is amazed at its falling.</span><br />
	<span>Over the earth, like salt, he also pours hoarfrost,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">which, when it freezes, bristles like thorns.</span><br />
	<span>The cold wind blows from the north,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and ice forms on the water;</span><br />
	<span>it forms on every piece of standing water,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">covering it like a breastplate.</span><br />
	<span>The wind swallows up the mountains and scorches the desert,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">like a fire it consumes the vegetation.</span><br />
	<span>But cloud brings swift healing,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and dew brings joy after the heat.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>By his own resourcefulness he has tamed the abyss,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and planted it with islands.</span><br />
	<span>Those who sail the sea tell of its dangers,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">their accounts fill our ears with amazement:</span><br />
	<span>for there too exist strange and wonderful works,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">animals of every kind and huge sea creatures.</span><br />
	<span>Thanks to God, his messenger reaches port,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">everything works out according to his word.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>We could say much more and still fall short;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to put it concisely, “He is all”.</span><br />
	<span>Where shall we find sufficient power to glorify him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">since he is the Great One, above all his works,</span><br />
	<span>the awe-inspiring Lord, stupendously great,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and wonderful in his power?</span><br />
	<span>Exalt the Lord in your praises</span><br />
	<span class="i1">as high as you may — still he surpasses you.</span><br />
	<span>Exert all your strength when you exalt him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not grow tired — you will never come to the end.</span><br />
	<span>Who has ever seen him to describe him?</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Who can glorify him as he deserves?</span><br />
	<span>Many mysteries remain even greater than these,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for we have seen only a few of his works,</span><br />
	<span>the Lord himself having created all things</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and given wisdom to those who are devout.</span>

<h3 id="iib">B: In History (44:1–50:29)</h3>

<h4>Eulogy of the ancestors (44:1–15)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Next let us praise illustrious men,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">our ancestors in their successive generations.</span><br />
	<span>The Lord has created an abundance of glory,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and displayed his greatness from earliest times.</span><br />
	<span>Some wielded authority as kings</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and were renowned for their strength;</span><br />
	<span>others were intelligent advisers</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and uttered prophetic sayings.</span><br />
	<span>Others directed the people by their advice,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">by their understanding of the popular mind,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and by the wise words of their teaching;</span><br />
	<span>others composed musical melodies</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and set down ballads;</span><br />
	<span>others were rich and powerful,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">living peacefully in their homes.</span><br />
	<span>All these were honoured by their contemporaries</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and were the glory of their day.</span><br />
	<span>Some of them left a name behind them,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">so that their praises are still sung.</span><br />
	<span>While others have left no memory,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and disappeared as though they had not existed.</span><br />
	<span>They are now as though they had never been,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and so too, their children after them.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>But here is a list of illustrious men</span><br />
	<span class="i1">whose good works have not been forgotten.</span><br />
	<span>In their descendants they find</span><br />
	<span class="i1">a rich inheritance, their posterity.</span><br />
	<span>Their descendants stand by the commandments</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and, thanks to them, so do their children’s children.</span><br />
	<span>Their offspring will last for ever,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">their glory will not fade.</span><br />
	<span>Their bodies have been buried in peace,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and their name lives on for all generations.</span><br />
	<span>The peoples will proclaim their wisdom,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the assembly will celebrate their praises.</span>
</p>

<h4>Enoch (44:16)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Enoch pleased the Lord and was transferred to heaven,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">an example for the conversion of all generations.</span>
</p>

<h4>Noah (44:17–18)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Noah was found perfectly upright,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">in the time of retribution he became the heir:</span><br />
	<span>because of him a remnant was preserved</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for the earth at the coming of the Flood.</span><br />
	<span>Everlasting covenants were made with him</span><br />
	<span class="i1">that never again should every living creature perish by flood.</span>
</p>

<h4>Abraham (44:19–21)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Abraham, the great ancestor of a host of nations,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">no one was ever his equal in glory.</span><br />
	<span>He observed the Law of the Most High,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and entered into a covenant with him.</span><br />
	<span>He confirmed the covenant in his own flesh,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and proved himself faithful under ordeal.</span><br />
	<span>The Lord therefore promised him on oath</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to bless the nations through his descendants,</span><br />
	<span>to multiply him like the dust on the ground,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to exalt his descendants like the stars,</span><br />
	<span>and to give them the land as their heritage,</span><br />
	<span>from one sea to the other,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">from the River to the ends of the earth.</span>
</p>

<h4>Isaac and Jacob (44:22–23)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>To Isaac too, for the sake of Abraham his father,</span><br />
	<span>he assured the blessing of all humanity;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he caused the covenant to rest on the head of Jacob.</span><br />
	<span>He confirmed him in his blessings</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and gave him the land as his inheritance;</span><br />
	<span>he divided it into portions,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and shared it out among the twelve tribes.</span>
</p>

<h4>Moses (45:1–6a)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>From Jacob’s stock he produced a generous man</span><br />
	<span class="i1">who found favour in the eyes of all humanity,</span><br />
	<span>beloved by God and people,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Moses, of blessed memory.</span><br />
	<span>He made him the equal of the holy ones in glory</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and made him strong, to the terror of his enemies.</span><br />
	<span>By the word of Moses, he made prodigies cease</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and raised him high in the respect of kings;</span><br />
	<span>he gave him commandments for his people,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and showed him something of his glory.</span><br />
	<span>For his loyalty and gentleness he sanctified him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">choosing him alone out of all human beings;</span><br />
	<span>he allowed him to hear his voice,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and led him into the darkness;</span><br />
	<span>he gave him the commandments face to face,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the law of life and knowledge,</span><br />
	<span>to teach Jacob his ordinances</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and Israel his decrees.</span>
</p>

<h4>Aaron (45:6b–22)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>He raised up Aaron, a holy man like Moses,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">his brother, of the tribe of Levi.</span><br />
	<span>He made an everlasting covenant with him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and gave him the priesthood of the people.</span><br />
	<span>He adorned him with impressive vestments,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he dressed him in a robe of glory.</span><br />
	<span>He clothed him in glorious perfection</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and invested him with rich ornaments,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the breeches, the long robe, the <i>ephod</i>.</span><br />
	<span>To surround the robe he gave him pomegranates,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and many gold bells all around</span><br />
	<span>to chime at every step,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for their sound to be heard in the Temple</span><br />
	<span class="i1">as a reminder to the children of his people;</span><br />
	<span>and a sacred vestment of gold and aquamarine</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and scarlet, the work of an embroiderer;</span><br />
	<span>the pectoral of judgement, the <i>urim</i> and <i>thummim</i>,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">of plaited crimson, the work of a craftsman;</span><br />
	<span>precious stones cut like seals</span><br />
	<span class="i1">mounted in gold, the work of a jeweller,</span><br />
	<span>as a reminder with their engraved inscriptions</span><br />
	<span class="i1">of the number of the tribes of Israel;</span><br />
	<span>and a golden diadem on his turban,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">engraved with the seal of consecration;</span><br />
	<span>superb ornamentation, magnificent work,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">adornment to delight the eye.</span><br />
	<span>There had never been such lovely things before him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and no one else has ever put them on,</span><br />
	<span>but only his own sons,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and his descendants for all time.</span><br />
	<span>His sacrifices were to be burnt entirely,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">twice each day and for ever.</span><br />
	<span>Moses consecrated him</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and anointed him with holy oil;</span><br />
	<span>and this was an everlasting covenant for him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and for his descendants as long as the heavens endure,</span><br />
	<span>that he should preside over worship, act as priest,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and bless the people in the name of the Lord.</span><br />
	<span>He chose him out of all the living</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to offer sacrifices to the Lord,</span><br />
	<span>incense and perfume as a memorial</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to make expiation for the people.</span><br />
	<span>He entrusted him with his commandments,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">committed to him the statutes of the Law</span><br />
	<span>for him to teach Jacob his decrees</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and enlighten Israel on his Law.</span><br />
	<span>Others plotted against him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">they were jealous of him in the desert,</span><br />
	<span>Dathan and Abiram and their men,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Korah and his crew in fury and rage.</span><br />
	<span>The Lord saw it and was displeased,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">his raging fury made an end of them;</span><br />
	<span>he worked miracles on them,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">consuming them by his flaming fire.</span><br />
	<span>And he added to Aaron’s glory,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he gave him an inheritance;</span><br />
	<span>he allotted him the offerings of the first-fruits,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">before all else, as much bread as he could want.</span><br />
	<span>Thus they eat the sacrifices of the Lord</span><br />
	<span class="i1">which he gave to him and his posterity.</span><br />
	<span>But of the people’s territory he inherits nothing,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he alone of all the people has no share,</span><br />
	<span>“For I myself am your share and heritage”.</span>
</p>

<h4>Phinehas (45:23–23)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Phinehas son of Eleazar is third in glory</span><br />
	<span class="i1">because of his zeal in the fear of the Lord,</span><br />
	<span>because he stood firm when the people revolted,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">with a staunch and courageous heart;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and in this way made expiation for Israel.</span><br />
	<span>Hence a covenant of peace was sealed with him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">making him governor of both sanctuary and people,</span><br />
	<span>and securing to him and his descendants</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the high priestly dignity for ever.</span><br />
	<span>There was also a covenant with David</span><br />
	<span class="i1">son of Jesse, of the tribe of Judah,</span><br />
	<span>a royal succession by exclusively linear descent,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but the succession of Aaron passes to all his descendants.</span><br />
	<span>May God endow your hearts with wisdom</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to judge his people uprightly,</span><br />
	<span>so that the virtues of your ancestors may never fade,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and their glory may pass to all their descendants!</span>
</p>

<h4>Joshua (46:1–6)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Mighty in war was Joshua son of Nun,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">successor to Moses in the prophetic office,</span><br />
	<span>who well deserved his name,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and was a great saviour of the chosen people,</span><br />
	<span>wreaking vengeance on the enemies who opposed him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and so bringing Israel into its inheritance.</span><br />
	<span>How splendid he was when, arms uplifted,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he brandished his sword against cities!</span><br />
	<span>Who had ever shown such determination as his?</span><br />
	<span class="i1">He himself led the battles of the Lord.</span><br />
	<span>Was not the sun held back by his hand,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and one day drawn out into two?</span><br />
	<span>He called on the Most High, the Mighty One,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">while pressing the enemies from all directions,</span><br />
	<span>and the great Lord answered him</span><br />
	<span class="i1">with hard and violent hailstones.</span><br />
	<span>He fell on that enemy nation,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and at the Descent destroyed all resistance</span><br />
	<span>to make the nations acknowledge his warlike prowess</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and that he was waging war on behalf of the Lord.</span>
</p>

<h4>Caleb (46:7–10)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>For he was a follower of the Mighty One,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">in the time of Moses showing his devotion,</span><br />
	<span>he and Caleb son of Jephunneh,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">by opposing the whole community,</span><br />
	<span>by preventing the people from sinning,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and by silencing the mutters of rebellion.</span><br />
	<span>Hence these two alone were preserved</span><br />
	<span class="i1">out of six hundred thousand men on the march,</span><br />
	<span>and brought into their inheritance,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">into a land where milk and honey flow.</span><br />
	<span>And the Lord conferred strength on Caleb too,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">which stayed by him into old age,</span><br />
	<span>so that he could invest the highlands of the country</span><br />
	<span class="i1">which his descendants kept as their inheritance,</span><br />
	<span>so that every Israelite might see</span><br />
	<span class="i1">that it is good to follow the Lord.</span>
</p>

<h4>The Judges (46:11–12)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The Judges too, each when he was called,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">all men whose hearts were never disloyal,</span><br />
	<span>who never turned their backs on the Lord —</span><br />
	<span class="i1">may their memory be blessed!</span><br />
	<span>May their bones flourish again from the tomb,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and may the names of those illustrious</span><br />
	<span class="i1">men be worthily borne by their sons!</span>
</p>

<h4>Samuel (46:13–20)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Samuel was the beloved of his Lord;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">prophet of the Lord, he instituted the kingdom,</span><br />
	<span>and anointed rulers over his people.</span><br />
	<span class="i1">By the Law of the Lord he judged the assembly,</span><br />
	<span>and the Lord watched over Jacob.</span><br />
	<span class="i1">By his loyalty he was recognised as a prophet,</span><br />
	<span>by his words he was known to be a trustworthy seer.</span><br />
	<span class="i1">He called on the Lord, the Mighty One,</span><br />
	<span>when his enemies pressed in from all directions,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">by offering a sucking lamb.</span><br />
	<span>And the Lord thundered from heaven,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and made his voice heard in a rolling peal;</span><br />
	<span>he massacred the leaders of the enemy,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and all the rulers of the Philistines.</span><br />
	<span>Before the time of his everlasting rest</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he bore witness to the Lord and his anointed,</span><br />
	<span>“Of no property, not even a pair of sandals,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">have I ever deprived a soul”.</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Nor did anyone accuse him.</span><br />
	<span>And, having fallen asleep, he prophesied again,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">warning the king of his end;</span><br />
	<span>he spoke from the depths of the earth in prophecy,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to blot out the wickedness of the people.</span>
</p>

<h4>Nathan (47:1)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>After him arose Nathan,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to prophesy in the time of David.</span>
</p>

<h4>David (47:2–11)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>As the fat is set apart from the communion sacrifice,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">so was David chosen out of the Israelites.</span><br />
	<span>He played with lions as though with kids,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and with bears as though with lambs.</span><br />
	<span>While still a boy, did he not slay the giant</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and take away the people’s shame,</span><br />
	<span>by hurling a stone from his sling</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and cutting short the boasting of Goliath?</span><br />
	<span>For he called on the Lord Most High,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">who gave strength to his right arm</span><br />
	<span>to put a mighty warrior to death</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and assert the strength of his own people.</span><br />
	<span>Hence they gave him credit for ten thousand,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and praised him while they blessed the Lord,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">by offering him a crown of glory.</span><br />
	<span>For he destroyed the enemies on every front,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he annihilated his foes, the Philistines,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and crushed their strength for ever.</span><br />
	<span>In all his activities he gave thanks</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to the Holy One Most High in words of glory;</span><br />
	<span>he put all his heart into his songs</span><br />
	<span class="i1">out of love for his Creator.</span><br />
	<span>He placed singers before the altar,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">melodiously to sing;</span><br />
	<span>he gave the feasts their splendour,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the festivals their solemn pomp,</span><br />
	<span>causing the Lord’s holy name to be praised</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the sanctuary to resound from dawn.</span><br />
	<span>The Lord took away his sins,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">making his strength ever greater;</span><br />
	<span>he gave him a royal covenant,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and a glorious throne in Israel.</span>
</p>

<h4>Solomon (47:12–22)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>A wise son succeeded him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">who lived content, thanks to him.</span><br />
	<span>Solomon reigned in a time of peace,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and God gave him peace all around</span><br />
	<span>so that he could raise a house to his name</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and prepare an everlasting sanctuary.</span><br />
	<span>How wise you were despite your youth,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">like a river, brimming over with intelligence!</span><br />
	<span>Your mind ranged the earth,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">you filled it with mysterious sayings.</span><br />
	<span>Your name reached the distant islands,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and you were loved for your peace.</span><br />
	<span>Your songs, your proverbs, your sayings</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and your answers were the wonder of the world.</span><br />
	<span>In the name of the Lord God,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">of him who is called the God of Israel,</span><br />
	<span>you amassed gold like so much tin,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and made silver as common as lead.</span><br />
	<span>You abandoned your body to women,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">you became the slave of your appetites.</span><br />
	<span>You stained your honour,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">you profaned your stock,</span><br />
	<span>so bringing retribution on your children</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and affliction for your folly:</span><br />
	<span>the empire split in two,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">from Ephraim arose a rebel kingdom.</span><br />
	<span>But the Lord never goes back on his mercy,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">never cancels any of his words,</span><br />
	<span>will neither deny offspring to his elect</span><br />
	<span class="i1">nor stamp out the line of the man who loved him.</span><br />
	<span>And hence, he has granted a remnant to Jacob</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and to David a root sprung from him.</span>
</p>

<h4>Rehoboam (47:23)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Solomon rested with his ancestors,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">leaving one of his stock as his successor,</span><br />
	<span>the stupidest member of the nation,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">brainless Rehoboam, who drove the people to rebel.</span>
</p>

<h4>Jeroboam (47:24–25)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Next, Jeroboam son of Nebat, who made Israel sin,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and set Ephraim on the way of evil;</span><br />
	<span>from then on their sins multiplied so excessively</span><br />
	<span class="i1">as to drive them out of their country;</span><br />
	<span>for they tried out every kind of wickedness,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">until vengeance overtook them.</span>
</p>

<h4>Elijah (48:1–11)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Then the prophet Elijah arose like a fire,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">his word flaring like a torch.</span><br />
	<span>It was he who brought famine on them</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and decimated them in his zeal.</span><br />
	<span>By the word of the Lord he shut up the heavens,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">three times also he brought down fire.</span><br />
	<span>How glorious you were in your miracles, Elijah!</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Has anyone reason to boast as you have? —</span><br />
	<span>rousing a corpse from death,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">from Sheol, by the word of the Most High;</span><br />
	<span>dragging kings down to destruction,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and high dignitaries from their beds;</span><br />
	<span>hearing a rebuke on Sinai</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and decrees of punishment on Horeb;</span><br />
	<span>anointing kings as avengers,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and prophets to succeed you;</span><br />
	<span>taken up in the whirlwind of fire,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">in a chariot with fiery horses;</span><br />
	<span>designated in the prophecies of doom</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to allay God’s wrath before the fury breaks,</span><br />
	<span>to turn the hearts of fathers towards their children,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and to restore the tribes of Jacob.</span><br />
	<span>Blessed, those who will see you,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and those who have fallen asleep in love;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for we too shall certainly have life.</span>
</p>

<h4>Elisha (48:12–14)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Such was Elijah, who was enveloped in a whirlwind;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and Elisha was filled with his spirit;</span><br />
	<span>throughout his life no ruler could shake him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and no one could subdue him.</span><br />
	<span>No task was too hard for him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and even in death his body prophesied.</span><br />
	<span>In his lifetime he performed wonders,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and in death his works were marvellous.</span>
</p>

<h4>Infidelity and punishment (48:15–16)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Despite all this the people did not repent,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">nor did they give up their sins,</span><br />
	<span>until they were herded out of their country</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and scattered all over the earth;</span><br />
	<span>only a few of the people were left,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">with a ruler of the House of David.</span><br />
	<span>Some of them did what pleased the Lord,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">others piled sin on sin.</span>
</p>

<h4>Hezekiah (48:17–21)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Hezekiah fortified his city,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and laid on a water-supply inside it;</span><br />
	<span>with iron he tunnelled through the rock</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and constructed storage-tanks.</span><br />
	<span>In his days Sennacherib invaded</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and sent Rabshakeh;</span><br />
	<span>he lifted his hand against Zion,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and boasted loudly in his arrogance.</span><br />
	<span>Then their hearts and hands trembled,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">they felt the pangs of a woman in labour,</span><br />
	<span>but they called on the merciful Lord,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">stretching out their hands towards him.</span><br />
	<span>Swiftly the Holy One heard them from heaven</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and delivered them by the agency of Isaiah;</span><br />
	<span>he struck the camp of the Assyrians</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and his Angel annihilated them.</span>
</p>

<h4>Isaiah (48:22–25)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>For Hezekiah did what is pleasing to the Lord,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and was steadfast in the ways of David his father,</span><br />
	<span>enjoined on him by the prophet Isaiah,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">a great man trustworthy in his vision.</span><br />
	<span>In his days the sun moved back;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he prolonged the life of the king.</span><br />
	<span>In the power of the spirit he saw the last things,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he comforted the mourners of Zion,</span><br />
	<span>he revealed the future to the end of time,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and hidden things long before they happened.</span>
</p>

<h4>Josiah (49:1–3)</h4>
<p class="poem">
	<span>The memory of Josiah is like blended incense</span><br />
	<span class="i1">prepared by the perfumer’s art;</span><br />
	<span>it is as sweet as honey to all mouths,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and like music at a wine feast.</span><br />
	<span>He took the right course, of converting the people,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he rooted out the iniquitous abominations,</span><br />
	<span>he set his heart on the Lord,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">in godless times he upheld the cause of religion.</span>
</p>

<h4>The last kings and prophets (49:4–10)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Apart from David, Hezekiah and Josiah,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">they all heaped wrong on wrong,</span><br />
	<span>they abandoned the Law of the Most High:</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the kings of Judah disappeared;</span><br />
	<span>for they handed their power over to others</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and their honour to a foreign nation.</span><br />
	<span>The holy, chosen city was burnt down,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">her streets were left deserted,</span><br />
	<span>as Jeremiah had predicted; for they had ill-treated him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">though consecrated a prophet in his mother’s womb,</span><br />
	<span>to tear up and afflict and destroy,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but also to build up and to plant.</span><br />
	<span>Ezekiel saw a vision of glory</span><br />
	<span class="i1">which God showed to him above the chariot of the great winged creatures,</span><br />
	<span>for he mentioned the enemies in the downpour</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to the advantage of those who follow the right way.</span><br />
	<span>As for the twelve prophets,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">may their bones flower again from the tomb,</span><br />
	<span>since they have comforted Jacob</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and redeemed him in faith and hope.</span>
</p>

<h4>Zerubbabel and Joshua (49:11–12)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>How shall we extol Zerubbabel?</span><br />
	<span class="i1">He was like a signet ring on the right hand,</span><br />
	<span>so too was Joshua son of Jozadak;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">they who in their days built the Temple</span><br />
	<span>and raised a sanctuary sacred to the Lord,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">destined to everlasting glory.</span>
</p>

<h4>Nehemiah (49:13)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Great too is the memory of Nehemiah,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">who rebuilt our walls which lay in ruins,</span><br />
	<span>erected the bolted gates</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and rebuilt our houses.</span>
</p>

<h4>Retrospect (49:14–16)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>No one else has ever been created on earth to equal Enoch,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for he was taken up from earth.</span><br />
	<span>And no one else ever born has been like Joseph,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the leader of his brothers, the prop of his people;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">his bones received a visitation.</span><br />
	<span>Shem and Seth were the most honoured of men,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">but above every living creature is Adam.</span>
</p>

<h4>Simon the high priest (50:1–21)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>It was the High Priest Simon son of Onias</span><br />
	<span class="i1">who repaired the Temple during his lifetime</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and in his day fortified the sanctuary.</span><br />
	<span>He laid the foundations of double depth,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the high buttresses of the Temple precincts.</span><br />
	<span>In his day the pool was excavated,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">a reservoir as huge as the sea.</span><br />
	<span>Anxious to save the people from ruin,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">he fortified the city against siege.</span><br />
	<span>How splendid he was with the people thronging around him,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">when he emerged from the curtained shrine,</span><br />
	<span>like the morning star among the clouds,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">like the moon at the full,</span><br />
	<span>like the sun shining on the Temple of the Most High,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">like the rainbow gleaming against brilliant clouds,</span><br />
	<span>like a rose in springtime,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">like a lily by a spring,</span><br />
	<span>like a branch of the incense tree in summer,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">like fire and incense in the censer,</span><br />
	<span>like a massive golden vessel</span><br />
	<span class="i1">encrusted with every kind of precious stone,</span><br />
	<span>like an olive tree loaded with fruit,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">like a cypress soaring to the clouds;</span><br />
	<span>when he took his ceremonial robe</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and put on his magnificent ornaments,</span><br />
	<span>when he went up to the holy altar</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and filled the sanctuary precincts with his grandeur;</span><br />
	<span>when he received the portions from the hands of the priests,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">himself standing by the altar hearth,</span><br />
	<span>crowned with the circle of his brothers,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">as a cedar of Lebanon is by its foliage,</span><br />
	<span>as though surrounded by the trunks of palm trees.</span><br />
	<span class="i1">When all the sons of Aaron in their glory,</span><br />
	<span>with the offerings of the Lord in their hands,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">stood before the whole assembly of Israel,</span><br />
	<span>while he completed the rites at the altars,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">nobly presenting the offerings to the Almighty, Most High!</span><br />
	<span>He would reach out his hand to the cup</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and pour a libation of wine,</span><br />
	<span>pouring it at the foot of the altar,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">a fragrance pleasing to the Most High, King of All;</span><br />
	<span>then the sons of Aaron would shout</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and blow their metal trumpets,</span><br />
	<span>making a mighty sound ring out</span><br />
	<span class="i1">as a reminder before the Most High;</span><br />
	<span>and immediately the people all together</span><br />
	<span class="i1">would fall on their faces to the ground,</span><br />
	<span>in adoration of their Lord,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the Almighty, God Most High,</span><br />
	<span>and with the cantors chanting their hymns of praise.</span><br />
	<span class="i1">Sweet was the melody of all these voices,</span><br />
	<span>as the people pleaded with the Lord Most High</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and prayed in the presence of the Merciful,</span><br />
	<span>until the service of the Lord was completed</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the ceremony at an end.</span><br />
	<span>Then he would come down and raise his hands</span><br />
	<span class="i1">over the whole assembly of the Israelites,</span><br />
	<span>to give them the Lord’s blessing from his lips,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">being privileged to pronounce his name;</span><br />
	<span>and once again the people would bow low</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to receive the blessing of the Most High.</span>
</p>

<h4>Exhortation (50:22–24)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>And now bless the God of all things,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the doer of great deeds everywhere,</span><br />
	<span>who has exalted our days from the womb</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and has acted mercifully towards us.</span><br />
	<span>May he grant us cheerful hearts</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and bring peace in our time,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">in Israel for ages on ages.</span><br />
	<span>May his mercy be faithfully with us,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">may he redeem us in our own times!</span>
</p>

<h4>Numerical proverb (50:25–26)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>There are two nations that my soul detests,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">the third is not a nation at all:</span><br />
	<span>the inhabitants of Mount Seir, the Philistines,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the stupid people living at Shechem.</span>
</p>

<h4>Conclusion (50:27–29)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Instruction in wisdom and knowledge</span><br />
	<span class="i1">is what has been written in this book</span><br />
	<span>by Jesus son of Sira Eleazar of Jerusalem,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">who has poured a rain of wisdom from his heart.</span><br />
	<span>Blessed is he who devotes his time to these</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and grows wise by taking them to heart!</span><br />
	<span>If he practises them he will be strong enough for anything,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">since the light of the Lord is his path.</span>

<h4>Hymn of thanksgiving (51:1–12)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>I shall give thanks to you, Lord and King,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and praise you, God my Saviour,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">I give thanks to your name;</span><br />
	<span>for you have been my guard and support</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and redeemed my body from destruction,</span><br />
	<span>from the snare of the lying tongue,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">from lips that fabricate falsehood;</span><br />
	<span>in the presence of my assailants, you were on my side;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">you have been my support, you have redeemed me,</span><br />
	<span>true to your abounding kindness</span><br />
	<span class="i1">— and the greatness of your name — you liberated me</span><br />
	<span>from the fangs of those seeking to devour me,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">from the clutches of those seeking my life,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">from the many ordeals which I have endured,</span><br />
	<span>from the stifling heat which hemmed me in,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">from the heart of a fire which I had not kindled,</span><br />
	<span>from deep in the belly of Sheol,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">treacherous denunciations to the king.</span><br />
	<span>My soul has been close to death,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">my life had gone down to the brink of Sheol.</span><br />
	<span>I was completely surrounded, there was no one to help me;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">I looked for someöne to help me, there was no one.</span><br />
	<span>Then I remembered your mercy, Lord,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and your deeds from earliest times,</span><br />
	<span>how you deliver those who wait for you patiently,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and save them from the clutches of their enemies.</span><br />
	<span>And I sent up my plea from the earth,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">I begged to be delivered from death.</span><br />
	<span>I called on the Lord, the father of my Lord,</span><br />
	<span>“Do not desert me in the days of ordeal,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">in the days of the proud, when we are helpless.</span><br />
	<span>I shall praise your name unceasingly</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and gratefully sing its praises”.</span><br />
	<span>And my plea was heard,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">for you saved me from destruction,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">you delivered me from that time of evil.</span><br />
	<span>And therefore I shall thank you and praise you,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and bless the name of the Lord.</span>
</p>

<h4>Poem on the quest for wisdom (51:13–30)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>When I was still a youth, before I went travelling,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">in my prayers I asked outright for wisdom.</span><br />
	<span>Outside the sanctuary I would pray for her,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and to the last I shall continue to seek her.</span><br />
	<span>From her blossoming to the ripening of her grape</span><br />
	<span class="i1">my heart has taken its delight in her.</span><br />
	<span>My foot has pursued a straight path,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">I have sought her ever since my youth.</span><br />
	<span>By bowing my ear a little, I have received her,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and have found much instruction.</span><br />
	<span>Thanks to her I have advanced;</span><br />
	<span class="i1">glory be to him who has given me wisdom!</span><br />
	<span>For I was determined to put her into practice,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">have earnestly pursued the good, and shall not be put to shame.</span><br />
	<span>My soul has fought to possess her,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">I have been scrupulous in keeping the Law;</span><br />
	<span>I have stretched out my hands to heaven</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and bewailed how little I knew of her;</span><br />
	<span>I have directed my soul towards her,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and in purity I have found her;</span><br />
	<span>having my heart fixed on her from the outset,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">I shall never be deserted;</span><br />
	<span>my very core having yearned to discover her,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">I have now acquired a good possession.</span><br />
	<span>In reward the Lord has given me a tongue</span><br />
	<span class="i1">with which I shall sing his praises.</span><br />
	<span>Come close to me, you ignorant,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">take your place in my school.</span><br />
	<span>Why complain about lacking these things</span><br />
	<span class="i1">when your souls are so thirsty for them?</span><br />
	<span>I have opened my mouth, I have said:</span><br />
	<span class="i1">“Buy her without money,</span><br />
	<span>put your necks under her yoke,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">let your souls receive instruction,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">she is near, within your reach”.</span><br />
	<span>See for yourselves: how slight my efforts have been</span><br />
	<span class="i1">to win so much peace.</span><br />
	<span>Buy instruction with a large sum of silver,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">thanks to her you will gain much gold.</span><br />
	<span>May your souls rejoice in the mercy of the Lord,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">may you never be ashamed of praising him.</span><br />
	<span>Do your work before the appointed time</span><br />
	<span class="i1">and at the appointed time he will give you your reward.</span>
