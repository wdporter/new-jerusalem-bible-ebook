<h2 id="i">I: The Plague of Locusts (1:2–2:27)</h2>

<h3 id="ia">A: Liturgy of Mourning and Entreaty (1:2–2:17)</h3>

<h4>Lament over the ruin of the country (1:2–12)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Listen to this, you elders;</span><br />
	<span>everybody in the country, attend!</span><br />
	<span>Has anything like this ever happened in your day,</span><br />
	<span>or in your ancestors’ days?</span><br />
	<span>Tell your children about it</span><br />
	<span>and let your children tell their children,</span><br />
	<span>and their children the next generation!</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>What the nibbler has left, the grown locust has eaten,</span><br />
	<span>what the grown locust has left, the hopper has eaten,</span><br />
	<span>and what the hopper has left, the shearer has eaten.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Wake up, you drunkards, and weep!</span><br />
	<span>All you wine-bibbers, lament</span><br />
	<span>for the new wine: it has been snatched from your lips.</span><br />
	<span>For a nation has invaded my country,</span><br />
	<span>mighty and innumerable,</span><br />
	<span>with teeth like a lion’s teeth,</span><br />
	<span>with the fangs of a lioness.</span><br />
	<span>It has reduced my vines to a desolation</span><br />
	<span>and my fig trees to splinters,</span><br />
	<span>stripped them and broken them down,</span><br />
	<span>leaving their branches white.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Mourn, as a virgin-bride in sackcloth</span><br />
	<span>for the bridegroom of her youth!</span><br />
	<span>Cereal offering and libation</span><br />
	<span>are lost to Yahweh’s Temple.</span><br />
	<span>The priests, the ministers of Yahweh,</span><br />
	<span>are in mourning.</span><br />
	<span>The fields are ruined,</span><br />
	<span>the land is in mourning,</span><br />
	<span>for the grain has been ruined,</span><br />
	<span>the new wine has failed,</span><br />
	<span>of olive oil only a trickle.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Stand dismayed, you farmers,</span><br />
	<span>wail, you vinedressers,</span><br />
	<span>for the wheat, for the barley!</span><br />
	<span>The harvest of the fields has been lost!</span><br />
	<span>The vine has withered,</span><br />
	<span>the fig tree wilts away;</span><br />
	<span>pomegranate, palm tree, apple tree,</span><br />
	<span>every tree in the countryside is dry,</span><br />
	<span>and for human beings</span><br />
	<span>joy has run dry too.</span><br />
</p>

<h4>A call to repentance and prayer (1:13–20)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Priests, put on sackcloth and lament!</span><br />
	<span>You ministers of the altar, wail!</span><br />
	<span>Come here, lie in sackcloth all night long,</span><br />
	<span>you ministers of my God!</span><br />
	<span>For the Temple of your God has been deprived</span><br />
	<span>of cereal offering and libation.</span><br />
	<span>Order a fast,</span><br />
	<span>proclaim a solemn assembly;</span><br />
	<span>you elders, summon</span><br />
	<span>everybody in the country</span><br />
	<span>to the Temple of Yahweh your God.</span><br />
	<span>Cry out to Yahweh:</span><br />
	<span>“Alas for the day!</span><br />
	<span>For the Day of Yahweh is near,</span><br />
	<span>coming as destruction from Shaddai”.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Has not the food disappeared</span><br />
	<span>before our very eyes?</span><br />
	<span>Have not joy and gladness vanished</span><br />
	<span>from the Temple of our God?</span><br />
	<span>The seeds shrivel under their clods;</span><br />
	<span>the granaries are deserted,</span><br />
	<span>the barns are in ruins,</span><br />
	<span>because the harvest has dried out.</span><br />
	<span>Loudly the cattle groan!</span><br />
	<span>The herds of oxen are bewildered</span><br />
	<span>because they have no pasture.</span><br />
	<span>The flocks of sheep bear the punishment too.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Yahweh, to you I cry:</span><br />
	<span>for fire has devoured the desert pastures,</span><br />
	<span>flame has burnt up all the trees in the countryside.</span><br />
	<span>Even the wild animals pant loudly for you,</span><br />
	<span>for the watercourses have run dry,</span><br />
	<span>and fire has devoured the desert pastures.</span>
</p>

<h4>A warning about the Day of Yahweh (2:1–2)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Blow the ram’s-horn in Zion,</span><br />
	<span>sound the alarm on my holy mountain!</span><br />
	<span>Let everybody in the country tremble,</span><br />
	<span>for the Day of Yahweh is coming,</span><br />
	<span>yes, it is near.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Day of darkness and gloom,</span><br />
	<span>Day of cloud and blackness.</span><br />
	<span>Like the dawn, across the mountains</span><br />
	<span>spreads a vast and mighty people,</span><br />
	<span>such as has never been before,</span><br />
	<span>such as will never be again</span><br />
	<span>to the remotest ages.</span>
</p>

<h4>The invasion of locusts (2:3–9)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>In their van a fire devours,</span><br />
	<span>in their rear a flame consumes.</span><br />
	<span>The country is like a garden of Eden ahead of them</span><br />
	<span>and a desert waste behind them.</span><br />
	<span>Nothing escapes them.</span><br />
	<span>They look like horses,</span><br />
	<span>like chargers they gallop on,</span><br />
	<span>with a racket like that of chariots</span><br />
	<span>they spring over the mountain tops,</span><br />
	<span>with a crackling like a blazing fire</span><br />
	<span>devouring the stubble,</span><br />
	<span>a mighty army in battle array.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>At the sight of them, people are appalled</span><br />
	<span>and every face grows pale.</span><br />
	<span>Like fighting men they press forward,</span><br />
	<span>like warriors they scale the walls,</span><br />
	<span>each marching straight ahead,</span><br />
	<span>not turning from his path;</span><br />
	<span>they never jostle each other,</span><br />
	<span>each marches straight ahead:</span><br />
	<span>arrows fly, they still press forward,</span><br />
	<span>never breaking ranks.</span><br />
	<span>They hurl themselves at the city,</span><br />
	<span>they leap onto the walls,</span><br />
	<span>swarm up the houses,</span><br />
	<span>getting in through the windows</span><br />
	<span>like thieves.</span>
</p>

<h4>A vision of the Day of Yahweh (2:10–11)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>As they come on, the earth quakes,</span><br />
	<span>the skies tremble,</span><br />
	<span>sun and moon grow dark,</span><br />
	<span>the stars lose their brilliance.</span><br />
	<span>Yahweh’s voice rings out</span><br />
	<span>at the head of his troops!</span><br />
	<span>For mighty indeed is his army,</span><br />
	<span>strong, the enforcer of his orders,</span><br />
	<span>for great is the Day of Yahweh,</span><br />
	<span>and very terrible — who can face it?</span>
</p>

<h4>A call to repentance (2:12–17)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>“But now — declares Yahweh —</span><br />
	<span>come back to me with all your heart,</span><br />
	<span>fasting, weeping, mourning”.</span><br />
	<span>Tear your hearts and not your clothes,</span><br />
	<span>and come back to Yahweh your God,</span><br />
	<span>for he is gracious and compassionate,</span><br />
	<span>slow to anger, rich in faithful love,</span><br />
	<span>and he relents about inflicting disaster.</span><br />
	<span>Who knows if he will not come back, relent</span><br />
	<span>and leave a blessing behind him,</span><br />
	<span>a cereal offering and a libation</span><br />
	<span>to be presented to Yahweh your God?</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Blow the ram’s-horn in Zion!</span><br />
	<span>Order a fast,</span><br />
	<span>proclaim a solemn assembly,</span><br />
	<span>call the people together,</span><br />
	<span>summon the community,</span><br />
	<span>assemble the elders,</span><br />
	<span>gather the children,</span><br />
	<span>even infants at the breast!</span><br />
	<span>Call the bridegroom from his bedroom</span><br />
	<span>and the bride from her bower!</span><br />
	<span>Let the priests, the ministers of Yahweh,</span><br />
	<span>stand weeping between portico and altar,</span><br />
	<span>saying, “Spare your people, Yahweh!</span><br />
	<span>Do not expose your heritage to the contempt,</span><br />
	<span>to the sarcasm of the nations!</span><br />
	<span>Why give the peoples cause to say,</span><br />
	<span>‘Where is their God?’”.</span>
</p>

<h3 id="ib">B: Yahweh’s Answer (2:18–27)</h3>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Then, becoming jealous over his country,</span><br />
	<span>Yahweh took pity on his people.</span>
</p>

<h4>The plague stops (2:19–20)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Yahweh said in answer to his people,</span><br />
	<span>“Now I shall send you</span><br />
	<span>wheat, wine and olive oil</span><br />
	<span>until you have enough.</span><br />
	<span>Never again will I expose you</span><br />
	<span>to the contempt of the nations.</span><br />
	<span>I shall take the northerner far away from you</span><br />
	<span>and drive him into an arid, desolate land,</span><br />
	<span>his vanguard to the eastern sea,</span><br />
	<span>his rearguard to the western sea.</span><br />
	<span>He will give off a stench,</span><br />
	<span>he will give off a foul stink</span><br />
	<span>(for what he made bold to do)”.</span>
</p>

<h4>A vision of plenty (2:21–27)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Land, do not be afraid;</span><br />
	<span>be glad, rejoice,</span><br />
	<span>for Yahweh has done great things.</span><br />
	<span>Wild animals, do not be afraid;</span><br />
	<span>the desert pastures are green again,</span><br />
	<span>the trees bear fruit,</span><br />
	<span>vine and fig tree yield their richness.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Sons of Zion, be glad,</span><br />
	<span>rejoice in Yahweh your God;</span><br />
	<span>for he has given you</span><br />
	<span>autumn rain as justice demands,</span><br />
	<span>and he will send the rains down for you,</span><br />
	<span>the autumn and spring rain as of old.</span><br />
	<span>The threshing-floors will be full of grain,</span><br />
	<span>the vats overflow with wine and oil.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>“I will make up to you for the years</span><br />
	<span>devoured by grown locust and hopper,</span><br />
	<span>by shearer and young locust,</span><br />
	<span>my great army</span><br />
	<span>which I sent to invade you.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>“You will eat to your heart’s content,</span><br />
	<span>and praise the name of Yahweh your God</span><br />
	<span>who has treated you so wonderfully.</span><br />
	<span>(My people will never be humiliated again!)</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>“And you will know that I am among you in Israel,</span><br />
	<span>I, Yahweh your God, and no one else.</span><br />
	<span>My people will never be humiliated again!”.</span>
</p>

<h2 id="ii">II: The New Age and the Day of Yahweh (3:1–4:21)</h2>

<h3 id="iia">A: The outpouring of the Spirit (3:1–5)</h3>

<p class="poem">
	<span>“After this</span><br />
	<span>I shall pour out my spirit on all humanity.</span><br />
	<span>Your sons and daughters shall prophesy,</span><br />
	<span>your old people shall dream dreams,</span><br />
	<span>and your young people see visions.</span><br />
	<span>Even on the slaves, men and women,</span><br />
	<span>shall I pour out my spirit in those days.</span><br />
	<span>I shall show portents in the sky and on earth,</span><br />
	<span>blood and fire and columns of smoke”.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The sun will be turned into darkness,</span><br />
	<span>and the moon into blood,</span><br />
	<span>before the Day comes,</span><br />
	<span>that great and terrible Day.</span><br />
	<span>All who call on the name of Yahweh will be saved,</span><br />
	<span>for on Mount Zion will be those who have escaped,</span><br />
	<span>as Yahweh has said,</span><br />
	<span>and in Jerusalem a remnant whom Yahweh is calling.</span>
</p>

<h3 id="iib">B: The Judgement of the Nations (4:1–21)</h3>

<h4>The judgement announced (4:1–3)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>“For in those days and at that time,</span><br />
	<span>when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,</span><br />
	<span>I shall gather all the nations together</span><br />
	<span>and take them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat;</span><br />
	<span>there I shall put them on trial</span><br />
	<span>because of Israel, my people and my heritage,</span><br />
	<span>for having scattered them among the nations</span><br />
	<span>and having divided my land among themselves.</span><br />
	<span>They drew lots for my people,</span><br />
	<span>bartering a boy for a whore</span><br />
	<span>and selling a girl for wine to drink.</span>
</p>

<h4>Charges against the Phoenicians and Philistines (4:4–8)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>“And what are you to me, Tyre and Sidon</span><br />
	<span>and all you regions of Philistia?</span><br />
	<span>Can you take revenge on me?</span><br />
	<span>If you take revenge on me,</span><br />
	<span>I shall quickly, instantly, make your revenge recoil on your own heads</span><br />
	<span>for having taken my silver and gold away</span><br />
	<span>and carried off my valuable treasures to your temples,</span><br />
	<span>and for having sold the children of Judah and Jerusalem to the lonians,</span><br />
	<span>to be taken far away from their own frontiers.</span><br />
	<span>Look, I shall rouse them from the places to which you have sold them;</span><br />
	<span>I shall make your actions recoil on your own heads</span><br />
	<span>by selling your sons and daughters</span><br />
	<span>to the sons of Judah,</span><br />
	<span>who in turn will sell them to the Sabaeans,</span><br />
	<span>to a nation far away —</span><br />
	<span>Yahweh has spoken!”.</span>
</p>

<h4>A summons to the nations (4:9–14)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Proclaim this among the nations.</span><br />
	<span>Prepare for war!</span><br />
	<span>Rouse the champions!</span><br />
	<span>All you troops, advance,</span><br />
	<span>march!</span><br />
	<span>Hammer your ploughshares into swords,</span><br />
	<span>your bill-hooks into spears;</span><br />
	<span>let the weakling say, “I am tough!”.</span><br />
	<span>Hurry and come,</span><br />
	<span>all the nations around,</span><br />
	<span>and assemble there!</span><br />
	<span>(Yahweh, send down your champions!)</span><br />
	<span>“Let the nations rouse themselves and march</span><br />
	<span>to the Valley of Jehoshaphat,</span><br />
	<span>for there I shall sit in judgement</span><br />
	<span>on all the nations around.</span><br />
	<span>Ply the sickle,</span><br />
	<span>for the harvest is ripe;</span><br />
	<span>come and tread,</span><br />
	<span>for the winepress is full;</span><br />
	<span>the vats are overflowing,</span><br />
	<span>so great is their wickedness!”.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Multitude on multitude</span><br />
	<span>in the Valley of Decision!</span><br />
	<span>For the Day of Yahweh is near</span><br />
	<span>in the Valley of the Verdict!</span>
</p>

<h4>The Day of Yahweh (4:15–17)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Sun and moon grow dark,</span><br />
	<span>the stars lose their brilliance.</span><br />
	<span>Yahweh roars from Zion,</span><br />
	<span>he thunders from Jerusalem;</span><br />
	<span>heaven and earth tremble.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>But Yahweh will be a shelter for his people,</span><br />
	<span>a stronghold for the Israelites.</span>

<p class="poem">
	<span>“Then you will know that I am Yahweh your God</span><br />

</p>

<h3 id="iic">C: The Glorious Future of Israel (4:18–21)</h3>

<p class="poem">
	<span>When that Day comes,</span><br />
	<span>the mountains will run with new wine</span><br />
	<span>and the hills will flow with milk,</span><br />
	<span>and all the stream-beds of Judah</span><br />
	<span>will run with water.</span><br />
	<span>A fountain will spring from Yahweh’s Temple</span><br />
	<span>and water the Gorge of the Acacias.</span><br />
	<span>Egypt will become a desolation,</span><br />
	<span>and Edom a desert waste</span><br />
	<span>on account of the violence done to the children of Judah</span><br />
	<span>whose innocent blood they shed in their country.</span><br />
	<span>But Judah will be inhabited for ever,</span><br />
	<span>and Jerusalem from generation to generation!</span><br />
	<span>“I shall avenge their blood and let none go unpunished”,</span><br />
	<span>and Yahweh will dwell in Zion.</span>
