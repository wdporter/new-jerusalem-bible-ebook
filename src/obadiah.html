<h4>Title (1a)</h4>

<p>Vision of Obadiah: about Edom.</p>

<h4>Prologue (1c)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>I have received a message from Yahweh,</span><br />
	<span>a herald has been sent throughout the nations:</span><br />
	<span>“Up! Let us march against this people.</span><br />
	<span>Into battle!”.</span>
</p>

<h4>Sentence pronounced on Edom (1b; 2–4)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The Lord Yahweh says this:</span><br />
	<span>Look, I have reduced you to the smallest of nations,</span><br />
	<span>you are now beneath contempt.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Your proud heart has misled you,</span><br />
	<span>you whose home is in the crannies of the Rock,</span><br />
	<span>who make the heights your dwelling,</span><br />
	<span>who think to yourself,</span><br />
	<span>“Who can bring me down to earth?”.</span><br />
	<span>Though you soar like an eagle,</span><br />
	<span>though you set your nest among the stars,</span><br />
	<span>I shall bring you down from there! — declares Yahweh.</span>
</p>

<h4>The annihilation of Edom (5–9)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>If thieves were to come to you</span><br />
	<span>(or robbers during the night)</span><br />
	<span>surely they would steal only as much as they wanted?</span><br />
	<span>If grape-pickers were to come to you,</span><br />
	<span>surely they would leave a few gleanings?</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>But how you have been pillaged!</span><br />
	<span>How Esau has been looted,</span><br />
	<span>his hidden treasures routed out!</span><br />
	<span>Your allies all pursued you right to the frontier,</span><br />
	<span>your confederates kept you in suspense,</span><br />
	<span>then got the better of you,</span><br />
	<span>your own guests laid a trap for you,</span><br />
	<span>“He has quite lost his wits”.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>When that day comes — declares Yahweh —</span><br />
	<span>shall I not eliminate sages from Edom</span><br />
	<span>and intelligence from Mount Esau?</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Your warriors, Teman, will be so demoralised</span><br />
	<span>that the people of Mount Esau will be massacred</span><br />
	<span>to the last one.</span>
</p> 

<h4>The guilt of Edom (10–15)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>For the slaughter, for the violence</span><br />
	<span>done to your brother Jacob,</span><br />
	<span>shame will cover you</span><br />
	<span>and you will be annihilated for ever.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>On the day, when you stood aloof</span><br />
	<span>while strangers carried off his riches,</span><br />
	<span>while foreigners passed through his gate</span><br />
	<span>and cast lots for Jerusalem,</span><br />
	<span>you were as bad as the rest of them.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not feast your eyes on your brother</span><br />
	<span>on the day of his misfortune.</span><br />
	<span>Do not gloat over the children of Judah</span><br />
	<span>on the day of their ruin.</span><br />
	<span>Do not play the braggart</span><br />
	<span>on the day of distress.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not enter my people’s gate</span><br />
	<span>on their day of calamity.</span><br />
	<span>Do not, you especially, feast your eyes on their suffering</span><br />
	<span>on their day of calamity.</span><br />
	<span>Do not touch their possessions</span><br />
	<span>on their day of calamity.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Do not wait at the crossroads</span><br />
	<span>to annihilate their fugitives.</span><br />
	<span>Do not hand over their survivors</span><br />
	<span>on the day of distress.</span><br />
	<span>For the Day of Yahweh is near</span><br />
	<span>for all the nations.</span><br />
	<span>As you have done, so will it be done to you:</span><br />
	<span>your deeds will recoil on your own head.</span>
</p>

<h4>The Day of Yahweh. Israel revenged on Edom (16–18)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Just as you have drunk on my holy mountain,</span><br />
	<span>so will all the nations drink continually,</span><br />
	<span>they will drink, will drink greedily,</span><br />
	<span>but they will be as though they had never been!</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>But on Mount Zion will be those who have escaped</span><br />
	<span>— it will be a sanctuary —</span><br />
	<span>and the House of Jacob will recover</span><br />
	<span>what is rightfully theirs.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Then the House of Jacob will be a fire,</span><br />
	<span>the House of Joseph a flame,</span><br />
	<span>and the House of Esau like stubble.</span><br />
	<span>They will set it alight and burn it up,</span><br />
	<span>and no one of the House of Esau will survive.</span><br />
	<span>Yahweh has spoken.</span>
</p>

<h4>The new Israel (19–21)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>People from the Negeb will occupy the Mount of Esau,</span><br />
	<span>people from the lowlands the country of the Philistines;</span><br />
	<span>they will occupy Ephraim and Samaria,</span><br />
	<span>and Benjamin will occupy Gilead.</span><br />
	<span>The exiles of this army, the sons of Israel,</span><br />
	<span>will have the Canaanites’ land as far as Zarephthah,</span><br />
	<span>while the exiles from Jerusalem now in Sepharad</span><br />
	<span>will have the cities of the Negeb.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Victorious, they will climb Mount Zion</span><br />
	<span>to rule over Mount Esau,</span><br />
	<span>and sovereignty will be Yahweh’s!</span>
</p>
