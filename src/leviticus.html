Lev 1:1 Yahweh summoned Moses and, speaking to him from the Tent of Meeting, said, 

Lev 1 :2 “Speak to the Israelites; say to them, ‘When any of you brings an offering to Yahweh, he can offer an 
animal either from the herd or from the flock. 

Lev 1 :3 ‘If his offering is to be a burnt offering from the herd, he must offer an unblemished male; he will offer it 
at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, to make it acceptable to Yahweh. 

Lev 1 :4 He must lay his hand on the victim’s head, and it will be accepted as effectual for his expiation. 

Lev 1 :5 He will then slaughter the bull before Yahweh, and the priests descended from Aaron will offer the 
blood. They will pour it all around the altar which stands at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 

Lev 1 :6 He will then skin the victim and quarter it. 

Lev 1 :7 The priests descended from Aaron will put a fire on the altar and arrange wood on the fire. 

Lev 1 :8 The priests descended from Aaron will then arrange the quarters, the head and the fat on the wood on 
the fire on the altar. 

Lev 1 :9 He will wash the entrails and shins in water, and the priest will burn it all on the altar as a burnt offering, 
food burnt as a smell pleasing to Yahweh. 

Lev 1:10 ‘If his offering is to be of an animal from the flock, of a lamb or a goat to be offered as a burnt offering, 
he must offer an unblemished male. 

Lev 1:11 He will slaughter it on the north side of the altar, before Yahweh, and the priests descended from 
Aaron will pour the blood all around the altar. 

Lev 1:12 He will then quarter it, and the priest will arrange the quarters, the head and the fat on the wood on the 
fire on the altar. 



Lev 1:13 He will wash the entrails and shins in water, and the priest will burn it all on the altar as a burnt 
offering, food burnt as a smell pleasing to Yahweh. 

Lev 1:14 ‘If his offering to Yahweh is to be a burnt offering of a bird, he must offer a turtledove or a young 
pigeon. 

Lev 1:15 The priest will offer it at the altar and wring off its head, which he will burn on the altar; its blood must 
then be squeezed out on the side of the altar. 

Lev 1:16 He will then remove the crop and the feathers and throw them on the eastern side of the altar, where 
the fatty ashes are put. 

Lev 1:17 He will then split it in half with a wing on each side, but without separating the two parts. The priest will 
then burn it on the altar, on the wood which is on the fire, as a burnt offering, food burnt as a smell pleasing to 
Yahweh’”. 

Lev 2:1 “‘If anyone offers Yahweh a cereal offering, his offering must consist of wheaten flour on which he must 
pour wine and put incense. 

Lev 2:2 He will bring it to the priests descended from Aaron; he will take a handful of the wheaten flour, some of 
the oil and all the incense, and this the priest will burn on the altar as a memorial, as food burnt as a smell 
pleasing to Yahweh. 

Lev 2:3 The remainder of the cereal offering will revert to Aaron and his sons, an especially holy portion of the 
food burnt for Yahweh. 

Lev 2:4 ‘When you offer a cereal offering of dough baked in the oven, the wheaten flour must be prepared 
either in the form of unleavened cakes mixed with oil, or in the form of unleavened wafers spread with oil. 

Lev 2:5 ‘If your offering is a cereal offering cooked on the griddle, the wheaten flour mixed with oil must contain 
no leaven. 

Lev 2:6 You will break it in pieces and pour oil over it. It is a cereal offering. 

Lev 2:7 ‘If your offering is a cereal offering cooked in the pan, the wheaten flour must be prepared with oil. 

Lev 2:8 ‘You will bring Yahweh the cereal offering thus prepared and present it to the priest; he will take it to the 
altar. 

Lev 2:9 And from the cereal offering the priest will take the memorial and burn it on the altar, food burnt as a 
smell pleasing to Yahweh. 

Lev 2:10 The remainder of the cereal offering will revert to Aaron and his descendants: it is especially holy since 
it is taken from the food burnt for Yahweh. 

Lev 2:11 ‘None of the cereal offerings which you offer to Yahweh must be prepared with leaven, for you must 
never include leaven or honey in food burnt for Yahweh. 

Lev 2:12 You may offer them to Yahweh as an offering of first-fruits, but they will not make a pleasing smell if 
they are burnt on the altar. 

Lev 2:13 You will put salt in every cereal offering that you offer, and you will not fail to put the salt of the 
covenant of your God on your cereal offering; to every offering you will add an offering of salt to your God. 

Lev 2:14 If you offer Yahweh a cereal offering of first-fruits, you will offer it in the form of roasted ears of wheat 
or of bread made from ground wheat. 

Lev 2:15 You will add oil to it and put incense on it; it is a cereal offering; 

Lev 2:16 and from it the priest will burn the memorial with some bread and oil (and all the incense) as food burnt 
for Yahweh’”. 

Lev 3:1 “‘If his sacrifice is a communion sacrifice, and if he offers an animal from the herd, be it male or female, 
whatever he offers before Yahweh must be unblemished. 

Lev 3:2 He will lay his hand on the victim’s head and slaughter it at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. The 
priests descended from Aaron will then pour the blood all around the altar. 

Lev 3:3 He will offer part of the communion sacrifice as food burnt for Yahweh: the fat covering the entrails, all 
the fat on the entrails, 

Lev 3:4 both kidneys, the fat on them and on the loins, the mass of fat which he will remove from the liver and 
kidneys. 

Lev 3:5 The priests descended from Aaron will then burn this on the altar, in addition to the burnt offering, on the 
wood of the fire, food burnt as a smell pleasing to Yahweh. 

Lev 3:6 ‘If it is an animal from the flock which he offers as a communion sacrifice to Yahweh, be the animal that 
he offers male or female, it must be unblemished. 

Lev 3:7 ‘If he offers a sheep, he will offer it before Yahweh, 

Lev 3:8 he will lay his hand on the victim’s head and slaughter it in front of the Tent of Meeting; the priests 
descended from Aaron will then pour its blood all around the altar. 

Lev 3:9 Of the communion sacrifice he will offer the following as food burnt for Yahweh: the fat, all the tail taken 
off near the base of the spine, the fat covering the entrails, all the fat on the entrails, 

Lev 3:10 both kidneys, the fat on them and on the loins, the mass of fat which he will remove from the liver and 



kidneys. 

Lev 3:11 The priest will then burn this on the altar as food, as food burnt for Yahweh. 

Lev 3:12 ‘If his offering is a goat, he will offer it before Yahweh, 

Lev 3:13 he will lay his hand on the victim’s head and slaughter it in front of the Tent of Meeting, and the 
descendants of Aaron will then pour its blood all around the altar. 

Lev 3:14 This is what he will then offer of it as food burnt for Yahweh: the fat covering the entrails, all the fat on 
the entrails, 

Lev 3:15 both kidneys, the fat on them and on the loins, the mass of fat which he will remove from the liver and 
kidneys. 

Lev 3:16 The priest will then burn these pieces on the altar as food burnt as a smell pleasing to Yahweh. ‘All the 
fat belongs to Yahweh. 

Lev 3:17 This is a perpetual law for all your descendants, wherever you may live: that you will not eat either fat 
or blood’”. 

Lev 4:1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: 

Lev 4:2 “Speak to the Israelites and say: ‘If anyone sins inadvertently against any of Yahweh’s commandments 
and does anything prohibited by them, 

Lev 4:3 if the one who sins is the anointed priest, thus making the people guilty, then for the sin which he has 
committed he must offer Yahweh a young bull, an unblemished animal from the herd, as a sacrifice for sin. 

Lev 4:4 He will bring the bull before Yahweh at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, will lay his hand on its head 
and slaughter it before Yahweh. 

Lev 4:5 The anointed priest will then take some of the bull’s blood and carry it into the Tent of Meeting. 

Lev 4:6 He will then dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times in front of the sanctuary curtain, before 
Yahweh. 

Lev 4:7 The priest will then put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of incense smoking before Yahweh in 
the Tent of Meeting, and will pour all the rest of the bull’s blood at the foot of the altar of burnt offerings at the 
entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 

Lev 4:8 ‘Of the bull offered as a sacrifice for sin, he will set aside all the fat: the fat covering the entrails, all the 
fat on the entrails, 

Lev 4:9 both kidneys, the fat on them and on the loins, the mass of fat which he will remove from the liver and 
kidneys- 

Lev 4:10 exactly as was done with the portion set aside in the communion sacrifice — and the priest will burn 
these pieces on the altar of burnt offerings. 

Lev 4:11 ‘The bull’s skin and all its meat, its head, its shins, its entrails and its offal, 

Lev 4:12 the whole bull he will then have carried out of the camp to a clean place, the place where the fatty 
ashes are thrown, and will burn it on a wood fire; it must be burnt where the ashes are thrown. 

Lev 4:13 ‘If the whole community of Israel has sinned inadvertently and, without being aware of it has incurred 
guilt by doing something forbidden by Yahweh’s commandments, 

Lev 4:14 once the sin of which it is guilty has been discovered, the community must offer a young bull, an 
unblemished animal from the herd, as a sacrifice for sin, and bring it in front of the Tent of Meeting. 

Lev 4:15 The elders of the community will then lay their hands on the bull’s head before Yahweh, and the bull 
will be slaughtered before Yahweh. 

Lev 4:16 ‘The anointed priest will then take some of the bull’s blood into the Tent of Meeting. 

Lev 4:17 He will then dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times in front of the curtain, before 
Yahweh. 

Lev 4:18 He will then put some of the blood on the horns of the altar standing before Yahweh inside the Tent of 
Meeting, and then pour all the rest of the blood at the foot of the altar of burnt offerings at the entrance to the 
Tent of Meeting. 

Lev 4:19 ‘He will then set aside all the fat from the animal and burn it on the altar. 

Lev 4:20 He will then deal with the bull as he did with the bull in the sacrifice for sin. It will be dealt with in the 
same way; and once the priest has performed the rite of expiation for the people, they will be forgiven. 

Lev 4:21 ‘He will then have the bull carried out of the camp and will burn it as he burned the first one. This is the 
sacrifice for the sin of the community. 

Lev 4:22 ‘When a leader has sinned and inadvertently incurred guilt by doing something forbidden by the 
commandments of Yahweh his God 

Lev 4:23 (or if the sin which he has committed is drawn to his attention), he must bring a he-goat as his offering, 
an unblemished male. 

Lev 4:24 He will then lay his hand on the goat’s head and slaughter it on the spot where the burnt offerings are 
slaughtered before Yahweh. This is a sacrifice for sin; 

Lev 4:25 the priest will take some of the victim’s blood on his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt 



offerings. He will then pour the rest of its blood at the foot of the altar of burnt offerings 

Lev 4:26 and burn all the fat on the altar, as with the fat in the communion sacrifice. This is how the priest must 
perform the rite of expiation for him to free him from his sin, and he will be forgiven. 

Lev 4:27 ‘If one of the country people sins inadvertently and incurs guilt by doing something forbidden by 
Yahweh’s commandments 

Lev 4:28 (or if the sin which he has committed is drawn to his attention), he must bring a she-goat as his offering 
for the sin which he has committed, an unblemished female. 

Lev 4:29 He will then lay his hand on the victim’s head and slaughter it on the spot where the burnt offerings are 
slaughtered. 

Lev 4:30 The priest will take some of its blood on his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offerings. 
He will then pour all the rest of the blood at the foot of the altar. 

Lev 4:31 He will then remove all the fat, as the fat was removed for the communion sacrifice, and the priest will 
burn it on the altar as a smell pleasing to Yahweh. This is how the priest must perform the rite of expiation for 
him, and he will be forgiven. 

Lev 4:32 ‘If he wishes to bring a lamb as an offering for this kind of sacrifice, he must bring an unblemished 
female. 

Lev 4:33 He will then lay his hand on the victim’s head and slaughter it as a sacrifice for sin on the spot where 
the burnt offerings are slaughtered. 

Lev 4:34 The priest will take some of the victim’s blood on his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt 
offerings. He will then pour all the rest of the blood at the foot of the altar. 

Lev 4:35 He will then remove all the fat, as was done for the sheep in the communion sacrifice, and the priest 
will burn it as food burnt for Yahweh. This is how the priest must perform for him the rite of expiation for the sin 
which he has committed, and he will be forgiven’”. 

Lev 5:1 “‘If someone sins in any of these following cases: ‘He should have come forward to give evidence when 
he heard the formal adjuration, having seen the incident or known the facts; but he has not spoken out, and so 
bears the consequences of his guilt; 

Lev 5:2 ‘or someone touches something unclean, whatever it may be — the dead body of an unclean animal, 
wild or tame, or of one of the unclean reptiles — and without realising it becomes unclean, he becomes 
answerable for it; 

Lev 5:3 ‘or he touches some human uncleanness, whatever it may be, contact with which makes him unclean; 
he does not notice it, then, realising it later, he becomes answerable for it; 

Lev 5:4 ‘or someone lets slip an oath to do something either evil or good, in any of those matters on which 
someone may let slip an oath; he does not notice it, then, realising it later, he becomes answerable for it; 

Lev 5:5 ‘if he is answerable in any of those cases, he will have to confess the sin committed. 

Lev 5:6 As a sacrifice of reparation for the sin committed, he will bring Yahweh a female from the flock (sheep or 
goat) as a sacrifice for sin; and the priest will perform the rite of expiation for him to free him from his sin. 

Lev 5:7 ‘If he cannot afford an animal from the flock as a sacrifice of reparation for the sin he has committed, he 
will bring Yahweh two turtledoves or two young pigeons — one as a sacrifice for sin and the other as a burnt 
offering. 

Lev 5:8 He will bring them to the priest who will first offer the one intended for the sacrifice for sin. The priest will 
wring its neck but not remove the head. 

Lev 5:9 He will sprinkle the side of the altar with the victim’s blood, and then squeeze out the rest of the blood at 
the foot of the altar. This is a sacrifice for sin. 

Lev 5:10 He will then offer the other bird as a burnt offering according to the ritual. This is how the priest must 
perform the rite of expiation for the person for the sin he has committed, and he will be forgiven. 

Lev 5:11 ‘If he cannot afford two turtledoves or two young pigeons, he will bring a tenth of an ephah of wheaten 
flour as an offering for the sin committed; he must not mix oil with it or put incense on it, since this is a sacrifice 
for sin. 

Lev 5:12 He will bring it to the priest, who will take a handful of it as a memorial, and burn this on the altar in 
addition to the offerings of food burnt for Yahweh. This is a sacrifice for sin. 

Lev 5:13 This is how the priest must perform the rite of expiation for the person for the sin he has committed in 
any of those cases, and he will be forgiven. In this case, the priest has the same rights as in the case of a cereal 
offering’”. 

Lev 5:14 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: 

Lev 5:15 “If someone is unfaithful and sins inadvertently by infringing Yahweh’s sacred rights, as a sacrifice of 
reparation he must bring Yahweh an unblemished ram from his flock, the value of which will be decided by you 
in silver shekels according to the rate of the sanctuary-shekel. 

Lev 5:16 He will make amends for what his sin subtracted from the sacred rights, adding one-fifth to the value, 
and give it to the priest. The priest will then perform the rite of expiation for him with the ram for the sacrifice of 



reparation and he will be forgiven. 

Lev 5:17 “If someone sins and without realising it does one of the things forbidden by Yahweh’s 
commandments, he will answer for it and bear the consequences of his guilt. 

Lev 5:18 As a sacrifice of reparation he must bring the priest an unblemished ram from his flock to the value 
which you decide, and the priest will perform the rite of expiation for him for the oversight unwittingly committed, 
and he will be forgiven. 

Lev 5:19 This is a sacrifice of reparation; the man was certainly answerable to Yahweh”. 

Lev 5:20 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: 

Lev 5:21 “If someone sins and is unfaithful against Yahweh by deceiving his fellow-countryman over a deposit or 
a security, or by withholding something due to him or by exploiting him; 

Lev 5:22 “or if he finds lost property and denies it; “or if he perjures himself about anything that a human being 
may do criminally in such matters; 

Lev 5:23 “if he sins and so becomes answerable, he must restore what he has taken or demanded in excess: 
the deposit confided to him, the lost property that he has found, 

Lev 5:24 or any object about which he has perjured himself. He will add one-fifth to the principal and pay the 
whole to the person who held the property rights on the day when he incurred the guilt. 

Lev 5:25 He will then bring Yahweh an unblemished ram from his flock to the value which you decide, to the 
priest as a sacrifice of reparation, 

Lev 5:26 and the priest will perform the rite of expiation for him before Yahweh and he will be forgiven, whatever 
the act by which he incurred guilt”. 

Lev 6:1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: 

Lev 6:2 “Give these orders to Aaron and his sons: ‘This is the ritual for the burnt offering (that is, the burnt 
offering that stays on the altar brazier all night until morning and is consumed by the altar fire). 

Lev 6:3 ‘The priest will put on his linen tunic and put his linen drawers on to cover himself. He will then remove 
the fatty ashes of the burnt offering consumed by the altar fire and put them at the side of the altar. 

Lev 6:4 He will then take off his clothes, put on others and carry the ashes to a clean place outside the camp. 
Lev 6:5 ‘The fire on the altar that consumes the burnt offering must not be allowed to go out. Every morning the 
priest will make it up with wood, arranging the burnt offering on it and burning the fat from the communion 
sacrifices. 

Lev 6:6 The fire must always be burning on the altar; it must never go out. 

Lev 6:7 “This is the ritual for the cereal offering: ‘One of the descendants of Aaron will bring it into Yahweh’s 
presence in front of the altar, 

Lev 6:8 will take a handful of the wheaten flour (with the oil and all the incense which have been added to it) and 
burn the memorial on the altar as a smell pleasing to Yahweh; 

Lev 6:9 and Aaron and his sons will eat the remainder in the form of unleavened loaves. They will eat it inside 
the holy place, in the court of the Tent of Meeting. 

Lev 6:10 The portion I give them of the food burnt for me must not be baked with leaven; it is especially holy, 
like the sacrifice for sin and the sacrifice of reparation. 

Lev 6:11 All male descendants of Aaron are entitled to eat this portion of the food burnt for Yahweh (this is a 
perpetual law for all your descendants) and anyone who touches it will become holy’”. 

Lev 6:12 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: 

Lev 6:13 “This is the offering that Aaron and his sons must make to Yahweh on the day they are anointed: one- 
tenth of an ephah of wheaten flour as a perpetual cereal offering, half in the morning and half in the evening. 

Lev 6:14 It will be prepared on the griddle and mixed with oil; you will bring the paste as a cereal offering in 
several pieces, offering them as a smell pleasing to Yahweh. 

Lev 6:15 When one of his sons is anointed priest to succeed him, he will do the same. This is a perpetual law. 
“The entire cereal offering will be burnt for Yahweh. 

Lev 6:16 Every cereal offering made by a priest will be a total sacrifice; none of it will be eaten”. 

Lev 6:17 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, 

Lev 6:18 “Speak to Aaron and his sons and say: ‘This is the ritual for the sacrifice for sin: ‘The victim must be 
slaughtered before Yahweh on the spot where the burnt offerings are slaughtered. It is especially holy. 

Lev 6:19 The priest who offers this sacrifice will eat it. It will be eaten inside the holy place, in the court of the 
Tent of Meeting. 

Lev 6:20 Everything touching the victim’s meat will become holy, and if any of the blood splashes on clothing, 
the stain will be washed off inside the holy place. 

Lev 6:21 The earthenware vessel in which the meat is cooked must be broken; if a bronze vessel has been 
used for the cooking, it must be scrubbed and thoroughly rinsed with water. 

Lev 6:22 Any male who is a priest may eat the sacrifice. It is especially holy. 

Lev 6:23 But no one may eat any of the victims offered for sin, the blood of which has been taken into the Tent 



of Meeting to make expiation inside the sanctuary. These must be burnt’”. 

Lev 7:1 “‘This is the ritual for the sacrifice of reparation: ‘It is especially holy. 

Lev 7:2 The victim must be slaughtered where the burnt offerings are slaughtered, and the priest will pour the 
blood all around the altar. 

Lev 7:3 He will then offer all the fat: the tail, the fat covering the entrails, 

Lev 7:4 both kidneys, the fat on them and on the loins, the mass of fat which he will remove from the liver and 
kidneys. 

Lev 7:5 The priest will burn these pieces on the altar as food burnt for Yahweh. This is a sacrifice of reparation. 
Lev 7:6 Every male who is a priest may eat it. It will be eaten inside the holy place; it is especially holy. 

Lev 7:7 ‘As with the sacrifice for sin, so with the sacrifice of reparation — the ritual is the same for both. The 
offering with which the priest performs the rite of expiation will revert to the priest. 

Lev 7:8 The hide of the victim presented by someone to the priest to be offered as a burnt offering will revert to 
the priest. 

Lev 7:9 Every cereal offering baked in the oven, every cereal offering cooked in the pan or on the griddle will 
revert to the priest who offers it. 

Lev 7:10 Every cereal offering, mixed with oil or dry, will revert to all the descendants of Aaron without 
distinction. 

Lev 7:11 ‘This is the ritual for the communion sacrifice to be offered to Yahweh: 

Lev 7:12 ‘If this is offered as a sacrifice with praise, to the latter must be added an offering of unleavened cakes 
mixed with oil, unleavened wafers spread with oil, and wheaten flour in the form of cakes mixed with oil. 

Lev 7:13 This offering, then, must be added to the cakes of leavened bread and to the communion sacrifice with 
praise. 

Lev 7:14 One of the cakes of this offering must be presented as an offering to Yahweh; it will revert to the priest 
who pours out the blood of the communion sacrifice. 

Lev 7:15 The meat of the victim will be eaten on the day the offering is made; nothing may be left until next 
morning. 

Lev 7:16 ‘If the victim is offered as a votive or a voluntary sacrifice, it must be eaten on the day it is offered, and 
the remainder may be eaten on the following day; 

Lev 7:17 but on the third day whatever is left of the meat of the victim must be burnt. 

Lev 7:18 ‘If any of the meat of a victim offered as a communion sacrifice is eaten on the third day, the person 

who has offered it will not be acceptable and will receive no credit for it. It will count as rotten meat, and the 
person who eats it will bear the consequences of the guilt. 

Lev 7:19 ‘Meat that has touched anything unclean cannot be eaten; it must be burnt. ‘Anyone clean may eat the 
meat, 

Lev 7:20 but anyone unclean who eats the meat of a communion sacrifice offered to Yahweh will be outlawed 
from his people. 

Lev 7:21 Furthermore, if anyone touches anything unclean, human or animal, or any foul thing, and then eats 
the meat of a communion sacrifice offered to Yahweh, that individual will be outlawed from his people’”. 

Lev 7:22 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, 

Lev 7:23 “Speak to the Israelites and say: ‘You may not eat the fat of ox, sheep or goat. 

Lev 7:24 The fat of an animal that has died a natural death or been savaged by beasts may be used for any 

other purpose, but you are not to eat it. 

Lev 7:25 Anyone who eats the fat of an animal offered as food burnt for Yahweh will be outlawed from his 
people. 

Lev 7:26 ‘Wherever you live, you will never eat blood, whether it be of bird or of beast. 

Lev 7:27 Anyone who eats any blood will be outlawed from his people’”. 

Lev 7:28 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, 

Lev 7:29 “Speak to the Israelites and say: ‘Anyone who offers Yahweh a communion sacrifice must bring him 
part of his sacrifice as an offering. 

Lev 7:30 He must bring the food to be burnt for Yahweh, that is to say, the fat adhering to the forequarters, with 
his own hands. He will bring it, and also the forequarters, with which he will make the gesture of offering before 
Yahweh. 

Lev 7:31 The priest will then burn the fat on the altar, and the forequarters will revert to Aaron and his 
descendants. 

Lev 7:32 You will set aside the right thigh from your communion sacrifice and give it to the priest. 

Lev 7:33 The right thigh will be the portion of the descendant of Aaron who offers the blood and fat of the 
communion sacrifice. 

Lev 7:34 For I have deprived the Israelites of the forequarter offered and the thigh presented in their communion 
sacrifices, and given them to the priest Aaron and his descendants; this is a perpetual law for the Israelites’”. 



Lev 7:35 Such was the portion of Aaron and his descendants in the food burnt for Yahweh, the day he 
presented them to Yahweh for them to become his priests. 

Lev 7:36 This was what Yahweh ordered the Israelites to give them on the day they were anointed: a perpetual 
law for all their descendants. 

Lev 7:37 Such was the ritual for burnt offering, cereal offering, sacrifice for sin, sacrifice of reparation, investiture 
sacrifice and communion sacrifice, 

Lev 7:38 which Yahweh laid down for Moses on Mount Sinai, the day he ordered the Israelites to make their 
offerings to Yahweh in the desert of Sinai. 

Lev 8:1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: 

Lev 8:2 “Take Aaron and with him his sons, the vestments, the anointing oil, the bull for the sacrifice for sin, the 
two rams and the basket of unleavened bread. 

Lev 8:3 Then call the whole community together at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting”. 

Lev 8:4 Moses did as Yahweh ordered; the community gathered at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, 

Lev 8:5 and Moses said to them, “This is what Yahweh has ordered to be done”. 

Lev 8:6 He made Aaron and his sons come forward and washed them with water. 

Lev 8:7 He then dressed him in the tunic, passed the waistband round his waist, vested him in the robe and put 
the ephod on him. He then put the waistband of the ephod round his waist, fastening it to him. 

Lev 8:8 He put the breastplate on him, and placed the urim and thummim in it. 

Lev 8:9 He put the turban on his head, and on the front of the turban, the golden flower; this was the symbol of 

holy consecration, which Yahweh had prescribed to Moses. 

Lev 8:10 Moses then took the anointing oil and anointed the Dwelling and everything inside it, to consecrate 
them. 

Lev 8:11 He sprinkled the altar seven times and anointed the altar and its accessories, the basin and its stand, 
to consecrate them. 

Lev 8:12 He then poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him to consecrate him. 

Lev 8:13 Moses then made Aaron’s sons come forward; he dressed them in tunics, passed the waistbands 
round their waists and put on their head-dresses, as Yahweh had ordered him. 

Lev 8:14 He then had the bull for the sacrifice for sin brought forward. Aaron and his sons laid their hands on 
the victim’s head 

Lev 8:15 and Moses slaughtered it. He then took the blood and with his finger put some of it on the horns on the 
corners of the altar to purify the altar. He then poured the rest of the blood at the foot of the altar, which he 
consecrated by performing the rite of expiation over it. 

Lev 8:16 He then took all the fat covering the entrails, the mass of fat over the liver, both kidneys and their fat; 
and he burnt this on the altar, 

Lev 8:17 but the bull’s skin, its meat and its offal he burnt outside the camp, as Yahweh had ordered Moses. 

Lev 8:18 He then had the ram for the burnt offering brought forward. Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the 
ram’s head 

Lev 8:19 and Moses slaughtered it. He poured its blood all around the altar. 

Lev 8:20 He then quartered the ram and burned the head, the quarters and the fat. 

Lev 8:21 He then washed the entrails and shins, and burnt the whole ram on the altar, as a burnt offering, 
offered to be a pleasing smell, as food burnt for Yahweh, as Yahweh had ordered Moses. 

Lev 8:22 He then had the other ram brought forward, the ram for the investiture sacrifice. Aaron and his sons 
laid their hands on its head 

Lev 8:23 and Moses slaughtered it. He took some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron’s right ear, on the 
thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot. 

Lev 8:24 He then made Aaron’s sons come forward and he put some of the blood on the lobes of their right 
ears, on the thumbs of their right hands and on the big toes of their right feet. Next, Moses poured the rest of the 
blood all around the altar. 

Lev 8:25 He then took the fat: the tail, all the fat covering the entrails, the mass of fat over the liver, both kidneys 
and their fat, and the right thigh. 

Lev 8:26 From the basket of unleavened bread placed before Yahweh, he took an unleavened cake, a cake of 
bread made with oil, and a wafer; he placed these on the fat and the right thigh, 

Lev 8:27 and put it all into Aaron’s hands and those of his sons, and made the gesture of offering before 
Yahweh. 

Lev 8:28 Moses then took them away from them and burned them on the altar, with the burnt offering. This was 
the investiture sacrifice, offered to be a pleasing smell, as food burnt for Yahweh. 

Lev 8:29 Moses then took the forequarter and made the gesture of offering before Yahweh. This was the portion 
of the ram of investiture that reverted to Moses, as Yahweh had ordered Moses. 

Lev 8:30 Moses then took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood that was on the altar and sprinkled 



Aaron and his vestments, and his sons and their vestments, with it. In this way he consecrated Aaron and his 
vestments and his sons and their vestments. 

Lev 8:31 Moses then said to Aaron and his sons, “Cook the meat at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, and eat 
it there, as also the bread of the investiture sacrifice still in the basket of the investiture offerings, as I ordered, 
when I said, ‘Aaron and his sons must eat it’. 

Lev 8:32 What remains of the meat and bread you will burn. 

Lev 8:33 For seven days you will not leave the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, until the time of your investiture 
is complete; for your investiture will require seven days. 

Lev 8:34 Yahweh has ordered us to do as we have done today to perform the rite of expiation for you; 

Lev 8:35 hence, for seven days, day and night, you will remain at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting observing 
Yahweh’s ritual; do this, and you will not incur death. For this was the order I received”. 

Lev 8:36 So Aaron and his sons did everything that Yahweh had ordered through Moses. 

Lev 9:1 On the eighth day Moses summoned Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel; 

Lev 9:2 he said to Aaron, “Take a calf to offer a sacrifice for sin, and a ram for a burnt offering, both without 
blemish, and bring them before Yahweh. 

Lev 9:3 Then say to the Israelites, ‘Take a goat to be offered as a sacrifice for sin, a calf and a lamb one year 
old (both without blemish) for a burnt offering, 

Lev 9:4 a bull and a ram for communion sacrifices to be slaughtered before Yahweh, and a cereal offering 
mixed with oil. For Yahweh will appear to you today’”. 

Lev 9:5 They brought what Moses had ordered in front of the Tent of Meeting; then the whole community 
approached and stood before Yahweh. 

Lev 9:6 Moses then said, “This is what Yahweh has ordered you to do, so that his glory may be visible to you”. 
Lev 9:7 Moses then addressed Aaron, “Go to the altar and offer your sacrifice for sin and your burnt offering, 
and so perform the rite of expiation for yourself and your family. Then present the people’s offering and perform 
the rite of expiation for them, as Yahweh has ordered”. 

Lev 9:8 Aaron went to the altar and slaughtered the calf as a sacrifice for his own sin. 

Lev 9:9 Aaron’s sons then presented the blood to him; he dipped his finger in it and put some on the horns of 
the altar, and then poured the rest of the blood at the foot of the altar. 

Lev 9:10 The fat of the sacrifice for sin and the kidneys and the mass of fat over the liver he burned on the altar, 
as Yahweh had ordered Moses, 

Lev 9:11 and the meat and the skin he burned outside the camp. 

Lev 9:12 He then slaughtered the burnt offering; Aaron’s sons then handed him the blood, which he poured all 
around the altar. 

Lev 9:13 They then handed him the quartered victim and the head, and he burned these on the altar. 

Lev 9:14 He then washed the entrails and shins and burned them with the burnt offering on the altar. 

Lev 9:15 He then presented the people’s offering. He took the goat for the people’s sacrifice for sin, slaughtered 
it, and made a sacrifice for sin with it in the same way as with the first. 

Lev 9:16 He then had the burnt offering brought forward and proceeded according to the ritual. 

Lev 9:17 He then had the cereal offering brought forward, took a handful of it and burned it on the altar in 
addition to the morning burnt offering. 

Lev 9:18 Then he slaughtered the bull and the ram as a communion sacrifice for the people. Aaron’s sons 
handed him the blood and he poured it all around the altar. 

Lev 9:19 The fat of the bull and the ram, the tail, the covering fat, the kidneys, the mass of fat over the liver, 

Lev 9:20 he placed on the ribs and then burned on the altar. 

Lev 9:21 With the ribs and the right thigh Aaron made the gesture of offering as Yahweh had ordered Moses. 
Lev 9:22 Aaron then raised his hands towards the people and blessed them. Having thus performed the 
sacrifice for sin, the burnt offering and the communion sacrifice, he came down 

Lev 9:23 and entered the Tent of Meeting with Moses. Then they came out together to bless the people and the 
glory of Yahweh appeared to the entire people: 

Lev 9:24 a flame leapt out from Yahweh’s presence and consumed the burnt offering and fat on the altar. At this 
sight the entire people shouted for joy and fell on their faces. 

Lev 10:1 Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu each took his censer, put fire in it and incense on the fire, and 
presented unauthorised fire before Yahweh, which was not in accordance with his orders. 

Lev 10:2 At this a flame leapt out from Yahweh’s presence and swallowed them up, and they perished before 
Yahweh. 

Lev 10:3 Moses then said to Aaron, “That is what Yahweh meant when he said: In those who are close to me I 
show my holiness, and before all the people I show my glory”. Aaron remained silent. 

Lev 10:4 Moses summoned Mishael and Elzaphan, sons of Aaron’s uncle Uzziel, and said to them, “Come here 
and take your brothers away from the sanctuary, out of the camp”. 



Lev 10:5 They came and carried them away, still in their tunics, out of the camp, as Moses had said. 

Lev 1 0:6 Moses said to Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, “Do not disorder your hair or tear your clothes; 
or you may incur death and his retribution may overtake the whole community. No, it is for the entire House of 
Israel to lament your brothers who have been the victims of Yahweh’s fire. 

Lev 10:7 To avoid incurring death, do not leave the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, for Yahweh’s anointing oil 
is on you”. And they did as Moses said. 

Lev 10:8 Yahweh spoke to Aaron and said: 

Lev 10:9 “When you come to the Tent of Meeting, you and your sons with you, to avoid incurring death you may 
not drink wine or any other fermented liquor. This is a perpetual law for all your descendants. 

Lev 10:10 And so shall it be also when you separate the sacred from the profane, the unclean from the clean, 
Lev 10:1 1 and when you teach the Israelites any of the decrees that Yahweh has pronounced for them through 
Moses”. 

Lev 10:12 Moses said to Aaron and his surviving sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, “Take the cereal offering left over 
from the food burnt for Yahweh. Eat the unleavened part of it beside the altar, since it is especially holy. 

Lev 10:13 Eat it in the holy place, since it is the portion of the food burnt for Yahweh that is prescribed for you 
and your sons; this is the order I have received. 

Lev 10:14 “You, your sons and daughters with you, will eat in a clean place the forequarter offered and the thigh 
presented, for these have been given to you and your children as your due from the Israelites’ communion 
sacrifices. 

Lev 10:15 The thigh presented and the forequarter offered, once the fat has been burnt, revert to you and your 
sons with you, after they have been presented before Yahweh with the gesture of offering, in virtue of a 
perpetual law as Yahweh has ordered”. 

Lev 10:16 Moses then enquired carefully about the goat offered as a sacrifice for sin, and found that they had 
burnt it. He was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron’s surviving sons, and said, 

Lev 10:17 “Why did you not eat this victim for sin in the holy place, since it is especially holy and was given to 
you to take away the community’s guilt, by performing the rite of expiation for them before Yahweh? 

Lev 10:18 Since its blood was not taken inside the sanctuary, you should have eaten its meat there, as I 
ordered you”. 

Lev 10:19 Aaron said to Moses, “Look, today they offered their sacrifice for sin and their burnt offering before 
Yahweh, and these disasters have befallen me. If I had eaten the sin offering today, would this have met with 
Yahweh’s approval?”. 

Lev 10:20 And when Moses heard this, he was satisfied. 

Lev 11:1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron and said to them, 

Lev 1 1 :2 “Speak to the Israelites and say: ‘Of all animals living on land these are the creatures you may eat: 

Lev 11:3 ‘You may eat any animal that has a cloven hoof, divided into two parts, and that is a ruminant. 

Lev 1 1 :4 The following, which either chew the cud or have a cloven hoof, are the ones that you may not eat: you 
will regard the camel as unclean, because though it is ruminant, it does not have a cloven hoof; 

Lev 1 1:5 you will regard the coney as unclean, because though it is ruminant, it does not have a cloven hoof; 

Lev 1 1:6 you will regard the hare as unclean, because though it is ruminant, it does not have a cloven hoof; 

Lev 1 1:7 you will regard the pig as unclean, because though it has a cloven hoof, divided into two parts, it is not 
a ruminant. 

Lev 1 1 :8 You will not eat the meat of these or touch their dead bodies; you will regard them as unclean. 

Lev 1 1 :9 ‘Of all that lives in water, these you may eat: ‘Anything that has fins and scales, and lives in the water, 
whether in sea or river, you may eat. 

Lev 11:10 But anything in sea or river that does not have fins and scales, of all the small water-creatures and all 
the living things found there, you will regard as detestable. 

Lev 11:11 You will regard them as detestable; you must not eat their meat and you will regard their carcases as 
detestable. 

Lev 11:12 Anything that lives in water, but not having fins and scales, you will regard as detestable. 

Lev 11:13 ‘Of the birds these are the ones that you will regard as detestable; they may not be eaten, they are 
detestable for eating: ‘The tawny vulture, the griffon, the osprey, 

Lev 11:14 the kite, the various kinds of buzzard, 

Lev 11:15 all kinds of raven, 

Lev 11:16 the ostrich, the screech owl, the seagull, the various kinds of hawk, 

Lev 11:17 horned owl, night owl, cormorant, barn owl, 

Lev 11:18 ibis, pelican, white vulture, 

Lev 11:19 stork, the various kinds of heron, the hoopoe and the bat. 

Lev 1 1 :20 ‘All winged insects moving on four feet you will regard as detestable for eating. 

Lev 1 1 :21 Of all these winged insects you may eat only the following: those with the sort of legs above their feet 



which enable them to leap over the ground. 

Lev 1 1 :22 These are the ones you may eat: the various kinds of migratory locust, the various kinds of solham 
locust, hargol locust and hagab locust. 

Lev 1 1 :23 But all other winged insects on four feet you will regard as detestable for eating. 

Lev 1 1 :24 ‘By the following you will be made unclean. Anyone who touches the carcase of one will be unclean 
until evening. 

Lev 1 1:25 Anyone who picks up their carcases must wash his clothing and will be unclean until evening. 

Lev 1 1:26 Animals that have hoofs, but not cloven, and that are not ruminant, you will regard as unclean; 
anyone who touches them will be unclean. 

Lev 1 1 :27 Those four-footed animals which walk on the flat of their paws you will regard as unclean; anyone 
who touches their carcases will be unclean until evening, 

Lev 1 1 :28 and anyone who picks up their carcases must wash his clothing and will be unclean until evening. 

You will regard them as unclean. 

Lev 1 1 :29 ‘Of the small creatures which crawl along the ground, these are the ones which you will regard as 
unclean: the mole, the rat, the various kinds of lizard: 

Lev 11:30 gecko, koah, letaah, chameleon and tinshamet. 

Lev 1 1 :31 ‘Of all the small creatures, these are the animals which you must regard as disgusting. Anyone who 
touches them when they are dead will be unclean until evening. 

Lev 1 1:32 ‘Any object on which one of these creatures falls when it is dead becomes unclean: wooden utensil, 
clothing, skin, sacking, any utensil whatever. It must be immersed in water and will remain unclean until evening: 
then it will be clean. 

Lev 1 1 :33 If the creature falls into an earthenware vessel, the vessel must be broken; whatever the vessel 
contains is unclean. 

Lev 1 1 :34 Any edible food will be unclean if the water touches it; any drinkable liquid will be unclean, no matter 
what its container. 

Lev 1 1 :35 Anything on which the carcase of such a creature may fall will be unclean: be it oven or stove, it must 
be destroyed; for they are unclean and you will regard them as unclean 

Lev 1 1 :36 (although springs, wells and stretches of water will remain clean); anyone who touches one of their 
carcases will be unclean. 

Lev 1 1 :37 If one of their carcases falls on any kind of seed, the seed will remain clean; 

Lev 1 1 :38 but if the seed has been moistened and one of their carcases falls on it, you will regard it as unclean. 
Lev 1 1 :39 ‘If one of the animals that you use as food dies, anyone who touches the carcase will be unclean until 
evening; 

Lev 1 1 :40 anyone who eats any of the carcase must wash his clothing and will remain unclean until evening; 
anyone who picks up the carcase must wash his clothing and will remain unclean until evening. 

Lev 1 1 :41 ‘Any creature that swarms on the ground is detestable for eating; it must not be eaten. 

Lev 1 1 :42 Anything that moves on its belly, anything that moves on four legs or more — in short all the creatures 
that swarm on the ground — you will not eat, since they are detestable. 

Lev 1 1 :43 Do not make yourselves detestable with all these swarming creatures; do not defile yourselves with 
them, do not be defiled by them. 

Lev 1 1:44 For it is I, Yahweh, who am your God. You have been sanctified and have become holy because I am 
holy: do not defile yourselves with all these creatures that swarm on the ground. 

Lev 1 1 :45 Yes, it is I, Yahweh, who brought you out of Egypt to be your God: you must therefore be holy 
because I am holy’”. 

Lev 1 1:46 Such is the law concerning animals, birds, all living creatures that move in water and all creatures 
that swarm on the ground. 

Lev 1 1 :47 Its purpose is to distinguish the clean from the unclean, the creatures that may be eaten from those 
that may not be eaten. 

Lev 12:1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, 

Lev 1 2:2 “Speak to the Israelites and say: ‘If a woman becomes pregnant and gives birth to a boy, she will be 
unclean for seven days as when in a state of pollution due to menstruation. 

Lev 12:3 On the eighth day the child’s foreskin must be circumcised, 

Lev 1 2:4 and she will wait another thirty-three days for her blood to be purified. She will not touch anything 
consecrated nor go to the sanctuary until the time of her purification is over. 

Lev 12:5 ‘If she gives birth to a girl, she will be unclean for two weeks, as during her monthly periods; and will 
wait another sixty-six days for her blood to be purified. 

Lev 1 2:6 ‘When the period of her purification is over, for either boy or girl, she will bring the priest at the 
entrance to the Tent of Meeting a lamb one year old for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon or turtledove as a 
sacrifice for sin. 



Lev 12:7 The priest must offer this before Yahweh, perform the rite of expiation for her, and she will be purified 
from her discharge of blood. ‘Such is the law concerning a woman who gives birth to either a boy or a girl. 

Lev 1 2:8 If she cannot afford a lamb, she must take two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for the burnt 
offering and the other for the sacrifice for sin. The priest will perform the rite of expiation for her and she will be 
purified’”. 

Lev 13:1 Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, 

Lev 13:2 “If a swelling or scab or spot appears on someone’s skin, which could develop into a contagious skin- 
disease, that person must then be taken to the priest, either Aaron or one of his sons. 

Lev 1 3:3 The priest will examine the disease on the skin. If the hair on the diseased part has turned white, or if 
the disease bites into the skin, the skin-disease is contagious, and after examination the priest will declare the 
person unclean. 

Lev 1 3:4 But if there is a white spot on the skin without any visible depression of the skin or whitening of the 
hair, the priest will isolate the sick person for seven days. 

Lev 1 3:5 On the seventh day he will examine the person, and if he observes that the disease persists though 
without spreading over the skin, he will isolate the person for a further seven days 

Lev 13:6 and examine him again on the seventh. If he finds that the disease has faded and has not spread over 
the skin, the priest will declare the person clean. This was merely a scab. Once he has washed his clothing he 
will be clean. 

Lev 13:7 “But if the scab spreads over the skin after the sick person has been examined by the priest and 
declared clean, then he will let himself be examined again by the priest. 

Lev 1 3:8 After examining him and certifying the spread of the scab over the skin, the priest will declare him 
unclean: it is a contagious skin-disease. 

Lev 13:9 “Someone who has a contagious skin-disease must be taken to the priest. 

Lev 13:10 The priest will examine the sick person, and if he finds a whitish swelling with whitening of the hair 
and an ulcer forming on the skin, 

Lev 13:1 1 this is a dormant skin-disease, and the priest will declare the person unclean. He will not isolate him; 
he is obviously unclean. 

Lev 13:12 “But if the disease spreads all through the skin, if it covers the person entirely from head to foot so far 
as the priest can see, 

Lev 13:13 the priest will then examine the sick person and, if he finds that the skin-disease covers his whole 
body, declare the sick person clean. Since it has all become white, he is clean. 

Lev 13:14 But as soon as an ulcer appears on him, he will be unclean. 

Lev 13:15 After examining the ulcer, the priest will declare him unclean: the ulcer is unclean, it is contagious. 
Lev 13:16 But if the ulcer becomes white again, the sick person will go to the priest; 

Lev 13:17 the priest will examine him and if he finds that the disease has turned white, he will declare the sick 
person clean: he is clean. 

Lev 13:18 “When an ulcer appears on someone’s skin, and then gets better, 

Lev 13:19 and if then a white swelling ora reddish-white spot forms on the same place, the sick person will 
show himself to the priest. 

Lev 1 3:20 The priest will examine him, and if he finds a visible depression in the skin and a whitening of the 
hair, he will declare the person unclean: this is a case of contagious skin-disease breaking out in an ulcer. 

Lev 1 3:21 But if on examination the priest finds neither white hair nor depression of the skin, but a fading of the 
affected part, he will isolate the sick person for seven days. 

Lev 13:22 If the disease has then spread over the skin, he will declare the person unclean: this is a case of 
contagious skin-disease. 

Lev 13:23 But if the spot has stayed where it was and has not spread, it is the scar of the ulcer and the priest 
will declare the person clean. 

Lev 13:24 “If someone has a burn on the skin and an abscess, a reddish-white or white spot, forms on the burn, 
Lev 1 3:25 the priest will then examine it. If he finds a whitening of the hair or a visible depression of the mark on 
the skin, a contagious disease has broken out in the burn. The priest will declare the sick person unclean: this is 
a contagious skin-disease. 

Lev 1 3:26 If on the other hand the priest on examination does not find white hair on the mark or depression of 
the skin, but a fading of the mark, the priest will isolate the person for seven days. 

Lev 13:27 He will examine the person on the seventh day and, if the disease has spread over the skin, he will 
declare the sick person unclean: this is a case of contagious skin-disease. 

Lev 1 3:28 If the mark has stayed where it was and has not spread over the skin, but has faded instead, it was 
only a swelling due to the burn. The priest will declare the person clean: it is merely a burn scar. 

Lev 1 3:29 “If a man or a woman has a sore on the head or chin, 

Lev 13:30 the priest will examine the sore; and if he finds a depression visible in the skin, with the hair on it 



yellow and thin, he will declare the sick person unclean: this is tinea, that is to say, a contagious skin-disease of 
the head or chin. 

Lev 1 3:31 If on examining this case of tinea the priest finds no visible depression in the skin and no yellow hair, 
he will isolate the person so affected for seven days. 

Lev 13:32 He will examine the infected part on the seventh day, and if he finds that the tinea has not spread, 

that the hair on it is not yellow, and that there is no visible depression in the skin, 

Lev 1 3:33 the sick person will shave his hair off, all except the part affected with tinea, and the priest will again 
isolate him for seven days. 

Lev 13:34 He will examine the infected part on the seventh day, and if he finds that it has not spread over the 
skin, and that there is no visible depression of the skin, the priest will declare the sick person clean. After 
washing his clothes the person will be clean. 

Lev 1 3:35 But if after this purification the tinea does spread over the skin, 

Lev 1 3:36 the priest will examine the person; if he finds that the tinea has indeed spread over the skin, the sick 
person is unclean, and there is no need to verify whether the hair is yellow. 

Lev 13:37 Whereas if, so far as he can see, the tinea is arrested and dark hair is beginning to grow on it, the 

sick person is cured. He is clean, and the priest will declare him clean. 

Lev 1 3:38 “If spots break out on the skin of a man or woman, and if these spots are white, 

Lev 1 3:39 the priest will examine them. If he finds that the spots are of a dull white, this is a rash that has 
broken out on the skin: the sick person is clean. 

Lev 1 3:40 “If someone loses the hair of the scalp, this is baldness of the scalp but the person is clean. 

Lev 1 3:41 If he loses hair off the front of the head, this is baldness of the forehead but the person is clean. 

Lev 13:42 If, however, a reddish-white sore appears on scalp or forehead, a contagious skin-disease has 
broken out on the scalp or forehead. 

Lev 1 3:43 The priest will examine it, and if he finds a reddish-white swelling on scalp or forehead, looking like a 
contagious skin-disease, 

Lev 13:44 the person has such a disease: he is unclean. The priest will declare him unclean; he has a 
contagious skin-disease of the head. 

Lev 1 3:45 “Anyone with a contagious skin-disease will wear torn clothing and disordered hair; and will cover the 
upper lip and shout, ‘Unclean, unclean’. 

Lev 13:46 As long as the disease lasts, such a person will be unclean and, being unclean, will live alone and 
live outside the camp. 

Lev 1 3:47 “When a piece of clothing is infected with mould, be it woollen or linen clothing, 

Lev 1 3:48 linen or woollen fabric or covering, or leather or anything made of leather, 

Lev 1 3:49 if the spot on the clothing, leather, fabric, covering or object made of leather is a greenish or reddish 
colour, it is a disease to be shown to the priest. 

Lev 1 3:50 The priest will examine the infection and isolate the object for seven days. 

Lev 13:51 If on the seventh day he observes that the infection has spread on the clothing, fabric, covering, 
leather or object made of leather, whatever it may be, this is a contagious disease and the object is unclean. 

Lev 13:52 He will burn this clothing, fabric, linen or woollen covering or leather object whatever it may be, on 
which the infection has appeared; for this is a contagious disease which must be destroyed by fire. 

Lev 1 3:53 “But if on examination the priest finds that the infection has not spread on the clothing, fabric, 
covering, or leather object whatever it may be, 

Lev 13:54 he will order the infected object to be washed and will isolate it again for a period of seven days. 

Lev 1 3:55 After the washing, he will examine the infection and if he finds that there is no change in its 
appearance, even though it has not spread, the article is unclean. You will burn it; it is infected through and 
through. 

Lev 1 3:56 “But if on examination the priest finds that the infection has diminished after washing, he will tear it out 
of the clothing, leather, fabric or covering. 

Lev 13:57 But if the infection reappears on the same clothing, fabric, covering or leather object whatever it may 
be, this means that the infection is active; you will burn whatever is infected. 

Lev 13:58 The clothing, fabric, covering or leather object whatever it may be, from which the infection 
disappears after being washed, will be clean after it has been washed a second time. 

Lev 1 3:59 “Such is the law governing disease in a linen or woollen garment, a fabric or covering or leather object 
whatever it may be, when it is a question of declaring them clean or unclean”. 

Lev 14:1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: 

Lev 14:2 “This is the law to be applied on the day of the purification of someone who has suffered from a 
contagious skin-disease. Such a person will be taken to the priest, 

Lev 14:3 and the priest will go outside the camp. If he finds on examination that the person has recovered from 
the disease, 



Lev 14:4 he will order the following to be brought for his purification: two live birds that are clean, some cedar 
wood, scarlet material and hyssop. 

Lev 14:5 He will then order one of the birds to be slaughtered in an earthenware pot over running water. 

Lev 14:6 He will then take the live bird, the cedar wood, the scarlet material and the hyssop and dip all this 
(including the live bird) into the blood of the bird slaughtered over running water. 

Lev 14:7 He will then sprinkle the person to be purified of the skin-disease seven times, and having declared the 
person clean, will set the live bird free to fly off into the countryside. 

Lev 14:8 The person who is being purified will then wash all clothing, shave off all hair, and wash, and will then 
be clean. After this he will return to the camp, although he will remain outside his tent for seven days. 

Lev 14:9 On the seventh day he will shave off all his hair-head, beard and eyebrows; he will shave off all his 
hair. After washing his clothing and his body he will be clean. 

Lev 14:10 “On the eighth day he will take two unblemished lambs, an unblemished ewe one year old, three- 
tenths of wheaten flour mixed with oil for the cereal offering, and one log of oil. 

Lev 14:1 1 The priest who is performing the purification will place the person who is being purified, with all his 
offerings, at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, before Yahweh. 

Lev 14:12 He will then take one of the lambs and offer it as a sacrifice of reparation, as also the log of oil. With 
these he will make the gesture of offering before Yahweh. 

Lev 14:13 He will then slaughter the lamb on that spot inside the holy place where the victims for the sacrifice 
for sin and for the burnt offering are slaughtered. This reparatory offering, like the sacrifice for sin, will revert to 
the priest: it is especially holy. 

Lev 14:14 The priest will then take some blood of this sacrifice and put it on the lobe of the right ear, the thumb 
of the right hand, and the big toe of the right foot of the person who is being purified. 

Lev 14:15 He will then take the log of oil and pour a little into the hollow of his left hand. 

Lev 14:16 He will dip a finger of his right hand into the oil in the hollow of his left hand, and sprinkle the oil with 
his finger seven times before Yahweh. 

Lev 14:17 He will then take some of the oil left in the hollow of his hand and put it on the lobe of the right ear, 
the thumb of the right hand, and the big toe of the right foot of the person being purified, in addition to the blood 
of the sacrifice of reparation. 

Lev 14:18 The rest of the oil in the hollow of his hand he will put on the head of the person who is being purified. 
This is how the priest will perform the rite of expiation for such a person before Yahweh. 

Lev 14:19 The priest will then offer the sacrifice for sin, and perform the rite of expiation for uncleanness for the 
person who is being purified. After this, he will slaughter the burnt offering 

Lev 14:20 and offer this and the cereal offering on the altar. So, when the priest has performed the rite of 
expiation for him the person will be clean. 

Lev 14:21 “If he is poor and cannot afford all this, he need take only one lamb, the one for the sacrifice of 
reparation, and this will be presented with the gesture of offering to perform the rite of expiation for him. And for 
the cereal offering he will only take one-tenth of wheaten flour mixed with oil, and the log of oil, 

Lev 14:22 and two turtledoves or two young pigeons, whichever he can afford, one for a sacrifice for sin and the 
other for the burnt offering. 

Lev 14:23 He will bring these on the eighth day to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting before 
Yahweh, for his purification. 

Lev 14:24 The priest will take the lamb for the sacrifice of reparation and the log of oil, and present them before 
Yahweh with the gesture of offering. 

Lev 14:25 He will then slaughter the lamb for the sacrifice of reparation, take some of its blood and put it on the 
lobe of the right ear, the thumb of the right hand and the big toe of the right foot of the person who is being 
purified. 

Lev 14:26 He will pour the oil into the hollow of his left hand, 

Lev 14:27 and with his finger sprinkle the oil in the hollow of his left hand seven times before Yahweh. 

Lev 14:28 He will then put some of the oil on the lobe of the right ear, the thumb of the right hand and the big 
toe of the right foot of the person who is being purified, as he did with the blood of the sacrifice of reparation. 

Lev 14:29 The remainder of the oil in the hollow of his hand he will put on the head of the person who is being 
purified, thus performing the rite of expiation for him before Yahweh. 

Lev 14:30 Of the two turtledoves or two young pigeons — whatever he has been able to afford — he will offer 
Lev 14:31 a sacrifice for sin with one, and with the other a burnt offering with a cereal offering — whatever he 
has been able to afford. This is how the priest will perform before Yahweh the rite of expiation for the person who 
is being purified. 

Lev 14:32 “Such is the law concerning someone with a contagious skin-disease who cannot afford the means of 
purification”. 

Lev 14:33 Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron and said: 



Lev 14:34 “When you reach Canaan, which I am giving you as your possession, if I infect a house with a 
disease in the country which you are to possess, 

Lev 14:35 the owner will come and inform the priest and say, ‘I have seen something like a skin-disease in the 
house’. 

Lev 14:36 The priest will order the house to be emptied before he goes to examine the infection, or everything in 
the house will become unclean; after which, the priest will go inside and examine the house; 

Lev 14:37 and if on examination he finds the walls of the house pitted with reddish or greenish depressions 
which appear to be eating away the wall, 

Lev 14:38 the priest will then go out of the house, to the door, and shut it up for seven days. 

Lev 14:39 On the seventh day, the priest will come back and if on examination he finds that the infection has 
spread over the walls of the house, 

Lev 14:40 he will order the infected stones to be removed and thrown into some unclean place outside the town. 
Lev 14:41 He will then have all the inside of the house scraped, and the plaster that comes off will be emptied in 
an unclean place outside the town. 

Lev 14:42 The stones will then be replaced with new ones and the house given a new coat of plaster. 

Lev 14:43 “If the infection spreads again after the stones have been removed and the house scraped and 
replastered, 

Lev 14:44 the priest will come and examine it. If he finds that the infection has spread, this means that there is a 
contagious disease in the house: it is unclean. 

Lev 14:45 It must be pulled down and the stones, woodwork and all the plaster be taken to an unclean place 
outside the town. 

Lev 14:46 “Anyone who enters the house while it is closed will be unclean until evening. 

Lev 14:47 Anyone who sleeps there will wash his clothes. Anyone who eats there will wash his clothes. 

Lev 14:48 But if the priest finds, when he comes to examine the infection, that it has not spread in the house 
since it was plastered, he will declare the house clean, for the infection is cured. 

Lev 14:49 “As a sacrifice for the defilement of the house, he will take two birds, some cedar wood, scarlet 
material and hyssop. 

Lev 14:50 He will slaughter one of the birds in an earthenware pot over running water. 

Lev 14:51 He will then take the cedar wood, the hyssop, the scarlet material and the live bird, dip them into the 

blood of the slaughtered bird and into the running water and sprinkle the house seven times; 

Lev 14:52 and after offering the sacrifice for the defilement of the house with the blood of the bird, the running 
water, the live bird, the cedar wood, the hyssop and the scarlet material, 

Lev 14:53 he will set the live bird free to fly out of the town into the countryside. Once the rite of expiation has 
been performed for the house in this way it will be clean. 

Lev 14:54 “Such is the law governing all kinds of skin-disease and tinea, 

Lev 14:55 diseases of clothing and houses, 

Lev 14:56 swellings, scabs and spots. It defines the occasions when things are unclean and when clean. 

Lev 14:57 Such is the law on skin-diseases”. 

Lev 15:1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron and said: 

Lev 1 5:2 “Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘When a man has a discharge from his body, that discharge 
is unclean. 

Lev 15:3 While the discharge continues, the nature of his uncleanness is as follows: ‘Whether his body allows 
the discharge to flow or whether it retains it, he is unclean. 

Lev 15:4 ‘Any bed the man lies on and anything he sits on will be unclean. 

Lev 15:5 ‘Anyone who touches his bed must wash clothing and body and will be unclean until evening. 

Lev 15:6 ‘Anyone who sits where the man has sat must wash clothing and body and will be unclean until 
evening. 

Lev 1 5:7 ‘Anyone who touches the body of the man with the discharge must wash clothing and body and will be 
unclean until evening. 

Lev 1 5:8 ‘If the man with the discharge spits on someone who is clean, that person must wash clothing and 
body and will be unclean until evening. 

Lev 15:9 ‘Any saddle the man has ridden on will be unclean. 

Lev 15:10 ‘All those who touch any object that has been under him will be unclean until evening. ‘Anyone who 
picks up such an object must wash clothing and body and will be unclean until evening. 

Lev 15:1 1 ‘All those whom the man with the discharge touches without having washed his hands must wash 
clothing and body and will be unclean until evening. 

Lev 15:12 ‘The earthenware vessel he touches must be broken and any wooden utensil must be rinsed. 

Lev 15:13 ‘Once the man with the discharge is cured, he will allow seven days for his purification. He will wash 
his clothes and wash his body in running water and he will be clean. 



Lev 15:14 On the eighth day he will take two turtledoves or two young pigeons and come before Yahweh at the 
entrance to the Tent of Meeting and give them to the priest. 

Lev 15:15 The priest will offer one of them as a sacrifice for sin and the other as a burnt offering. And in this way 
the priest will perform the rite of expiation for him before Yahweh for his discharge. 

Lev 15:16 ‘When a man has a seminal discharge, he must wash his whole body with water and will be unclean 
until evening. 

Lev 15:17 Any clothing or leather touched by the seminal discharge must be washed and will be unclean until 
evening. 

Lev 15:18 When a woman has had intercourse with a man, both of them must wash and will be unclean until 
evening. 

Lev 15:19 ‘Whenever a woman has a discharge and the discharge from her body is of blood, she will remain in 
a state of menstrual pollution for seven days. ‘Anyone who touches her will be unclean until evening. 

Lev 15:20 ‘Anything she lies on in this polluted state will be unclean; anything she sits on will be unclean. 

Lev 15:21 ‘Anyone who touches her bed must wash clothing and body and will be unclean until evening. 

Lev 15:22 ‘Anyone who touches anything she has sat on must wash clothing and body and will be unclean until 
evening. 

Lev 15:23 If there is anything on the bed or where she is sitting, anyone who touches it will be unclean until 
evening. 

Lev 1 5:24 ‘If a man goes so far as to sleep with her, he will contract her menstrual pollution and will be unclean 
for seven days. Any bed he lies on will be unclean. 

Lev 15:25 ‘If a woman has a prolonged discharge of blood outside the period, or if the period is prolonged, 
during the time this discharge lasts she will be in the same state of uncleanness as during her monthly periods. 
Lev 15:26 Any bed she lies on during the time this discharge lasts will be polluted in the same way as the bed 
she lies on during her monthly periods. Anything she sits on will be unclean as during her monthly periods. 

Lev 15:27 Anyone who touches it will be unclean and must wash clothing and body and will be unclean until 
evening. 

Lev 1 5:28 ‘Once she is cured of her discharge, she will allow seven days to go by; after that she will be clean. 
Lev 1 5:29 On the eighth day she will take two turtledoves or two young pigeons and bring them to the priest at 
the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 

Lev 15:30 The priest will offer one of them as a sacrifice for sin and the other as a burnt offering. And in this way 
the priest will perform the rite of expiation for her before Yahweh for the discharge which made her unclean. 

Lev 1 5:31 ‘Hence you will warn the Israelites against contracting a state of uncleanness, rather than incurring 
death by defiling my Dwelling which is among them. 

Lev 15:32 ‘Such is the law governing a man with a discharge or who is made unclean by a seminal discharge, 
Lev 15:33 a woman in a state of pollution due to menstruation, a man or a woman with a discharge, or a man 
who sleeps with a woman when she is unclean’”. 

Lev 16:1 Yahweh spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron who died when offering unauthorised 
fire. 

Lev 16:2 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: “Tell Aaron your brother that he may not enter the sanctuary inside 
the curtain in front of the mercy-seat on the ark whenever he chooses, in case he incurs death, for I appear in a 
cloud on the mercy-seat. 

Lev 16:3 “This is how he must enter the sanctuary: with a young bull for a sacrifice for sin and a ram for a burnt 
offering. 

Lev 1 6:4 He will put on a tunic of consecrated linen, wear linen drawers on his body, a linen waistband round his 
waist, and a linen turban on his head. These are the sacred vestments he will put on after washing himself. 

Lev 16:5 “From the community of Israelites he will receive two he-goats for a sacrifice for sin and a ram for a 
burnt offering. 

Lev 16:6 After offering the bull as a sacrifice for his own sin and performing the rite of expiation for himself and 
his family, 

Lev 16:7 he will take the two he-goats and place them before Yahweh at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 

Lev 16:8 Aaron will then draw lots over the two goats, one lot to be for Yahweh and the other lot for Azazel. 

Lev 1 6:9 Aaron will then take the goat on which the lot ‘For Yahweh’ has fallen, and offer it as a sacrifice for sin. 
Lev 16:10 But the goat on which the lot ‘For Azazel’ has fallen, will be placed alive before Yahweh, for the rite 
of expiation to be performed with it, and for it then to be sent to Azazel in the desert. 

Lev 16:1 1 “Having offered the bull as a sacrifice for his own sin and performed the rite of expiation for himself 
and for his family, and slaughtered the bull as a sacrifice for sin, 

Lev 16:12 Aaron will then fill a censer with live coals from the altar before Yahweh, take two handfuls of finely 
ground aromatic incense and bring this inside the curtain. 

Lev 16:13 He will then put the incense on the fire before Yahweh, so that the cloud of incense hides the mercy- 



seat which is on the Testimony and he does not incur death. 

Lev 16:14 He will then take some of the bull’s blood and sprinkle it with his finger on the eastern side of the 
mercy-seat. He will sprinkle some of the blood seven times with his finger in front of the mercy-seat. 

Lev 16:15 “He will then slaughter the goat for the sacrifice for the sin of the people, and take its blood inside the 
curtain, and with this blood do as he did with the blood of the bull, sprinkling it on the mercy-seat and in front of 
it. 

Lev 16:16 This is how he must perform the rite of expiation for the sanctuary for the uncleanness of the 
Israelites, for their acts of rebellion and all their sins. “And this is what he must do for the Tent of Meeting which 
remains with them, surrounded by their uncleanness. 

Lev 16:17 No one must be inside the Tent of Meeting, from the moment he enters to make expiation in the 
sanctuary until the time he comes out. “When he has made expiation for himself, for his family, and for the whole 
community of Israel, 

Lev 16:18 he must come outside, go to the altar before Yahweh and perform the rite of expiation for it. He will 
take some of the bull’s blood and some of the goat’s blood and put it on the horns at the corners of the altar all 
around it, 

Lev 16:19 and sprinkle some of the blood on it seven times with his finger, thus purifying it and setting it apart 
from the uncleanness of the Israelites. 

Lev 16:20 “Once expiation for the sanctuary, the Tent of Meeting and the altar is complete, he will bring the goat 
which is still alive. 

Lev 16:21 Aaron will then lay both his hands on its head and over it confess all the guilt of the Israelites, all their 
acts of rebellion and all their sins. Having thus laid them on the goat’s head, he will send it out into the desert 
under the charge of a man waiting ready, 

Lev 1 6:22 and the goat will bear all their guilt away into some desolate place. “When he has sent the goat into 
the desert, 

Lev 16:23 Aaron will go back into the Tent of Meeting and take off the linen vestments which he wore to enter 
the sanctuary and leave them there. 

Lev 16:24 He will then wash his body inside the holy place, put on his vestments and come outside to offer his 
own and the people’s burnt offering. He will perform the rite of expiation for himself and for the people, 

Lev 1 6:25 and burn the fat of the sacrifice for sin on the altar. 

Lev 16:26 The man who led the goat away to Azazel will wash his clothes and body before entering the camp. 
Lev 16:27 The bull and the goat offered as a sacrifice for sin, the blood of which was taken into the sanctuary for 
the rite of expiation, must be taken outside the camp, where their skin, meat and offal are to be burnt. 

Lev 16:28 The man who burns them will wash his clothes and body before entering the camp. 

Lev 1 6:29 This will be a perpetual law for you. “On the tenth day of the seventh month you will fast and refrain 
from work, both citizen and resident alien; 

Lev 16:30 for this is the day on which the rite of expiation will be performed for you to purify you, to purify you 
before Yahweh from all your sins. 

Lev 1 6:31 It will be a sabbatical rest for you and you will fast. This is a perpetual law. 

Lev 16:32 The rite of expiation will be performed by the priest who has been anointed and installed to officiate 
in succession to his father. He will put on the linen vestments, the sacred vestments, 

Lev 16:33 and perform the rite of expiation for the holy sanctuary, the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and will 
then perform the rite of expiation for the priests and all the people of the community. 

Lev 1 6:34 This will be a perpetual law for you; once a year the rite of expiation will be made for the Israelites for 
all their sins”. And as Yahweh ordered Moses, so it was done. 

Lev 17:1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: 

Lev 17:2 “Speak to Aaron and his sons and all the Israelites and say: ‘This is the order that Yahweh has given: 
Lev 17:3 ‘Any man of the House of Israel who slaughters a bull, lamb or goat, whether inside the camp or 
outside it, 

Lev 17:4 without bringing it to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting to make an offering of it to Yahweh in front of 
his Dwelling, that man will be answerable for bloodshed; he has shed blood, and that man will be outlawed from 
his people. 

Lev 17:5 The purpose of this is that the Israelites should instead bring their sacrifices, which they would 
otherwise offer in the countryside, to Yahweh at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, to the priest, and offer them 
as communion sacrifices to Yahweh; 

Lev 17:6 and the priest will sprinkle the blood on Yahweh’s altar at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and will 
burn the fat as a smell pleasing to Yahweh. 

Lev 17:7 No longer may they offer their sacrifices to the satyrs in whose service they used to prostitute 
themselves. This is a perpetual law for them and for their descendants’. 

Lev 17:8 “You will also say to them, ‘Any member of the House of Israel or any resident alien who offers a burnt 



offering or sacrifice 

Lev 17:9 without bringing it to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting to offer it to Yahweh, will be outlawed from his 
people. 

Lev 17:10 ‘If any member of the House of Israel or any resident alien consumes blood of any kind, I shall set my 
face against that individual who consumes blood and shall outlaw him from his people. 

Lev 17:1 1 For the life of the creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you for performing the rite of expiation 
on the altar for your lives, for blood is what expiates for a life. 

Lev 17:12 That is why I told the Israelites: None of you will consume blood, nor will any resident alien consume 
blood. 

Lev 17:13 ‘Anyone, whether Israelite or resident alien, who hunts and catches game, whether animal or bird, 
which it is lawful to eat, must pour out its blood and cover it with earth. 

Lev 17:14 For the life of every creature is its blood, and I have told the Israelites: You will not consume the 
blood of any creature, for the life of every creature is its blood, and anyone who consumes it will be outlawed. 

Lev 17:15 ‘Anyone, citizen or alien, who eats an animal that has died a natural death or been savaged, must 
wash clothing and body, and will be unclean until evening, but will then be clean. 

Lev 17:16 But anyone who does not wash clothing and body will bear the consequences of his guilt’”. 

Lev 18:1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: 

Lev 18:2 “Speak to the Israelites and say: ‘I am Yahweh your God: 

Lev 18:3 You must not behave as they do in Egypt where you used to live; you must not behave as they do in 
Canaan where I am taking you, nor must you follow their laws. 

Lev 18:4 You must observe my customs and keep my laws, following them. ‘I, Yahweh, am your God: 

Lev 18:5 hence you will keep my laws and my customs. Whoëver complies with them will find life in them. ‘I am 
Yahweh. 

Lev 18:6 ‘None of you will approach a woman who is closely related to him, to have intercourse with her. I am 
Yahweh. 

Lev 18:7 ‘You will not have intercourse with your father or your mother. She is your mother — you will not have 
intercourse with her. 

Lev 18:8 ‘You will not have intercourse with your father’s wife; it is your father’s sexual prerogative. 

Lev 18:9 ‘You will not have intercourse with your sister, whether she is your father’s or your mother’s daughter. 
Whether she was born in the same house or elsewhere, you will not have intercourse with her. 

Lev 18:10 ‘You will not have intercourse with your son’s or your daughter’s daughter; for their sexual privacy is 
your own. 

Lev 18:1 1 ‘You will not have intercourse with the daughter of your father’s wife, born to your father. She is your 
sister; you will not have intercourse with her. 

Lev 18:12 ‘You will not have intercourse with your father’s sister; for she is your father’s own flesh and blood. 

Lev 18:13 ‘You will not have intercourse with your mother’s sister; for she is your mother’s own flesh and blood. 
Lev 18:14 ‘You will not have intercourse with your father’s brother; you will not approach his wife. She is your 
aunt. 

Lev 18:15 ‘You will not have intercourse with your daughter-in-law. She is your son’s wife; you will not have 
intercourse with her. 

Lev 18:16 ‘You will not have intercourse with your brother’s wife; it is your brother’s sexual prerogative. 

Lev 18:17 ‘You will not have intercourse with a woman and her daughter; nor will you take her son’s or her 
daughter’s daughter, to have intercourse with them. They are your own flesh and blood; it would be incest. 

Lev 18:18 ‘You will not take a woman and her sister into your harem at the same time, to have intercourse with 
the latter while the former is still alive. 

Lev 18:19 ‘You will not approach and have intercourse with a woman who is in a state of menstrual pollution. 
Lev 18:20 ‘Furthermore, you will not have intercourse with your fellow-citizen’s wife; you would become unclean 
by doing so. 

Lev 18:21 ‘You will not allow any of your children to be sacrificed to Molech, thus profaning the name of your 
God. I am Yahweh. 

Lev 18:22 ‘You will not have intercourse with a man as you would with a woman. This is a hateful thing. 

Lev 18:23 ‘You will not have intercourse with any kind of animal; you would become unclean by doing so. Nor 
will a woman offer herself to an animal, to have intercourse with it. This would be a violation of nature. 

Lev 18:24 ‘Do not make yourselves unclean by any of these practices, for it was by such things that the nations 
that I am driving out before you made themselves unclean. 

Lev 18:25 The country has become unclean; hence I am about to punish it for its guilt, and the country itself will 
vomit out its inhabitants. 

Lev 18:26 ‘You, however, must keep my laws and customs and not do any of these hateful things: none of your 
citizens, none of your resident aliens. 



Lev 18:27 For all these hateful things were done by the people who lived in the country before you, and the 
country became unclean. 

Lev 18:28 If you make it unclean, will it not vomit you out as it vomited out the nations there before you? 

Lev 18:29 Yes, anyone who does any of these hateful things, whatever it may be, any person doing so, will be 
outlawed from his people; 

Lev 18:30 so keep my rules and do not observe any of the hateful laws which were in force before you came; 
then you will not be made unclean by them. I am Yahweh your God’”. 

Lev 19:1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: 

Lev 1 9:2 “Speak to the whole community of Israelites and say: ‘Be holy, for I, Yahweh your God, am holy. 

Lev 19:3 ‘Each of you will respect father and mother. ‘And you will keep my Sabbaths; I am Yahweh your God. 
Lev 1 9:4 ‘Do not turn to idols and do not cast metal gods for yourselves. I am Yahweh your God. 

Lev 1 9:5 ‘If you offer a communion sacrifice to Yahweh, make it in such a way as to be acceptable. 

Lev 19:6 It must be eaten the same day or the day after; whatever is left on the third day must be burnt. 

Lev 19:7 If eaten on the third day it would be rotten food and not be acceptable. 

Lev 19:8 Anyone who eats it must bear the consequences of this guilt, having profaned Yahweh’s holiness; that 
person will be outlawed from his people. 

Lev 1 9:9 ‘When you reap the harvest of your land, you will not reap to the very edges of the field, nor will you 
gather the gleanings of the harvest; 

Lev 19:10 nor will you strip your vineyard bare, nor pick up the fallen grapes. You will leave them for the poor 
and the stranger. I am Yahweh your God. 

Lev 19:1 1 ‘You will not steal, nor deal deceitfully or fraudulently with your fellow-citizen. 

Lev 19:12 You will not swear by my name with intent to deceive and thus profane the name of your God. I am 
Yahweh. 

Lev 19:13 You will not exploit or rob your fellow. You will not keep back the labourer’s wage until next morning. 
Lev 19:14 You will not curse the dumb or put an obstacle in the way of the blind, but will fear your God. I am 
Yahweh. 

Lev 19:15 ‘You will not be unjust in administering justice. You will neither be partial to the poor nor overawed by 
the great, but will administer justice to your fellow-citizen justly. 

Lev 19:16 You will not go about slandering your own family, nor will you put your neighbour’s life in jeopardy. I 
am Yahweh. 

Lev 19:17 You will not harbour hatred for your brother. You will reprove your fellow-countryman firmly and thus 
avoid burdening yourself with a sin. 

Lev 19:18 You will not exact vengeance on, or bear any sort of grudge against, the members of your race, but 
will love your neighbour as yourself. I am Yahweh. 

Lev 19:19 ‘You will keep my laws. ‘You will not mate your cattle with those of another kind; you will not sow two 
kinds of grain in your field; you will not wear a garment made from two kinds of fabric. 

Lev 19:20 ‘If someone has intercourse with a woman who is the concubine slave of a man from whom she has 
not been redeemed and she has not been given her freedom, he will be liable for a fine, but they will not incur 
death, since she was not a free woman. 

Lev 19:21 Fie will bring a sacrifice of reparation for Yahweh to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. This will be a 
ram of reparation, 

Lev 19:22 and with the ram of reparation the priest will perform the rite of expiation for him before Yahweh for 
the sin committed; and the sin he has committed will be forgiven. 

Lev 1 9:23 ‘Once you have entered the country and planted any kind of fruit tree, you will regard its fruit as 
uncircumcised. For three years you will count it as uncircumcised and it will not be eaten; 

Lev 19:24 in the fourth year, all its fruit will be consecrated to Yahweh in a feast of praise; 

Lev 19:25 and in the fifth year you may eat its fruit, so that it may yield you even more. I am Yahweh your God. 
Lev 19:26 ‘You will eat nothing with blood in it. You will not practise divination or magic. 

Lev 1 9:27 ‘You will not round off your hair at the edges or trim the edges of your beard. 

Lev 19:28 You will not gash your bodies when someone dies, and you will not tattoo yourselves. I am Yahweh. 
Lev 19:29 ‘Do not profane your daughter by making her a prostitute, or the country itself will become prostituted 
and filled with incest. 

Lev 19:30 ‘You will keep my Sabbaths and revere my sanctuary. I am Yahweh. 

Lev 1 9:31 ‘Do not have recourse to the spirits of the dead or to magicians; they will defile you. I, Yahweh, am 
your God. 

Lev 1 9:32 ‘You will stand up in the presence of grey hair, you will honour the person of the aged and fear your 
God. I am Yahweh. 

Lev 1 9:33 ‘If you have resident aliens in your country, you will not molest them. 

Lev 19:34 You will treat resident aliens as though they were native-born and love them as yourself — for you 



yourselves were once aliens in Egypt. I am Yahweh your God. 

Lev 19:35 ‘You will not be unjust in administering justice as regards measures of length, weight or capacity. 

Lev 1 9:36 You will have just scales, just weights, a just ephah and a just hin. I am Yahweh your God who 
brought you out of Egypt; 

Lev 19:37 hence you are to keep all my laws and all my customs and put them into practice. I am Yahweh’”. 

Lev 20:1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: 

Lev 20:2 “Say to the Israelites: ‘Anyone, be he Israelite or alien resident in Israel, who gives any of his children 
to Molech, will be put to death. The people of the country must stone him, 

Lev 20:3 and I shall set my face against that man and outlaw him from his people; for by giving a child of his to 
Molech he has defiled my sanctuary and profaned my holy name. 

Lev 20:4 If the people of the country choose to close their eyes to the man’s action when he gives a child of his 
to Molech, and do not put him to death, 

Lev 20:5 I myself shall turn my face against that man and his clan. I shall outlaw them from their people, both 
him and all those after him who prostitute themselves by following Molech. 

Lev 20:6 ‘If anyone has recourse to the spirits of the dead or to magicians, to prostitute himself by following 
them, I shall set my face against him and outlaw him from his people. 

Lev 20:7 ‘Sanctify yourselves and be holy, for I am Yahweh your God. 

Lev 20:8 ‘You will keep my laws and put them into practice, for it is I, Yahweh, who make you holy. 

Lev 20:9 Hence: ‘Anyone who curses father or mother will be put to death. Having cursed father or mother, the 
blood will be on that person’s own head. 

Lev 20:10 ‘The man who commits adultery with his neighbour’s wife will be put to death, he and the woman. 

Lev 20:1 1 ‘The man who has intercourse with his father’s wife has infringed his father’s sexual prerogative. Both 
of them will be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. 

Lev 20:12 ‘The man who has intercourse with his daughter-in-law: both of them will be put to death; they have 
violated nature, their blood will be on their own heads. 

Lev 20:13 ‘The man who has intercourse with a man in the same way as with a woman: they have done a 
hateful thing together; they will be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. 

Lev 20:14 ‘The man who marries a woman and her mother: this is incest. They will be burnt alive, he and they; 
you will not tolerate incest. 

Lev 20:15 ‘The man who has intercourse with an animal will be put to death; you will kill the animal too. 

Lev 20:16 ‘The woman who approaches any animal to have intercourse with it: you will kill the woman and the 
animal. They will be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. 

Lev 20:17 ‘The man who marries his father’s or his mother’s daughter: if they have intercourse together, this is 
an outrage. They will be executed in public, for the man has had intercourse with his sister; he will bear the 
consequences of his guilt. 

Lev 20:18 ‘The man who has intercourse with a woman during her monthly periods and exposes her 
nakedness: he has laid bare the source of her blood, and she has exposed the source of her blood, and both of 
them will be outlawed from their people. 

Lev 20:19 ‘You will not have intercourse with your mother’s sister or your father’s sister. Whoëver does so, has 
had intercourse with a close relation; they will bear the consequences of their guilt. 

Lev 20:20 ‘The man who has intercourse with the wife of his paternal uncle has infringed his uncle’s sexual 
prerogative; they will bear the consequences of their guilt and die childless. 

Lev 20:21 ‘The man who marries his brother’s wife: this is pollution; he has infringed his brother’s sexual 
prerogative; they will die childless. 

Lev 20:22 ‘You will keep all my laws, all my decisions, and put them into practice, so that the country where I 
am taking you to live will not vomit you out. 

Lev 20:23 You will not follow the laws of the nations whom I am driving out before you; they practised all these 
things, which is why I detested them. 

Lev 20:24 As I have already told you, you will take possession of their soil, I myself shall give you possession of 
it, a country flowing with milk and honey. ‘Since I, Yahweh your God, have set you apart from these peoples, 

Lev 20:25 you for your part will make a distinction between clean animals and unclean ones and between 
unclean birds and clean ones, and will not make yourselves detestable with any animal or bird or reptile, which I 
have set apart from you as unclean. 

Lev 20:26 ‘Be consecrated to me, for I, Yahweh, am holy, and I shall set you apart from all these peoples, for 
you to be mine. 

Lev 20:27 ‘Any man or woman of yours who is a necromancer or magician will be put to death; they will be 
stoned to death; their blood will be on their own heads’”. 

Lev 21:1 Yahweh said to Moses: “Speak to the priests descended from Aaron and say: ‘None of them must 
make himself unclean by touching the corpse of one of his people, 



Lev 21 :2 unless it be of one of his closest relations-father, mother, son, daughter, brother, 

Lev 21:3 or virgin sister, since she being unmarried is still his close relation: he can make himself unclean for 
her; 

Lev 21 :4 but for a close female relation who is married he will not make himself unclean; he would profane 
himself. 

Lev 21 :5 ‘They will not make tonsures on their heads, shave the edges of their beards, or gash their bodies. 

Lev 21 :6 They will be consecrated to their God and will not profane the name of their God. For their function is 
to offer the food burnt for Yahweh, the food of their God, and so they must be holy. 

Lev 21 :7 ‘They will not marry a woman profaned by prostitution, or one divorced by her husband, for the priest 
is consecrated to his God. 

Lev 21 :8 ‘You will treat him as holy, for he offers the food of your God. For you, he will be a holy person, for I, 
Yahweh, who sanctify you, am holy. 

Lev 21 :9 ‘If a priest’s daughter profanes herself by prostitution, she profanes her father and will be burnt alive. 
Lev 21:10 ‘The priest who is pre-eminent over his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil has been poured, 
and who, robed in the sacred vestments, has received investiture, will not disorder his hair or tear his clothes; 

Lev 21:11 he will not go near any corpse or make himself unclean even for his father or mother. 

Lev 21:12 He will not leave the holy place in such a way as to profane the sanctuary of his God; for he bears the 
consecration of the anointing oil of his God. I am Yahweh. 

Lev 21:13 ‘He will marry a woman who is still a virgin. 

Lev 21:14 He will not marry a woman who has been widowed or divorced or profaned by prostitution, but will 
marry a virgin from his own people: 

Lev 21:15 he must not make his own children profane, for I, Yahweh, have sanctified him’”. 

Lev 21:16 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: 

Lev 21:17 “Speak to Aaron and say: ‘None of your descendants, for all time, may come forward to offer the food 
of his God if he has any infirmity, 

Lev 21:18 for none may come forward if he has an infirmity, be he blind or lame, disfigured or deformed, 

Lev 21:19 or with an injured foot or arm, 

Lev 21 :20 a hunchback, someone with rickets or ophthalmia or the scab or running sores, or a eunuch. 

Lev 21 :21 No descendant of the priest Aaron may come forward to offer the food burnt for Yahweh if he has any 
infirmity; if he has an infirmity, he will not come forward to offer the food of his God. 

Lev 21 :22 ‘He may eat the food of his God, things especially holy and things holy, 

Lev 21 :23 but he will not go near the curtain or approach the altar, since he has an infirmity and must not 
profane my holy things; for I, Yahweh, have sanctified them’”. 

Lev 21:24 And Moses promulgated this to Aaron, to his sons, and to all the Israelites. 

Lev 22:1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: 

Lev 22:2 “Speak to Aaron and his sons. They must be consecrated by the holy offerings of the Israelites and 
must not profane my holy name; for my sake they must sanctify it; I am Yahweh. 

Lev 22:3 Say to them: ‘Any one of your descendants, for all time, who in a state of uncleanness approaches the 
holy offerings consecrated to Yahweh by the Israelites, will be outlawed from my presence. I am Yahweh. 

Lev 22:4 ‘Anyone of Aaron’s line who is afflicted with a contagious skin-disease or a discharge will not eat holy 
things until he is clean. Anyone who touches anything made unclean by a dead body, or who has a seminal 
discharge, 

Lev 22:5 or who is made unclean by touching any kind of reptile or any one who has contaminated him with his 
own uncleanness, be it what it may, 

Lev 22:6 in short, anyone who has had any such contact will be unclean until evening, and must not eat holy 
things until he has washed his body. 

Lev 22:7 At sunset he will be clean and may then eat holy things, for these are his food. 

Lev 22:8 ‘He must not eat an animal that has died a natural death or been savaged; he would contract 
uncleanness from it. I am Yahweh. 

Lev 22:9 ‘They must keep my rules and not burden themselves with sin. If they profane them, they will incur 
death; I, Yahweh, have sanctified them. 

Lev 22:10 ‘No lay person may eat anything holy; no guest or employee of a priest may eat anything holy. 

Lev 22:1 1 But if the priest has acquired a slave by purchase, the slave may eat it like anyone born in his 
household; they will share his food. 

Lev 22:12 ‘If a priest’s daughter marries a layman, she will have no share in the holy things set aside, 

Lev 22:13 but if she is widowed or divorced and, being childless, has had to return to her father’s house as 
when she was young, she may share her father’s food. No lay person may share it; 

Lev 22:14 anyone who does eat a holy thing by inadvertence, will restore it to the priest with one-fifth added. 

Lev 22:15 ‘They may not profane the holy offerings which the Israelites have set aside for Yahweh. 



Lev 22:16 By eating these, they would burden them with guilt requiring a sacrifice of reparation; for I, Yahweh, 
have sanctified these offerings’”. 

Lev 22:17 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: 

Lev 22:18 “Speak to Aaron, to his sons, and to all the Israelites and say: ‘Any member of the House of Israel or 
any alien resident in Israel who brings an offering either in payment of a vow or as a voluntary gift, and offers it 
as a burnt offering to Yahweh, 

Lev 22:19 must, if he is to be acceptable, offer an unblemished male, be it bull or sheep or goat. 

Lev 22:20 You will not offer anything with a blemish, for it would not make you acceptable. 

Lev 22:21 ‘If anyone offers Yahweh a communion sacrifice, either to fulfil a vow or as a voluntary offering, the 
animal, be it from the herd or flock, must be perfect, if he is to be acceptable; it must be unblemished. 

Lev 22:22 You will not offer Yahweh any animal which is blind, lame, mutilated, ulcerous, scabby or covered in 
sores. No part of such an animal will be offered on the altar as food burnt for Yahweh. 

Lev 22:23 As a voluntary offering, you may offer a bull or a lamb that is underdeveloped or deformed; but such 
will not be acceptable in payment of a vow. 

Lev 22:24 You will not offer Yahweh an animal if its testicles have been bruised, crushed, torn or cut off. You 
may not do that in your country, 

Lev 22:25 and you may not accept any such from the hands of a stranger, to be offered as food for your God. 
Their deformity is a blemish, and they would not make you acceptable’”. 

Lev 22:26 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: 

Lev 22:27 “A calf, lamb, or kid will stay with its dam for seven days after being born. From the eighth day 
onwards, it will be acceptable as food burnt for Yahweh. 

Lev 22:28 But no animal, whether cow or ewe, will be slaughtered on the same day as its young. 

Lev 22:29 “If you offer Yahweh a sacrifice with praise, do it in the acceptable manner; 

Lev 22:30 it must be eaten the same day; you will leave nothing over till next morning. I am Yahweh. 

Lev 22:31 “You will keep my commands and put them into practice. I am Yahweh. 

Lev 22:32 You will not profane my holy name — so that I may be honoured as holy among the Israelites, I, 
Yahweh, who make you holy, 

Lev 22:33 I who brought you out of Egypt, to be your God, I, Yahweh”. 

Lev 23:1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: 

Lev 23:2 “Speak to the Israelites and say: (The solemn festivals of Yahweh to which you will summon them are 
my sacred assemblies.) ‘These are my solemn festivals: 

Lev 23:3 ‘You will work for six days, but the seventh will be a day of complete rest, a day for the sacred 
assembly on which you do no work at all. Wherever you live, this is a Sabbath for Yahweh. 

Lev 23:4 ‘These are Yahweh’s solemn festivals, the sacred assemblies to which you will summon the Israelites 
on the appointed day: 

Lev 23:5 ‘The fourteenth day of the first month, at twilight, is the Passover of Yahweh; 

Lev 23:6 and the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of Unleavened Bread for Yahweh. For seven days 
you will eat unleavened bread. 

Lev 23:7 On the first day you will hold a sacred assembly; you will do no heavy work. 

Lev 23:8 For seven days you will offer food burnt for Yahweh. On the seventh day there will be a sacred 
assembly; you will do no heavy work’”. 

Lev 23:9 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: 

Lev 23:10 “Speak to the Israelites and say: ‘When you enter the country which I am giving you and reap the 
harvest there, you will bring the priest the first sheaf of your harvest, 

Lev 23:1 1 and he will present it to Yahweh with the gesture of offering, for you to be acceptable. The priest will 
make this offering on the day after the Sabbath, 

Lev 23:12 and on the same day as you make this offering, you will offer Yahweh an unblemished lamb one year 
old as a burnt offering. 

Lev 23:13 The cereal offering for that day will be two-tenths of wheaten flour mixed with oil, as food burnt as a 
smell pleasing to Yahweh. The libation will be a quarter of a hin of wine. 

Lev 23:14 You will eat no bread, roasted ears of wheat or fresh produce before this day, before making the 
offering to your God. This is a perpetual law for all your descendants, wherever you live. 

Lev 23:15 ‘From the day after the Sabbath, the day on which you bring the sheaf of offering, you will count 
seven full weeks. 

Lev 23:16 You will count fifty days, to the day after the seventh Sabbath, and then you will offer Yahweh a new 
cereal offering. 

Lev 23:17 You will bring bread from your homes to present with the gesture of offering — two loaves, made of 
two-tenths of wheaten flour baked with leaven; these are first-fruits for Yahweh. 

Lev 23:18 In addition to the bread, you will offer seven unblemished lambs a year old, a young bull and two 



rams, as a burnt offering to Yahweh with a cereal offering and a libation, as food burnt as a smell pleasing to 
Yahweh. 

Lev 23:19 You will also offer a goat as a sacrifice for sin, and two lambs a year old as communion sacrifice. 

Lev 23:20 The priest will present them before Yahweh with the gesture of offering, in addition to the bread of the 
first-fruits. These, and the two lambs, are holy things for Yahweh, and will revert to the priest. 

Lev 23:21 ‘On the same day, you will hold an assembly; for you this will be a sacred assembly; you will do no 
heavy work. This is a perpetual law for your descendants, wherever you live. 

Lev 23:22 ‘When you reap the harvest in your country, you will not reap to the very edges of your field, nor will 
you gather the gleanings of the harvest. You will leave them for the poor and the stranger. I am Yahweh your 
God’”. 

Lev 23:23 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: 

Lev 23:24 “Speak to the Israelites and say: ‘The first day of the seventh month will be a day of rest for you, of 
remembrance and acclamation, a sacred assembly. 

Lev 23:25 You will do no heavy work and you will offer food burnt for Yahweh’. 1 
Lev 23:26 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: 

Lev 23:27 “But the tenth day of this seventh month will be the Day of Expiation. You will hold a sacred assembly. 
You will fast and offer food burnt for Yahweh. 

Lev 23:28 You will do no work that day, for it is the Day of Expiation, on which the rite of expiation will be 
performed for you before Yahweh your God. 

Lev 23:29 Anyone who fails to fast that day will be outlawed from his people; 

Lev 23:30 anyone who works that day I shall eliminate from his people. 

Lev 23:31 No work will be done — this is a perpetual law for your descendants wherever you live. 

Lev 23:32 It must be a day of complete rest for you. You will fast; on the evening of the ninth day of the month, 
from this evening till the following evening, you will rest completely”. 

Lev 23:33 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: 

Lev 23:34 “Speak to the Israelites and say: ‘On the fifteenth day of this seventh month there will be the feast of 
Shelters for Yahweh, lasting for seven days. 

Lev 23:35 The first day will be a day of sacred assembly; you will do no heavy work. 

Lev 23:36 For seven days you will offer food burnt for Yahweh. On the eighth day you will hold a sacred 
assembly and you will offer food burnt for Yahweh. It is a day of solemn meeting; you will do no heavy work. 

Lev 23:37 ‘These are Yahweh’s solemn festivals to which you will summon the Israelites, the sacred assemblies 
for the purpose of offering food burnt for Yahweh, consisting of burnt offerings, cereal offerings, sacrifices and 
libations, each on its appropriate day, 

Lev 23:38 besides Yahweh’s Sabbaths, and your presents and all your votive and voluntary gifts that you make 
to Yahweh. 

Lev 23:39 ‘But on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the produce of the land, 
you will celebrate the feast of Yahweh for seven days. The first and eighth days will be days of rest. 

Lev 23:40 On the first day you will take choice fruit, palm branches, boughs of leafy trees and flowering shrubs 
from the river bank, and for seven days enjoy yourselves before Yahweh your God. 

Lev 23:41 You will celebrate a feast for Yahweh in this way for seven days every year. This is a perpetual law 
for your descendants. ‘You will keep this feast in the seventh month. 

Lev 23:42 For seven days you will live in shelters: all the citizens of Israel will live in shelters, 

Lev 23:43 so that your descendants may know that I made the Israelites live in shelters when I brought them out 
of Egypt, I, Yahweh your God’”. 

Lev 23:44 Moses then promulgated Yahweh’s solemn festivals to the Israelites. 

Lev 24:1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: 

Lev 24:2 “Order the Israelites to bring you crushed-olive oil for the lamp-stand, and keep a flame burning there 
continually. 

Lev 24:3 Aaron will keep it permanently in trim from evening to morning, outside the curtain of the Testimony in 
the Tent of Meeting, before Yahweh. This is a perpetual decree for your descendants: 

Lev 24:4 Aaron will keep the lamps permanently trimmed on the pure lamp-stand before Yahweh. 

Lev 24:5 “You will take wheaten flour and with it bake twelve loaves, each of two-tenths of an ephah. 

Lev 24:6 You will then place them in two rows of six on the pure table before Yahweh 

Lev 24:7 and put pure incense on each row, to make it food offered as a memorial, food burnt for Yahweh. 

Lev 24:8 Every Sabbath they will be arranged before Yahweh. The Israelites will provide them as a permanent 
covenant. 

Lev 24:9 They will belong to Aaron and his sons, who will eat them inside the holy place since, for him, they are 
an especially holy part of the food burnt for Yahweh. This is a permanent law”. 

Lev 24:10 There was a man whose mother was an Israelite woman and whose father was an Egyptian. He 



came out of his house and, in the camp, surrounded by the Israelites, he began to quarrel with a man who was 
an Israelite. 

Lev 24:1 1 Now the son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name and cursed it. He was then taken to 
Moses (his mother’s name was Shelomith daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan). 

Lev 24:12 He was then put under guard until Yahweh’s will should be made clear to them. 

Lev 24:13 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: 

Lev 24:14 Take the man who pronounced the curse outside the camp. All those who heard him must then lay 
their hands on his head, and the whole community must then stone him. 

Lev 24:15 Then say to the Israelites: ‘Anyone who curses his God will bear the consequences of his sin, 

Lev 24:16 and anyone who blasphemes the name of Yahweh will be put to death; the whole community will 
stone him; be he alien or native-born, if he blasphemes the Name, he will be put to death. 

Lev 24:17 ‘Anyone who strikes down any other human being will be put to death. 

Lev 24:18 ‘Anyone who strikes down an animal will make restitution for it: a life for a life. 

Lev 24:19 ‘Anyone who injures a neighbour shall receive the same in return, 

Lev 24:20 broken limb for broken limb, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. As the injury inflicted, so will be the injury 
suffered. 

Lev 24:21 Whoëver strikes down an animal will make restitution for it, and whoëver strikes down a human being 
will be put to death. 

Lev 24:22 The sentence you pass will be the same, whether on native-born or on alien; for I am Yahweh your 
God’”. 

Lev 24:23 Moses having told the Israelites this, they took the man who had pronounced the curse out of the 
camp and stoned him. And so the Israelites carried out Yahweh’s order to Moses. 

Lev 25:1 Yahweh spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai and said: 

Lev 25:2 “Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘When you enter the country which I am giving you, the land 
must keep a Sabbath’s rest for Yahweh. 

Lev 25:3 For six years you will sow your field, for six years you will prune your vineyard and gather its produce. 
Lev 25:4 But in the seventh year the land will have a sabbatical rest, a Sabbath for Yahweh. You will neither 
sow your field, nor prune your vineyard, 

Lev 25:5 nor reap any grain which has grown of its own accord, nor gather the grapes from your untrimmed 
vine. It will be a year of rest for the land. 

Lev 25:6 But what the land produces in its Sabbath will serve to feed you, your slave, male or female, your 
employee and your guest residing with you; 

Lev 25:7 for your cattle too, and the wild animals of your country, whatever it produces will serve as food. 

Lev 25:8 ‘You will count seven weeks of years — seven times seven years, that is to say a period of seven 
weeks of years, forty-nine years. 

Lev 25:9 And on the tenth day of the seventh month you will sound the trumpet; on the Day of Expiation you will 
sound the trumpet throughout the land. 

Lev 25:10 You will declare this fiftieth year to be sacred and proclaim the liberation of all the country’s 
inhabitants. You will keep this as a jubilee: each of you will return to his ancestral property, each to his own clan. 
Lev 25:1 1 This fiftieth year will be a jubilee year for you; in it you will not sow, you will not harvest the grain that 
has come up on its own or in it gather grapes from your untrimmed vine. 

Lev 25:12 The jubilee will be a holy thing for you; during it you will eat whatever the fields produce. 

Lev 25:13 ‘In this year of jubilee, each of you will return to his ancestral property. 

Lev 25:14 If you buy land from, or sell land to, your fellow-countryman, neither of you may exploit the other. 

Lev 25:15 In buying from your fellow-countryman, you will take account of the number of years since the jubilee; 
the sale-price he fixes for you will depend on the number of productive years still to run. 

Lev 25:16 The greater the number of years, the higher the price you will ask for it; the fewer the number of 
years, the greater the reduction; for what he is selling you is a certain number of harvests. 

Lev 25:17 So you will not exploit one another, but fear your God, for I am Yahweh your God. 

Lev 25:18 ‘Hence, you will put my laws and customs into practice; you will keep them and put them into 
practice, and you will live securely in the country. 

Lev 25:19 The land will give its fruit, and you will eat your fill and live in security. 

Lev 25:20 ‘In case you should ask: What shall we eat in this seventh year if we do not sow or harvest our 
produce? 

Lev 25:21 I shall order my blessing to be on you in the sixth year, which will yield you enough produce for three 
years. 

Lev 25:22 You will have the old produce to eat while you are sowing in the eighth year, and even in the ninth 
year, you will be eating the old produce, while waiting for the harvest of that year. 

Lev 25:23 ‘Land will not be sold absolutely, for the land belongs to me, and you are only strangers and guests 



of mine. 

Lev 25:24 You will allow a right of redemption over any ancestral property. 

Lev 25:25 If your brother becomes impoverished and sells off part of his ancestral property, his nearest male 
relative will come and exercise his family rights over what his brother has sold. 

Lev 25:26 The man who has no one to exercise this right may, once he has found the means to effect the 
redemption, 

Lev 25:27 calculate the number of years that the alienation would have lasted, repay to the purchaser the sum 
due for the time still to run, and so recover his ancestral property. 

Lev 25:28 If he cannot find the sum in compensation, the property sold will remain in the possession of the 
purchaser until the jubilee year. In the jubilee year, the latter will vacate it and return to his own ancestral 
property. 

Lev 25:29 ‘If anyone sells a dwelling house inside a walled town, he will have the right of redemption until the 
expiry of the year following the sale. His right of redemption is limited to the year; 

Lev 25:30 and if the redemption has not been effected by the end of the year, the house in the walled town will 
become the property of the purchaser and his descendants in perpetuity; he need not vacate it at the jubilee. 

Lev 25:31 But houses in villages not enclosed by walls will be considered as situated in the open country; they 
carry the right of redemption, and the purchaser will vacate them at the jubilee. 

Lev 25:32 ‘As regards the towns of the Levites, town houses forming part of their ancestral property will carry a 
perpetual right of redemption in their favour. 

Lev 25:33 If a Levite is the one to be affected by the right of redemption, at the jubilee he will vacate the 
purchased property and return to his own home, to the town in which he has a title to property. The houses in the 
Levites’ towns represent their ancestral property in Israel, 

Lev 25:34 and the arable land depending on these towns cannot be sold, being their ancestral property for ever. 
Lev 25:35 ‘If your brother becomes impoverished and cannot support himself in the community, you will assist 
him as you would a stranger or guest, so that he can go on living with you. 

Lev 25:36 Do not charge him interest on a loan, but fear your God, and let your brother live with you. 

Lev 25:37 You will not lend him money on interest or give him food to make a profit out of it. 

Lev 25:38 I am Yahweh your God who brought you out of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and be your 
God. 

Lev 25:39 ‘If your brother becomes impoverished while with you and sells himself to you, you will not make him 
do the work of a slave; 

Lev 25:40 you will treat him like an employee or guest, and he will work for you until the jubilee year. 

Lev 25:41 He will then leave you, both he and his children, and return to his clan and regain possession of his 
ancestral property. 

Lev 25:42 For they are my servants whom I have brought out of Egypt, and they may not be bought and sold as 
slaves. 

Lev 25:43 You will not oppress your brother-lsraelites harshly but will fear your God. 

Lev 25:44 ‘The male and female slaves you have will come from the nations round you; from these you may 
purchase male and female slaves. 

Lev 25:45 As slaves, you may also purchase the children of aliens resident among you, and also members of 
their families living with you who have been born on your soil; and they will become your property, 

Lev 25:46 and you may leave them as a legacy to your sons after you as their perpetual possession. These you 
may have for slaves; but you will not oppress your brother-lsraelites. 

Lev 25:47 ‘If a stranger or guest living with you gets rich and your brother, in the course of dealings with him, 
becomes impoverished and sells himself to this stranger or guest, or to the descendant of a stranger’s family, 

Lev 25:48 he will enjoy the right of redemption after being sold, and one of his brothers may redeem him. 

Lev 25:49 His paternal uncle, his uncle’s son, or a member of his own family may redeem him; if he has the 
means, he may redeem himself. 

Lev 25:50 By agreement with his purchaser, he will count the number of years between the year of sale and the 
jubilee year; his sale-price will be proportionate to the number of years, his time being valued as that of an 
employee. 

Lev 25:51 If there are still many years to run, in proportion to their number he will refund part of his sale-price as 
payment for his redemption. 

Lev 25:52 And if there are only a few years still to run before the jubilee year, he will calculate with him what 
should be refunded for his redemption, in proportion to their number, 

Lev 25:53 as though he were hired by the year. You will see to it that he is not harshly oppressed. 

Lev 25:54 ‘If he has not been redeemed in any of these ways, he will go free in the jubilee year, both he and his 
children; 

Lev 25:55 for the Israelites are my servants; they are my servants whom I brought out of Egypt. I am Yahweh 



your God’”. 

Lev 26:1 “‘You will not make idols for yourselves; you will not erect statues or cultic stones, or erect carved 
stones in your country, for you to worship: for I, Yahweh, am your God. 

Lev 26:2 You will keep my Sabbaths and revere my sanctuary. I am Yahweh. 

Lev 26:3 ‘If you live according to my laws, if you keep my commandments and put them into practice, 

Lev 26:4 I shall give you the rain you need at the right time; the soil will yield its produce and the trees of the 
countryside their fruit; 

Lev 26:5 you will thresh until vintage time and gather grapes until sowing time. You will eat your fill of bread and 
live secure in your land. 

Lev 26:6 ‘I shall give peace in the land, and you will go to sleep with no one to frighten you. I shall rid the land of 
beasts of prey. The sword will not pass through your land. 

Lev 26:7 You will pursue your enemies and they will fall before your sword; 

Lev 26:8 five of you pursuing a hundred of them, one hundred pursuing ten thousand; and your enemies will fall 
before your sword. 

Lev 26:9 ‘I shall turn towards you, I shall make you fertile and make your numbers grow, and I shall uphold my 
covenant with you. 

Lev 26:10 ‘Having eaten all you need of last year’s harvest, you will throw out the old to make room for the new. 
Lev 26:1 1 ‘I shall fix my home among you and never reject you. 

Lev 26:12 I shall live among you; I shall be your God and you will be my people, 

Lev 26:13 I, Yahweh your God, who brought you out of Egypt so that you should be their slaves no longer, and 
who broke the bonds of your yoke and made you walk with head held high. 

Lev 26:14 ‘But if you will not listen to me and do not put all these commandments into practice, 

Lev 26:15 if you reject my laws and detest my customs, and you break my covenant by not putting all my 
commandments into practice, 

Lev 26:16 this is how I shall treat you: ‘I shall subject you to terror, consumption and fever, making you dim of 
sight and short of breath. You will sow your seed in vain, for your enemies will eat it. 

Lev 26:17 I shall turn against you and you will be defeated by your enemies. Your foes will have the mastery 
over you, and you will flee when no one is pursuing you. 

Lev 26:18 ‘And if, in spite of this, you will not listen to me, I shall punish you seven times over for your sins. 

Lev 26:19 I shall break your proud strength. I shall make the sky like iron for you, and your soil like bronze. 

Lev 26:20 You will wear out your strength in vain, your land will not yield its produce, nor the trees of the country 
their fruit. 

Lev 26:21 ‘And if you go against me and will not listen to me, I shall heap seven times more plagues on you for 
your sins. 

Lev 26:22 I shall send wild animals to attack you and rob you of your children, destroy your cattle and reduce 
your numbers until your roads are deserted. 

Lev 26:23 ‘And if that does not reform you, and you still go against me, 

Lev 26:24 then I shall go against you and punish you another seven times over for your sins. 

Lev 26:25 I shall bring the sword on you, which will avenge the covenant, and when you huddle inside your 
towns, I shall send pestilence among you, and you will fall into the enemy’s clutches. 

Lev 26:26 When I take away the bread which supports you, ten women will be able to bake your bread in one 
oven and will then dole your bread out by weight; you will eat but not be satisfied. 

Lev 26:27 ‘And if, in spite of this, you will not listen to me but go against me, 

Lev 26:28 I shall go against you in fury and punish you seven times over for your sins. 

Lev 26:29 You will eat the flesh of your own sons, you will eat the flesh of your own daughters. 

Lev 26:30 I shall destroy your high places and smash your incense-altars; I shall pile your corpses on the 
corpses of your foul idols and shall reject you. 

Lev 26:31 I shall reduce your cities to ruins; I shall lay waste your sanctuary and refuse to inhale from you 
smells intended to please. 

Lev 26:32 I shall make such a desolation of the country that your enemies who come to live there will be 
appalled by it. 

Lev 26:33 And I shall scatter you among the nations. I shall unsheathe the sword against you, reducing your 
country to desert and your towns to ruins. 

Lev 26:34 Then the country will indeed observe its Sabbaths, all the while it lies deserted, while you are in the 
country of your enemies. Then indeed the country will rest and observe its Sabbaths. 

Lev 26:35 And as it lies deserted it will rest, as it never did on your Sabbaths when you were living there. 

Lev 26:36 I shall strike such fear into the hearts of those of you who survive in the countries of their enemies 
that the sound of a falling leaf will set them fleeing; they will flee as though fleeing from the sword, and fall when 
no one is pursuing. 



Lev 26:37 They will stumble over one another as though fleeing before the sword, when no one is pursuing. You 
will be powerless to stand up to your enemies; 

Lev 26:38 you will perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies will swallow you up. 

Lev 26:39 Those of you who survive will pine away in their guilt in the countries of their enemies and, bearing 
the guilt of their ancestors too, will pine away like them. 

Lev 26:40 ‘Then they shall admit their guilt and that of their ancestors and their infidelities against me, and 
further, their setting themselves against me. 

Lev 26:41 ‘I in my turn will go against them and bring them into the land of their enemies. Then their 
uncircumcised hearts will grow humble and then they will accept the punishment for their guilt. 

Lev 26:42 I shall remember my covenant with Jacob, I shall remember my covenant with Isaac and my 
covenant with Abraham; and I shall remember the country too. 

Lev 26:43 ‘Abandoned, the country will keep its Sabbaths, as it lies deserted in their absence, and they will 
have to accept the punishment for their guilt, since they detested my customs and rejected my laws. 

Lev 26:44 ‘Yet, in spite of all this, when they are in the land of their enemies, I shall not so utterly reject or 
detest them as to destroy them completely and break my covenant with them; for I am Yahweh their God. 

Lev 26:45 For their sake I shall remember the covenant I made with those first generations that I brought out of 
Egypt while other nations watched, so that I should be their God, I, Yahweh’”. 

Lev 26:46 Such were the decrees, customs and laws which Yahweh established between himself and the 
Israelites on Mount Sinai through Moses. 

Lev 27:1 Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: 

Lev 27:2 “Speak to the Israelites and say: ‘If anyone vows the value of a person to Yahweh and wishes to 
discharge the vow: 

Lev 27:3 ‘a man between twenty and sixty years of age will be valued at fifty silver shekels — the sanctuary 
shekel; 

Lev 27:4 a woman will be valued at thirty shekels; 

Lev 27:5 ‘between five and twenty years, a boy will be valued at twenty shekels, a girl at ten shekels; 

Lev 27:6 ‘between one month and five years, a boy will be valued at five silver shekels, a girl at three silver 
shekels; 

Lev 27:7 ‘at sixty years and over, a man will be valued at fifteen shekels and a woman at ten shekels. 

Lev 27:8 ‘If the person who made the vow cannot meet this valuation, he will present the person concerned to 
the priest, and the priest will set a value proportionate to the resources of the person who made the vow. 

Lev 27:9 ‘In the case of an animal suitable for offering to Yahweh, any such animal given to Yahweh will be 
holy. 

Lev 27:10 It cannot be exchanged or replaced, a good one instead of a bad one, or a bad one instead of a good 
one. If one animal is substituted for another, both of them will become holy. 

Lev 27:1 1 In the case of an unclean animal unsuitable for offering to Yahweh, whatever it may be, it will be 
presented to the priest 

Lev 27:12 and he will set a value on it, in relation to its worth. His valuation will be decisive; 

Lev 27:13 but if the person wishes to redeem it, he will add one-fifth to the valuation. 

Lev 27:14 ‘If a man consecrates his house to Yahweh, the priest will set a value on it, in relation to its worth. His 
valuation will be decisive. 

Lev 27:15 If the man who has vowed his house wishes to redeem it, he will add one-fifth to the valuation, and it 
will revert to him. 

Lev 27:16 ‘If a man consecrates one of the fields of his ancestral property to Yahweh, its value will be 
calculated in terms of its yield, at the rate of fifty silver shekels to one homer of barley. 

Lev 27:17 ‘If he consecrates the field during the jubilee year, he will abide by this valuation. 

Lev 27:18 But if he consecrates it after the jubilee, the priest will calculate the price in terms of the number of 
years still to run until the next jubilee and the valuation will be reduced accordingly. 

Lev 27:19 ‘If he wishes to redeem the field, he will add one-fifth to the valuation, and the field will revert to him. 
Lev 27:20 If he does not redeem it but sells it to someone else, the right of redemption ceases; 

Lev 27:21 when the purchaser has to vacate it at the jubilee year, it becomes consecrated to Yahweh, like a 
field vowed unconditionally; ownership of it passes to the priest. 

Lev 27:22 ‘If he consecrates to Yahweh a field which he has bought, but which is not part of his ancestral 
property, 

Lev 27:23 the priest will calculate the valuation in terms of the number of years still to run before the jubilee 
year; and the man will pay this sum the same day since it is consecrated to Yahweh. 

Lev 27:24 In the jubilee year the field will revert to the vendor, the man to whose ancestral property the land 
belongs. 

Lev 27:25 All your valuations will be made in sanctuary shekels, at the rate of twenty gerah to the shekel. 



Lev 27:26 ‘The first-born of livestock is born to Yahweh; no one may consecrate it, whether it be cattle or 
sheep, for it belongs to Yahweh anyway. 

Lev 27:27 But if it is an unclean animal, it may be redeemed at the valuation price with one-fifth added; if the 
animal is not redeemed, it will be sold at the valuation price. 

Lev 27:28 ‘Nothing, however, that someone vows unconditionally to Yahweh may be redeemed, nothing he 
possesses, be it a human being or animal or field of his ancestral property. What is vowed unconditionally is 
especially holy and belongs to Yahweh. 

Lev 27:29 A human being vowed unconditionally cannot be redeemed but will be put to death. 

Lev 27:30 ‘All tithes on land, levied on the produce of the soil or on the fruit of trees, belong to Yahweh; they are 
consecrated to Yahweh. 

Lev 27:31 If anyone wishes to redeem part of his tithe, he will add one-fifth to its value. 

Lev 27:32 ‘In all tithes on herds or flocks, the tenth animal of all that pass under the herdsman’s staff will be 
consecrated to Yahweh; 

Lev 27:33 there will be no examining whether it is good or bad, and no substitution. If substitution takes place, 

the animal and its substitute will both become holy without possibility of redemption’. 1 

Lev 27:34 Such were the orders which Yahweh gave Moses on Mount Sinai for the Israelites.
