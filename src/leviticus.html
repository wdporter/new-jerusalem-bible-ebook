<h2 id="i">I: The Ritual of Sacrifice (1:1–7:38)</h2>

<h4>The burnt offering (1:1–17)</h4>

<p>Yahweh summoned Moses and, speaking to him from the Tent of Meeting, said, “Speak to the Israelites; say to them, ‘When any of you brings an offering to Yahweh, he can offer an animal either from the herd or from the flock.</p>

<p>‘If his offering is to be a burnt offering from the herd, he must offer an unblemished male; he will offer it at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, to make it acceptable to Yahweh. He must lay his hand on the victim’s head, and it will be accepted as effectual for his expiation. He will then slaughter the bull before Yahweh, and the priests descended from Aaron will offer the blood. They will pour it all around the altar which stands at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. He will then skin the victim and quarter it. The priests descended from Aaron will put a fire on the altar and arrange wood on the fire. The priests descended from Aaron will then arrange the quarters, the head and the fat on the wood on the fire on the altar. He will wash the entrails and shins in water, and the priest will burn it all on the altar as a burnt offering, food burnt as a smell pleasing to Yahweh. </p>

<p>‘If his offering is to be of an animal from the flock, of a lamb or a goat to be offered as a burnt offering, he must offer an unblemished male. He will slaughter it on the north side of the altar, before Yahweh, and the priests descended from Aaron will pour the blood all around the altar. He will then quarter it, and the priest will arrange the quarters, the head and the fat on the wood on the fire on the altar. He will wash the entrails and shins in water, and the priest will burn it all on the altar as a burnt offering, food burnt as a smell pleasing to Yahweh. </p>

<p>‘If his offering to Yahweh is to be a burnt offering of a bird, he must offer a turtledove or a young pigeon. The priest will offer it at the altar and wring off its head, which he will burn on the altar; its blood must then be squeezed out on the side of the altar. He will then remove the crop and the feathers and throw them on the eastern side of the altar, where the fatty ashes are put. He will then split it in half with a wing on each side, but without separating the two parts. The priest will then burn it on the altar, on the wood which is on the fire, as a burnt offering, food burnt as a smell pleasing to Yahweh. </p>

<h4>The cereal offering (2:1–16)</h4>

<p>‘If anyone offers Yahweh a cereal offering, his offering must consist of wheaten flour on which he must pour wine and put incense. He will bring it to the priests descended from Aaron; he will take a handful of the wheaten flour, some of the oil and all the incense, and this the priest will burn on the altar as a memorial, as food burnt as a smell pleasing to Yahweh. The remainder of the cereal offering will revert to Aaron and his sons, an especially holy portion of the food burnt for Yahweh. </p>

<p>‘When you offer a cereal offering of dough baked in the oven, the wheaten flour must be prepared either in the form of unleavened cakes mixed with oil, or in the form of unleavened wafers spread with oil. </p>

<p>‘If your offering is a cereal offering cooked on the griddle, the wheaten flour mixed with oil must contain no leaven. You will break it in pieces and pour oil over it. It is a cereal offering. </p>

<p>‘If your offering is a cereal offering cooked in the pan, the wheaten flour must be prepared with oil. </p>

<p>‘You will bring Yahweh the cereal offering thus prepared and present it to the priest; he will take it to the altar. And from the cereal offering the priest will take the memorial and burn it on the altar, food burnt as a smell pleasing to Yahweh. The remainder of the cereal offering will revert to Aaron and his descendants: it is especially holy since it is taken from the food burnt for Yahweh. </p>

<p>‘None of the cereal offerings which you offer to Yahweh must be prepared with leaven, for you must never include leaven or honey in food burnt for Yahweh. You may offer them to Yahweh as an offering of first-fruits, but they will not make a pleasing smell if they are burnt on the altar. You will put salt in every cereal offering that you offer, and you will not fail to put the salt of the covenant of your God on your cereal offering; to every offering you will add an offering of salt to your God. If you offer Yahweh a cereal offering of first-fruits, you will offer it in the form of roasted ears of wheat or of bread made from ground wheat. You will add oil to it and put incense on it; it is a cereal offering; and from it the priest will burn the memorial with some bread and oil (and all the incense) as food burnt for Yahweh. </p>

<h4>The communion sacrifice (3:1–17)</h4>

<p>‘If his sacrifice is a communion sacrifice, and if he offers an animal from the herd, be it male or female, whatever he offers before Yahweh must be unblemished. He will lay his hand on the victim’s head and slaughter it at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. The priests descended from Aaron will then pour the blood all around the altar. He will offer part of the communion sacrifice as food burnt for Yahweh: the fat covering the entrails, all the fat on the entrails, both kidneys, the fat on them and on the loins, the mass of fat which he will remove from the liver and kidneys. The priests descended from Aaron will then burn this on the altar, in addition to the burnt offering, on the wood of the fire, food burnt as a smell pleasing to Yahweh. </p>

<p>‘If it is an animal from the flock which he offers as a communion sacrifice to Yahweh, be the animal that he offers male or female, it must be unblemished. </p>

<p>‘If he offers a sheep, he will offer it before Yahweh, he will lay his hand on the victim’s head and slaughter it in front of the Tent of Meeting; the priests descended from Aaron will then pour its blood all around the altar. Of the communion sacrifice he will offer the following as food burnt for Yahweh: the fat, all the tail taken off near the base of the spine, the fat covering the entrails, all the fat on the entrails, both kidneys, the fat on them and on the loins, the mass of fat which he will remove from the liver and kidneys. The priest will then burn this on the altar as food, as food burnt for Yahweh. </p>

<p>‘If his offering is a goat, he will offer it before Yahweh, he will lay his hand on the victim’s head and slaughter it in front of the Tent of Meeting, and the descendants of Aaron will then pour its blood all around the altar. This is what he will then offer of it as food burnt for Yahweh: the fat covering the entrails, all the fat on the entrails, both kidneys, the fat on them and on the loins, the mass of fat which he will remove from the liver and kidneys. The priest will then burn these pieces on the altar as food burnt as a smell pleasing to Yahweh. </p>

<p>‘All the fat belongs to Yahweh. This is a perpetual law for all your descendants, wherever you may live: that you will not eat either fat or blood’”. </p>

<h4>The sacrifice for sin: (4:1–35)</h4>

<h5>a: of the high priest (4:1–12)</h5>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Speak to the Israelites and say: </p>

<p>“‘If anyone sins inadvertently against any of Yahweh’s commandments and does anything prohibited by them, if the one who sins is the anointed priest, thus making the people guilty, then for the sin which he has committed he must offer Yahweh a young bull, an unblemished animal from the herd, as a sacrifice for sin. He will bring the bull before Yahweh at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, will lay his hand on its head and slaughter it before Yahweh. The anointed priest will then take some of the bull’s blood and carry it into the Tent of Meeting. He will then dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times in front of the sanctuary curtain, before Yahweh. The priest will then put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of incense smoking before Yahweh in the Tent of Meeting, and will pour all the rest of the bull’s blood at the foot of the altar of burnt offerings at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. </p>

<p>‘Of the bull offered as a sacrifice for sin, he will set aside all the fat: the fat covering the entrails, all the fat on the entrails, both kidneys, the fat on them and on the loins, the mass of fat which he will remove from the liver and kidneys — exactly as was done with the portion set aside in the communion sacrifice — and the priest will burn these pieces on the altar of burnt offerings. </p>

<p>‘The bull’s skin and all its meat, its head, its shins, its entrails and its offal, the whole bull he will then have carried out of the camp to a clean place, the place where the fatty ashes are thrown, and will burn it on a wood fire; it must be burnt where the ashes are thrown. </p>

<h5>b: of the community of Israel (4:13–21)</h5>

<p>‘If the whole community of Israel has sinned inadvertently and, without being aware of it has incurred guilt by doing something forbidden by Yahweh’s commandments, once the sin of which it is guilty has been discovered, the community must offer a young bull, an unblemished animal from the herd, as a sacrifice for sin, and bring it in front of the Tent of Meeting. The elders of the community will then lay their hands on the bull’s head before Yahweh, and the bull will be slaughtered before Yahweh. </p>

<p>‘The anointed priest will then take some of the bull’s blood into the Tent of Meeting. He will then dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times in front of the curtain, before Yahweh. He will then put some of the blood on the horns of the altar standing before Yahweh inside the Tent of Meeting, and then pour all the rest of the blood at the foot of the altar of burnt offerings at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. </p>

<p>‘He will then set aside all the fat from the animal and burn it on the altar. He will then deal with the bull as he did with the bull in the sacrifice for sin. It will be dealt with in the same way; and once the priest has performed the rite of expiation for the people, they will be forgiven. </p>

<p>‘He will then have the bull carried out of the camp and will burn it as he burned the first one. This is the sacrifice for the sin of the community. </p>

<h5>c: of a leader of the community (4:22–26)</h5>

<p>‘When a leader has sinned and inadvertently incurred guilt by doing something forbidden by the commandments of Yahweh his God (or if the sin which he has committed is drawn to his attention), he must bring a he-goat as his offering, an unblemished male. He will then lay his hand on the goat’s head and slaughter it on the spot where the burnt offerings are slaughtered before Yahweh. This is a sacrifice for sin; the priest will take some of the victim’s blood on his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offerings. He will then pour the rest of its blood at the foot of the altar of burnt offerings and burn all the fat on the altar, as with the fat in the communion sacrifice. This is how the priest must perform the rite of expiation for him to free him from his sin, and he will be forgiven. </p>

<h5>d: of a private individual (4:27–35)</h5>

<p>‘If one of the country people sins inadvertently and incurs guilt by doing something forbidden by Yahweh’s commandments (or if the sin which he has committed is drawn to his attention), he must bring a she-goat as his offering for the sin which he has committed, an unblemished female. He will then lay his hand on the victim’s head and slaughter it on the spot where the burnt offerings are slaughtered. The priest will take some of its blood on his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offerings. He will then pour all the rest of the blood at the foot of the altar. He will then remove all the fat, as the fat was removed for the communion sacrifice, and the priest will burn it on the altar as a smell pleasing to Yahweh. This is how the priest must perform the rite of expiation for him, and he will be forgiven. </p>

<p>‘If he wishes to bring a lamb as an offering for this kind of sacrifice, he must bring an unblemished female. He will then lay his hand on the victim’s head and slaughter it as a sacrifice for sin on the spot where the burnt offerings are slaughtered. The priest will take some of the victim’s blood on his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offerings. He will then pour all the rest of the blood at the foot of the altar. He will then remove all the fat, as was done for the sheep in the communion sacrifice, and the priest will burn it as food burnt for Yahweh. This is how the priest must perform for him the rite of expiation for the sin which he has committed, and he will be forgiven. </p>

<h4>Some cases of sacrifice for sin (5:1–6)</h4>

<p>‘If someone sins in any of these following cases: </p>

<p>‘He should have come forward to give evidence when he heard the formal adjuration, having seen the incident or known the facts; but he has not spoken out, and so bears the consequences of his guilt; </p>

<p>‘or someone touches something unclean, whatever it may be — the dead body of an unclean animal, wild or tame, or of one of the unclean reptiles — and without realising it becomes unclean, he becomes answerable for it; </p>

<p>‘or he touches some human uncleanness, whatever it may be, contact with which makes him unclean; he does not notice it, then, realising it later, he becomes answerable for it; </p>

<p>‘or someone lets slip an oath to do something either evil or good, in any of those matters on which someone may let slip an oath; he does not notice it, then, realising it later, he becomes answerable for it; </p>

<p>‘if he is answerable in any of those cases, he will have to confess the sin committed. As a sacrifice of reparation for the sin committed, he will bring Yahweh a female from the flock (sheep or goat) as a sacrifice for sin; and the priest will perform the rite of expiation for him to free him from his sin. </p>

<h4>Sins of private individuals (continued) (5:7–13)</h4>

<p>‘If he cannot afford an animal from the flock as a sacrifice of reparation for the sin he has committed, he will bring Yahweh two turtledoves or two young pigeons — one as a sacrifice for sin and the other as a burnt offering. He will bring them to the priest who will first offer the one intended for the sacrifice for sin. The priest will wring its neck but not remove the head. He will sprinkle the side of the altar with the victim’s blood, and then squeeze out the rest of the blood at the foot of the altar. This is a sacrifice for sin. He will then offer the other bird as a burnt offering according to the ritual. This is how the priest must perform the rite of expiation for the person for the sin he has committed, and he will be forgiven. </p>

<p>‘If he cannot afford two turtledoves or two young pigeons, he will bring a tenth of an ephah of wheaten flour as an offering for the sin committed; he must not mix oil with it or put incense on it, since this is a sacrifice for sin. He will bring it to the priest, who will take a handful of it as a memorial, and burn this on the altar in addition to the offerings of food burnt for Yahweh. This is a sacrifice for sin. This is how the priest must perform the rite of expiation for the person for the sin he has committed in any of those cases, and he will be forgiven. In this case, the priest has the same rights as in the case of a cereal offering’”. </p>

<h4>The sacrifice of reparation (5:14–26)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“If someone is unfaithful and sins inadvertently by infringing Yahweh’s sacred rights, as a sacrifice of reparation he must bring Yahweh an unblemished ram from his flock, the value of which will be decided by you in silver shekels according to the rate of the sanctuary-shekel. He will make amends for what his sin subtracted from the sacred rights, adding one-fifth to the value, and give it to the priest. The priest will then perform the rite of expiation for him with the ram for the sacrifice of reparation and he will be forgiven. </p>

<p>“If someone sins and without realising it does one of the things forbidden by Yahweh’s commandments, he will answer for it and bear the consequences of his guilt. As a sacrifice of reparation he must bring the priest an unblemished ram from his flock to the value which you decide, and the priest will perform the rite of expiation for him for the oversight unwittingly committed, and he will be forgiven. This is a sacrifice of reparation; the man was certainly answerable to Yahweh”. </p>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“If someone sins and is unfaithful against Yahweh by deceiving his fellow-countryman over a deposit or a security, or by withholding something due to him or by exploiting him; </p>

<p>“or if he finds lost property and denies it; </p>

<p>“or if he perjures himself about anything that a human being may do criminally in such matters; </p>

<p>“if he sins and so becomes answerable, he must restore what he has taken or demanded in excess: the deposit confided to him, the lost property that he has found, or any object about which he has perjured himself. He will add one-fifth to the principal and pay the whole to the person who held the property rights on the day when he incurred the guilt. He will then bring Yahweh an unblemished ram from his flock to the value which you decide, to the priest as a sacrifice of reparation, and the priest will perform the rite of expiation for him before Yahweh and he will be forgiven, whatever the act by which he incurred guilt”. </p>

<h4>Priesthood and sacrifice (6:1–7:6)</h4>

<h5>a: The burnt offering (6:1–6)</h5>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Give these orders to Aaron and his sons: </p>

<p>‘This is the ritual for the burnt offering (that is, the burnt offering that stays on the altar brazier all night until morning and is consumed by the altar fire). </p>

<p>‘The priest will put on his linen tunic and put his linen drawers on to cover himself. He will then remove the fatty ashes of the burnt offering consumed by the altar fire and put them at the side of the altar. He will then take off his clothes, put on others and carry the ashes to a clean place outside the camp. </p>

<p>‘The fire on the altar that consumes the burnt offering must not be allowed to go out. Every morning the priest will make it up with wood, arranging the burnt offering on it and burning the fat from the communion sacrifices. The fire must always be burning on the altar; it must never go out. </p>

<h5>b: The cereal offering (6:7–16)</h5>

<p>’This is the ritual for the cereal offering: </p>

<p>‘One of the descendants of Aaron will bring it into Yahweh’s 
presence in front of the altar, will take a handful of the wheaten flour (with the oil and all the incense which have been added to it) and burn the memorial on the altar as a smell pleasing to Yahweh; and Aaron and his sons will eat the remainder in the form of unleavened loaves. They will eat it inside the holy place, in the court of the Tent of Meeting. The portion I give them of the food burnt for me must not be baked with leaven; it is especially holy, like the sacrifice for sin and the sacrifice of reparation. All male descendants of Aaron are entitled to eat this portion of the food burnt for Yahweh (this is a perpetual law for all your descendants) and anyone who touches it will become holy’”. </p>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“This is the offering that Aaron and his sons must make to Yahweh on the day they are anointed: one-tenth of an ephah of wheaten flour as a perpetual cereal offering, half in the morning and half in the evening. It will be prepared on the griddle and mixed with oil; you will bring the paste as a cereal offering in several pieces, offering them as a smell pleasing to Yahweh. When one of his sons is anointed priest to succeed him, he will do the same. This is a perpetual law. </p>

<p>“The entire cereal offering will be burnt for Yahweh. Every cereal offering made by a priest will be a total sacrifice; none of it will be eaten”. </p>

<h5>c: The sacrifice for sin (6:17–22)</h5>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, “Speak to Aaron and his sons and say: </p>

<p>‘This is the ritual for the sacrifice for sin: </p>

<p>‘The victim must be slaughtered before Yahweh on the spot where the burnt offerings are slaughtered. It is especially holy. The priest who offers this sacrifice will eat it. It will be eaten inside the holy place, in the court of the Tent of Meeting. Everything touching the victim’s meat will become holy, and if any of the blood splashes on clothing, the stain will be washed off inside the holy place. The earthenware vessel in which the meat is cooked must be broken; if a bronze vessel has been used for the cooking, it must be scrubbed and thoroughly rinsed with water. Any male who is a priest may eat the sacrifice. It is especially holy. But no one may eat any of the victims offered for sin, the blood of which has been taken into the Tent of Meeting to make expiation inside the sanctuary. These must be burnt’”. </p>

<h5>d: The sacrifice of reparation (7:1–6)</h5>

<p>‘This is the ritual for the sacrifice of reparation: </p>

<p>‘It is especially holy. The victim must be slaughtered where the burnt offerings are slaughtered, and the priest will pour the blood all around the altar. He will then offer all the fat: the tail, the fat covering the entrails, both kidneys, the fat on them and on the loins, the mass of fat which he will remove from the liver and kidneys. The priest will burn these pieces on the altar as food burnt for Yahweh. This is a sacrifice of reparation. Every male who is a priest may eat it. It will be eaten inside the holy place; it is especially holy. </p>

<h4>The rights of the priests (7:7–10)</h4>

<p>‘As with the sacrifice for sin, so with the sacrifice of reparation — the ritual is the same for both. The offering with which the priest performs the rite of expiation will revert to the priest. The hide of the victim presented by someone to the priest to be offered as a burnt offering will revert to the priest. Every cereal offering baked in the oven, every cereal offering cooked in the pan or on the griddle will revert to the priest who offers it. Every cereal offering, mixed with oil or dry, will revert to all the descendants of Aaron without distinction. </p>

<h5>e: The communion sacrifice (7:11–17)</h5>

<h6>(i) Sacrifice with praise (7:11–15)</h6>

<p>‘This is the ritual for the communion sacrifice to be offered to Yahweh: </p>

<p>‘If this is offered as a sacrifice with praise, to the latter must be added an offering of unleavened cakes mixed with oil, unleavened wafers spread with oil, and wheaten flour in the form of cakes mixed with oil. This offering, then, must be added to the cakes of leavened bread and to the communion sacrifice with praise. One of the cakes of this offering must be presented as an offering to Yahweh; it will revert to the priest who pours out the blood of the communion sacrifice. The meat of the victim will be eaten on the day the offering is made; nothing may be left until next morning. </p>

<h6>(ii) Votive or voluntary sacrifice (7:16–17)</h6>

<p>‘If the victim is offered as a votive or a voluntary sacrifice, it must be eaten on the day it is offered, and the remainder may be eaten on the following day; but on the third day whatever is left of the meat of the victim must be burnt. </p>

<h4>General rules (7:18–27)</h4>

<p>‘If any of the meat of a victim offered as a communion sacrifice is eaten on the third day, the person who has offered it will not be acceptable and will receive no credit for it. It will count as rotten meat, and the person who eats it will bear the consequences of the guilt. </p>

<p>‘Meat that has touched anything unclean cannot be eaten; it must be burnt. </p>

<p>‘Anyone clean may eat the meat, but anyone unclean who eats the meat of a communion sacrifice offered to Yahweh will be outlawed from his people. Furthermore, if anyone touches anything unclean, human or animal, or any foul thing, and then eats the meat of a communion sacrifice offered to Yahweh, that individual will be outlawed from his people’”. </p>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, </p>

<p>“Speak to the Israelites and say: </p>

<p>‘You may not eat the fat of ox, sheep or goat. The fat of an animal that has died a natural death or been savaged by beasts may be used for any other purpose, but you are not to eat it. Anyone who eats the fat of an animal offered as food burnt for Yahweh will be outlawed from his people. </p>

<p>‘Wherever you live, you will never eat blood, whether it be of bird or of beast. Anyone who eats any blood will be outlawed from his people’”. </p>

<h4>The priest’s portion (7:28–34)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, </p>

<p>“Speak to the Israelites and say: </p>

<p>‘Anyone who offers Yahweh a communion sacrifice must bring him part of his sacrifice as an offering. He must bring the food to be burnt for Yahweh, that is to say, the fat adhering to the forequarters, with his own hands. He will bring it, and also the forequarters, with which he will make the gesture of offering before Yahweh. The priest will then burn the fat on the altar, and the forequarters will revert to Aaron and his descendants. You will set aside the right thigh from your communion sacrifice and give it to the priest. The right thigh will be the portion of the descendant of Aaron who offers the blood and fat of the communion sacrifice. For I have deprived the Israelites of the forequarter offered and the thigh presented in their communion sacrifices, and given them to the priest Aaron and his descendants; this is a perpetual law for the Israelites’”. </p>

<h4>Conclusion (7:35–38)</h4>

<p>Such was the portion of Aaron and his descendants in the food burnt for Yahweh, the day he presented them to Yahweh for them to become his priests. This was what Yahweh ordered the Israelites to give them on the day they were anointed: a perpetual law for all their descendants. </p>

<p>Such was the ritual for burnt offering, cereal offering, sacrifice for sin, sacrifice of reparation, investiture sacrifice and communion sacrifice, which Yahweh laid down for Moses on Mount Sinai, the day he ordered the Israelites to make their offerings to Yahweh in the desert of Sinai. </p>

<h2 id="ii">II: The Investiture of the Priests (8:1–10:20)</h2>

<h4>Consecration rites (8:1–36)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Take Aaron and with him his sons, the vestments, the anointing oil, the bull for the sacrifice for sin, the two rams and the basket of unleavened bread. Then call the whole community together at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting”. </p>

<p>Moses did as Yahweh ordered; the community gathered at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, and Moses said to them, “This is what Yahweh has ordered to be done”. </p>

<p>He made Aaron and his sons come forward and washed them with water. </p>

<p>He then dressed him in the tunic, passed the waistband round his waist, vested him in the robe and put the ephod on him. He then put the waistband of the ephod round his waist, fastening it to him. He put the breastplate on him, and placed the urim and thummim in it. He put the turban on his head, and on the front of the turban, the golden flower; this was the symbol of holy consecration, which Yahweh had prescribed to Moses. </p>

<p>Moses then took the anointing oil and anointed the Dwelling and everything inside it, to consecrate them. He sprinkled the altar seven times and anointed the altar and its accessories, the basin and its stand, to consecrate them. He then poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him to consecrate him. </p>

<p>Moses then made Aaron’s sons come forward; he dressed them in tunics, passed the waistbands round their waists and put on their head-dresses, as Yahweh had ordered him. </p>

<p>He then had the bull for the sacrifice for sin brought forward. Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the victim’s head and Moses slaughtered it. He then took the blood and with his finger put some of it on the horns on the corners of the altar to purify the altar. He then poured the rest of the blood at the foot of the altar, which he consecrated by performing the rite of expiation over it. He then took all the fat covering the entrails, the mass of fat over the liver, both kidneys and their fat; and he burnt this on the altar, but the bull’s skin, its meat and its offal he burnt outside the camp, as Yahweh had ordered Moses. </p>

<p>He then had the ram for the burnt offering brought forward. Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the ram’s head and Moses slaughtered it. He poured its blood all around the altar. He then quartered the ram and burned the head, the quarters and the fat. He then washed the entrails and shins, and burnt the whole ram on the altar, as a burnt offering, offered to be a pleasing smell, as food burnt for Yahweh, as Yahweh had ordered Moses. </p>

<p>He then had the other ram brought forward, the ram for the investiture sacrifice. Aaron and his sons laid their hands on its head and Moses slaughtered it. He took some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron’s right ear, on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot. He then made Aaron’s sons come forward and he put some of the blood on the lobes of their right ears, on the thumbs of their right hands and on the big toes of their right feet. Next, Moses poured the rest of the blood all around the altar. He then took the fat: the tail, all the fat covering the entrails, the mass of fat over the liver, both kidneys and their fat, and the right thigh. From the basket of unleavened bread placed before Yahweh, he took an unleavened cake, a cake of bread made with oil, and a wafer; he placed these on the fat and the right thigh, and put it all into Aaron’s hands and those of his sons, and made the gesture of offering before Yahweh. Moses then took them away from them and burned them on the altar, with the burnt offering. This was the investiture sacrifice, offered to be a pleasing smell, as food burnt for Yahweh. Moses then took the forequarter and made the gesture of offering before Yahweh. This was the portion of the ram of investiture that reverted to Moses, as Yahweh had ordered Moses. </p>

<p>Moses then took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood that was on the altar and sprinkled Aaron and his vestments, and his sons and their vestments, with it. In this way he consecrated Aaron and his vestments and his sons and their vestments. </p>

<p>Moses then said to Aaron and his sons, “Cook the meat at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, and eat it there, as also the bread of the investiture sacrifice still in the basket of the investiture offerings, as I ordered, when I said, ‘Aaron and his sons must eat it’. What remains of the meat and bread you will burn. For seven days you will not leave the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, until the time of your investiture is complete; for your investiture will require seven days. Yahweh has ordered us to do as we have done today to perform the rite of expiation for you; hence, for seven days, day and night, you will remain at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting observing Yahweh’s ritual; do this, and you will not incur death. For this was the order I received”. So Aaron and his sons did everything that Yahweh had ordered through Moses. </p>

<h4>The priests assume their functions (9:1–24)</h4>

<p>On the eighth day Moses summoned Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel; he said to Aaron, “Take a calf to offer a sacrifice for sin, and a ram for a burnt offering, both without blemish, and bring them before Yahweh. Then say to the Israelites, ‘Take a goat to be offered as a sacrifice for sin, a calf and a lamb one year old (both without blemish) for a burnt offering, a bull and a ram for communion sacrifices to be slaughtered before Yahweh, and a cereal offering mixed with oil. For Yahweh will appear to you today’”. </p>

<p>They brought what Moses had ordered in front of the Tent of Meeting; then the whole community approached and stood before Yahweh. Moses then said, “This is what Yahweh has ordered you to do, so that his glory may be visible to you”. Moses then addressed Aaron, “Go to the altar and offer your sacrifice for sin and your burnt offering, and so perform the rite of expiation for yourself and your family. Then present the people’s offering and perform the rite of expiation for them, as Yahweh has ordered”. </p>

<p>Aaron went to the altar and slaughtered the calf as a sacrifice for his own sin. Aaron’s sons then presented the blood to him; he dipped his finger in it and put some on the horns of the altar, and then poured the rest of the blood at the foot of the altar. The fat of the sacrifice for sin and the kidneys and the mass of fat over the liver he burned on the altar, as Yahweh had ordered Moses, and the meat and the skin he burned outside the camp. </p>

<p>He then slaughtered the burnt offering; Aaron’s sons then handed him the blood, which he poured all around the altar. They then handed him the quartered victim and the head, and he burned these on the altar. He then washed the entrails and shins and burned them with the burnt offering on the altar. </p>

<p>He then presented the people’s offering. He took the goat for the people’s sacrifice for sin, slaughtered it, and made a sacrifice for sin with it in the same way as with the first. He then had the burnt offering brought forward and proceeded according to the ritual. He then had the cereal offering brought forward, took a handful of it and burned it on the altar in addition to the morning burnt offering. Then he slaughtered the bull and the ram as a communion sacrifice for the people. Aaron’s sons handed him the blood and he poured it all around the altar. The fat of the bull and the ram, the tail, the covering fat, the kidneys, the mass of fat over the liver, he placed on the ribs and then burned on the altar. With the ribs and the right thigh Aaron made the gesture of offering as Yahweh had ordered Moses. </p>

<p>Aaron then raised his hands towards the people and blessed them. Having thus performed the sacrifice for sin, the burnt offering and the communion sacrifice, he came down and entered the Tent of Meeting with Moses. Then they came out together to bless the people and the glory of Yahweh appeared to the entire people: a flame leapt out from Yahweh’s presence and consumed the burnt offering and fat on the altar. At this sight the entire people shouted for joy and fell on their faces. </p>

<h4>Complementary legislation (10:1–20)</h4>

<h5>a: A lesson in exact observance (10:1–3)</h5>

<p>Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu each took his censer, put fire in it and incense on the fire, and presented unauthorised fire before Yahweh, which was not in accordance with his orders. At this a flame leapt out from Yahweh’s presence and swallowed them up, and they perished before Yahweh. Moses then said to Aaron, “That is what Yahweh meant when he said: </p>

<blockquote>In those who are close to me I show my holiness, <br />
and before all the people I show my glory.</blockquote>

<p> Aaron remained silent. </p>

<h5>b: Removal of bodies (10:4–5)</h5>

<p>Moses summoned Mishael and Elzaphan, sons of Aaron’s uncle Uzziel, and said to them, “Come here and take your brothers away from the sanctuary, out of the camp”. They came and carried them away, still in their tunics, out of the camp, as Moses had said. </p>

<h5>c: Rules for priestly mourning (10:6–7)</h5>

<p>Moses said to Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, “Do not disorder your hair or tear your clothes; or you may incur death and his retribution may overtake the whole community. No, it is for the entire House of Israel to lament your brothers who have been the victims of Yahweh’s fire. To avoid incurring death, do not leave the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, for Yahweh’s anointing oil is on you”. And they did as Moses said. </p>

<h5>d: Wine forbidden (10:8–11)</h5>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Aaron and said: </p>

<p>“When you come to the Tent of Meeting, you and your sons with you, to avoid incurring death you may not drink wine or any other fermented liquor. This is a perpetual law for all your descendants. And so shall it be also when you separate the sacred from the profane, the unclean from the clean, and when you teach the Israelites any of the decrees that Yahweh has pronounced for them through Moses”. </p>

<h5>e: The priests’ portion in offerings (10:12–15)</h5>

<p>Moses said to Aaron and his surviving sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, “Take the cereal offering left over from the food burnt for Yahweh. Eat the unleavened part of it beside the altar, since it is especially holy. Eat it in the holy place, since it is the portion of the food burnt for Yahweh that is prescribed for you and your sons; this is the order I have received. </p>

<p>“You, your sons and daughters with you, will eat in a clean place the forequarter offered and the thigh presented, for these have been given to you and your children as your due from the Israelites’ communion sacrifices. The thigh presented and the forequarter offered, once the fat has been burnt, revert to you and your sons with you, after they have been presented before Yahweh with the gesture of offering, in virtue of a perpetual law as Yahweh has ordered”. </p>

<h5>f: A special regulation concerning sacrifice for sin (10:16–20)</h5>

<p>Moses then enquired carefully about the goat offered as a sacrifice for sin, and found that they had burnt it. He was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron’s surviving sons, and said, “Why did you not eat this victim for sin in the holy place, since it is especially holy and was given to you to take away the community’s guilt, by performing the rite of expiation for them before Yahweh? Since its blood was not taken inside the sanctuary, you should have eaten its meat there, as I ordered you”. </p>

<p>Aaron said to Moses, “Look, today they offered their sacrifice for sin and their burnt offering before Yahweh, and these disasters have befallen me. If I had eaten the sin offering today, would this have met with Yahweh’s approval?”. And when Moses heard this, he was satisfied. </p>

<h2 id="iii">III: Rules Concerning the Clean and Unclean (11:1–16:34)</h2>

<h4>Clean and unclean animals (11:1–23)</h4>

<h5>a: On land (11:1–8)</h5>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron and said to them, “Speak to the Israelites and say: </p>

<p>‘Of all animals living on land these are the creatures you may eat: </p>

<p>‘You may eat any animal that has a cloven hoof, divided into two parts, and that is a ruminant. The following, which either chew the cud or have a cloven hoof, are the ones that you may not eat: you will regard the camel as unclean, because though it is ruminant, it does not have a cloven hoof; you will regard the coney as unclean, because though it is ruminant, it does not have a cloven hoof; you will regard the hare as unclean, because though it is ruminant, it does not have a cloven hoof; you will regard the pig as unclean, because though it has a cloven hoof, divided into two parts, it is not a ruminant. You will not eat the meat of these or touch their dead bodies; you will regard them as unclean. </p>

<h5>b: In water (11:9–12)</h5>

<p>‘Of all that lives in water, these you may eat: </p>

<p>‘Anything that has fins and scales, and lives in the water, whether in sea or river, you may eat. But anything in sea or river that does not have fins and scales, of all the small water-creatures and all the living things found there, you will regard as detestable. You will regard them as detestable; you must not eat their meat and you will regard their carcases as detestable. Anything that lives in water, but not having fins and scales, you will regard as detestable. </p>

<h5>c: Birds (11:13–19)</h5>

<p>‘Of the birds these are the ones that you will regard as detestable; they may not be eaten, they are detestable for eating: </p>

<p>‘The tawny vulture, the griffon, the osprey, the kite, the various kinds of buzzard, all kinds of raven, the ostrich, the screech owl, the seagull, the various kinds of hawk, horned owl, night owl, cormorant, barn owl, ibis, pelican, white vulture, stork, the various kinds of heron, the hoopoe and the bat. </p>

<h5>d: Winged insects (11:20–23)</h5>

<p>‘All winged insects moving on four feet you will regard as detestable for eating. Of all these winged insects you may eat only the following: those with the sort of legs above their feet which enable them to leap over the ground. These are the ones you may eat: the various kinds of migratory locust, the various kinds of <i>solham</i> locust, <i>hargol</i> locust and <i>hagab</i> locust. But all other winged insects on four feet you will regard as detestable for eating. </p>

<h4>Contact with unclean animals (11:24–30)</h4>

<p>‘By the following you will be made unclean. Anyone who touches the carcase of one will be unclean until evening. Anyone who picks up their carcases must wash his clothing and will be unclean until evening. Animals that have hoofs, but not cloven, and that are not ruminant, you will regard as unclean; anyone who touches them will be unclean. Those four-footed animals which walk on the flat of their paws you will regard as unclean; anyone who touches their carcases will be unclean until evening, and anyone who picks up their carcases must wash his clothing and will be unclean until evening. You will regard them as unclean. </p>

<h5>e: Small ground animals (11:29–30)</h5>

<p>‘Of the small creatures which crawl along the ground, these are the ones which you will regard as unclean: the mole, the rat, the various kinds of lizard: gecko, <i>koah</i>, <i>letaah</i>, chameleon and <i>tinshamet</i>. </p>

<h4>Further rules on contact with things unclean (11:31–40)</h4>

<p>‘Of all the small creatures, these are the animals which you must regard as disgusting. Anyone who touches them when they are dead will be unclean until evening. </p>

<p>‘Any object on which one of these creatures falls when it is dead becomes unclean: wooden utensil, clothing, skin, sacking, any utensil whatever. It must be immersed in water and will remain unclean until evening: then it will be clean. If the creature falls into an earthenware vessel, the vessel must be broken; whatever the vessel contains is unclean. Any edible food will be unclean if the water touches it; any drinkable liquid will be unclean, no matter what its container. Anything on which the carcase of such a creature may fall will be unclean: be it oven or stove, it must be destroyed; for they are unclean and you will regard them as unclean (although springs, wells and stretches of water will remain clean); anyone who touches one of their 
carcases will be unclean. If one of their carcases falls on any kind of seed, the seed will remain clean; but if the seed has been moistened and one of their carcases falls on it, you will regard it as unclean. </p>

<p>‘If one of the animals that you use as food dies, anyone who touches the carcase will be unclean until evening; anyone who eats any of the carcase must wash his clothing and will remain unclean until evening; anyone who picks up the carcase must wash his clothing and will remain unclean until evening. </p>

<h4>The religious aspect (11:41–45)</h4>

<p>‘Any creature that swarms on the ground is detestable for eating; it must not be eaten. Anything that moves on its belly, anything that moves on four legs or more — in short all the creatures that swarm on the ground — you will not eat, since they are detestable. Do not make yourselves detestable with all these swarming creatures; do not defile yourselves with them, do not be defiled by them. For it is I, Yahweh, who am your God. You have been sanctified and have become holy because I am holy: do not defile yourselves with all these creatures that swarm on the ground. Yes, it is I, Yahweh, who brought you out of Egypt to be your God: you must therefore be holy 
because I am holy’”. </p>

<h4>Conclusion (11:46–47)</h4>

<p>Such is the law concerning animals, birds, all living creatures that move in water and all creatures that swarm on the ground. Its purpose is to distinguish the clean from the unclean, the creatures that may be eaten from those that may not be eaten. </p>

<h4>Purification of a woman after childbirth (12:1–8)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said, “Speak to the Israelites and say: </p>

<p>‘If a woman becomes pregnant and gives birth to a boy, she will be unclean for seven days as when in a state of pollution due to menstruation. On the eighth day the child’s foreskin must be circumcised, and she will wait another thirty-three days for her blood to be purified. She will not touch anything consecrated nor go to the sanctuary until the time of her purification is over. </p>

<p>‘If she gives birth to a girl, she will be unclean for two weeks, as during her monthly periods; and will wait another sixty-six days for her blood to be purified. </p>

<p>‘When the period of her purification is over, for either boy or girl, she will bring the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting a lamb one year old for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon or turtledove as a sacrifice for sin. The priest must offer this before Yahweh, perform the rite of expiation for her, and she will be purified from her discharge of blood. </p>

<p>‘Such is the law concerning a woman who gives birth to either a boy or a girl. If she cannot afford a lamb, she must take two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for the burnt offering and the other for the sacrifice for sin. The priest will perform the rite of expiation for her and she will be purified’”. </p>

<h4>Human skin-diseases (13:1–44)</h4>

<h5>a: Swellings, scabs, discolourations </h5>

<p>Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, “If a swelling or scab or spot appears on someone’s skin, which could develop into a contagious skin-disease, that person must then be taken to the priest, either Aaron or one of his sons. The priest will examine the disease on the skin. If the hair on the diseased part has turned white, or if the disease bites into the skin, the skin-disease is contagious, and after examination the priest will declare the person unclean. But if there is a white spot on the skin without any visible depression of the skin or whitening of the hair, the priest will isolate the sick person for seven days. On the seventh day he will examine the person, and if he observes that the disease persists though without spreading over the skin, he will isolate the person for a further seven days and examine him again on the seventh. If he finds that the disease has faded and has not spread over the skin, the priest will declare the person clean. This was merely a scab. Once he has washed his clothing he will be clean. </p>

<p>“But if the scab spreads over the skin after the sick person has been examined by the priest and declared clean, then he will let himself be examined again by the priest. After examining him and certifying the spread of the scab over the skin, the priest will declare him unclean: it is a contagious skin-disease. </p>

<h5>b: Cases of dormant skin-disease (13:9–17)</h5>

<p>“Someone who has a contagious skin-disease must be taken to the priest. The priest will examine the sick person, and if he finds a whitish swelling with whitening of the hair and an ulcer forming on the skin, this is a dormant skin-disease, and the priest will declare the person unclean. He will not isolate him; he is obviously unclean. </p>

<p>“But if the disease spreads all through the skin, if it covers the person entirely from head to foot so far as the priest can see, the priest will then examine the sick person and, if he finds that the skin-disease covers his whole body, declare the sick person clean. Since it has all become white, he is clean. But as soon as an ulcer appears on him, he will be unclean. After examining the ulcer, the priest will declare him unclean: the ulcer is unclean, it is contagious. But if the ulcer becomes white again, the sick person will go to the priest; the priest will examine him and if he finds that the disease has turned white, he will declare the sick person clean: he is clean. </p>

<h5>c: Ulcers (13:18–23)</h5>

<p>“When an ulcer appears on someone’s skin, and then gets better, and if then a white swelling or a reddish-white spot forms on the same place, the sick person will show himself to the priest. The priest will examine him, and if he finds a visible depression in the skin and a whitening of the hair, he will declare the person unclean: this is a case of contagious skin-disease breaking out in an ulcer. But if on examination the priest finds neither white hair nor depression of the skin, but a fading of the affected part, he will isolate the sick person for seven days. If the disease has then spread over the skin, he will declare the person unclean: this is a case of contagious skin-disease. But if the spot has stayed where it was and has not spread, it is the scar of the ulcer and the priest will declare the person clean. </p>

<h5>d: Burns (13:24–28)</h5>

<p>“If someone has a burn on the skin and an abscess, a reddish-white or white spot, forms on the burn, the priest will then examine it. If he finds a whitening of the hair or a visible depression of the mark on the skin, a contagious disease has broken out in the burn. The priest will declare the sick person unclean: this is a contagious skin-disease. If on the other hand the priest on examination does not find white hair on the mark or depression of the skin, but a fading of the mark, the priest will isolate the person for seven days. He will examine the person on the seventh day and, if the disease has spread over the skin, he will declare the sick person unclean: this is a case of contagious skin-disease. If the mark has stayed where it was and has not spread over the skin, but has faded instead, it was only a swelling due to the burn. The priest will declare the person clean: it is merely a burn scar. </p>

<h5>e: Diseases of the scalp and chin (13:29–37)</h5>

<p>“If a man or a woman has a sore on the head or chin, the priest will examine the sore; and if he finds a depression visible in the skin, with the hair on it yellow and thin, he will declare the sick person unclean: this is tinea, that is to say, a contagious skin-disease of the head or chin. If on examining this case of tinea the priest finds no visible depression in the skin and no yellow hair, he will isolate the person so affected for seven days. He will examine the infected part on the seventh day, and if he finds that the tinea has not spread, that the hair on it is not yellow, and that there is no visible depression in the skin, the sick person will shave his hair off, all except the part affected with tinea, and the priest will again isolate him for seven days. He will examine the infected part on the seventh day, and if he finds that it has not spread over the skin, and that there is no visible depression of the skin, the priest will declare the sick person clean. After washing his clothes the person will be clean. But if after this purification the tinea does spread over the skin, the priest will examine the person; if he finds that the tinea has indeed spread over the skin, the sick person is unclean, and there is no need to verify whether the hair is yellow. Whereäs if, so far as he can see, the tinea is arrested and dark hair is beginning to grow on it, the sick person is cured. He is clean, and the priest will declare him clean. </p>

<h5>f: Rash (13:38–39)</h5>

<p>“If spots break out on the skin of a man or woman, and if these spots are white, the priest will examine them. If he finds that the spots are of a dull white, this is a rash that has broken out on the skin: the sick person is clean. </p>

<h5>g: Loss of hair (13:40–44)</h5>

<p>“If someone loses the hair of the scalp, this is baldness of the scalp but the person is clean. If he loses hair off the front of the head, this is baldness of the forehead but the person is clean. If, however, a reddish-white sore appears on scalp or forehead, a contagious skin-disease has broken out on the scalp or forehead. The priest will examine it, and if he finds a reddish-white swelling on scalp or forehead, looking like a contagious skin-disease, the person has such a disease: he is unclean. The priest will declare him unclean; he has a contagious skin-disease of the head. </p>

<h4>The law governing cases of contagious skin-diseases (13:45–46)</h4>

<p>“Anyone with a contagious skin-disease will wear torn clothing and disordered hair; and will cover the upper lip and shout, ‘Unclean, unclean’. As long as the disease lasts, such a person will be unclean and, being unclean, will live alone and live outside the camp. </p>

<h4>Infections of clothing (13:44–59)</h4>

<p>“When a piece of clothing is infected with mould, be it woollen or linen clothing, linen or woollen fabric or covering, or leather or anything made of leather, if the spot on the clothing, leather, fabric, covering or object made of leather is a greenish or reddish colour, it is a disease to be shown to the priest. The priest will examine the infection and isolate the object for seven days. If on the seventh day he observes that the infection has spread on the clothing, fabric, covering, leather or object made of leather, whatever it may be, this is a contagious disease and the object is unclean. He will burn this clothing, fabric, linen or woollen covering or leather object whatever it may be, on which the infection has appeared; for this is a contagious disease which must be destroyed by fire. </p>

<p>“But if on examination the priest finds that the infection has not spread on the clothing, fabric, covering, or leather object whatever it may be, he will order the infected object to be washed and will isolate it again for a period of seven days. After the washing, he will examine the infection and if he finds that there is no change in its appearance, even though it has not spread, the article is unclean. You will burn it; it is infected through and through. </p>

<p>“But if on examination the priest finds that the infection has diminished after washing, he will tear it out of the clothing, leather, fabric or covering. But if the infection reappears on the same clothing, fabric, covering or leather object whatever it may be, this means that the infection is active; you will burn whatever is infected. The clothing, fabric, covering or leather object whatever it may be, from which the infection disappears after being washed, will be clean after it has been washed a second time. </p>

<p>“Such is the law governing disease in a linen or woollen garment, a fabric or covering or leather object whatever it may be, when it is a question of declaring them clean or unclean”. </p>

<h4>Purification from contagious skin-diseases (14:1–32)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: “This is the law to be applied on the day of the purification of someone who has suffered from a contagious skin-disease. Such a person will be taken to the priest, and the priest will go outside the camp. If he finds on examination that the person has recovered from the disease, he will order the following to be brought for his purification: two live birds that are clean, some cedar wood, scarlet material and hyssop. He will then order one of the birds to be slaughtered in an earthenware pot over running water. He will then take the live bird, the cedar wood, the scarlet material and the hyssop and dip all this (including the live bird) into the blood of the bird slaughtered over running water. He will then sprinkle the person to be purified of the skin-disease seven times, and having declared the person clean, will set the live bird free to fly off into the countryside. The person who is being purified will then wash all clothing, shave off all hair, and wash, and will then be clean. After this he will return to the camp, although he will remain outside his tent for seven days. On the seventh day he will shave off all his hair-head, beard and eyebrows; he will shave off all his hair. After washing his clothing and his body he will be clean. </p>

<p>“On the eighth day he will take two unblemished lambs, an unblemished ewe one year old, three-tenths of wheaten flour mixed with oil for the cereal offering, and one log of oil. The priest who is performing the purification will place the person who is being purified, with all his offerings, at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, before Yahweh. He will then take one of the lambs and offer it as a sacrifice of reparation, as also the log of oil. With these he will make the gesture of offering before Yahweh. He will then slaughter the lamb on that spot inside the holy place where the victims for the sacrifice for sin and for the burnt offering are slaughtered. This reparatory offering, like the sacrifice for sin, will revert to the priest: it is especially holy. The priest will then take some blood of this sacrifice and put it on the lobe of the right ear, the thumb of the right hand, and the big toe of the right foot of the person who is being purified. He will then take the log of oil and pour a little into the hollow of his left hand. He will dip a finger of his right hand into the oil in the hollow of his left hand, and sprinkle the oil with his finger seven times before Yahweh. He will then take some of the oil left in the hollow of his hand and put it on the lobe of the right ear, the thumb of the right hand, and the big toe of the right foot of the person being purified, in addition to the blood of the sacrifice of reparation. The rest of the oil in the hollow of his hand he will put on the head of the person who is being purified. This is how the priest will perform the rite of expiation for such a person before Yahweh. </p>

<p>The priest will then offer the sacrifice for sin, and perform the rite of expiation for uncleanness for the person who is being purified. After this, he will slaughter the burnt offering and offer this and the cereal offering on the altar. So, when the priest has performed the rite of expiation for him the person will be clean. </p>

<p>“If he is poor and cannot afford all this, he need take only one lamb, the one for the sacrifice of reparation, and this will be presented with the gesture of offering to perform the rite of expiation for him. And for the cereal offering he will only take one-tenth of wheaten flour mixed with oil, and the log of oil, and two turtledoves or two young pigeons, whichever he can afford, one for a sacrifice for sin and the other for the burnt offering. He will bring these on the eighth day to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting before Yahweh, for his purification. The priest will take the lamb for the sacrifice of reparation and the log of oil, and present them before Yahweh with the gesture of offering. He will then slaughter the lamb for the sacrifice of reparation, take some of its blood and put it on the lobe of the right ear, the thumb of the right hand and the big toe of the right foot of the person who is being purified. He will pour the oil into the hollow of his left hand, and with his finger sprinkle the oil in the hollow of his left hand seven times before Yahweh. He will then put some of the oil on the lobe of the right ear, the thumb of the right hand and the big toe of the right foot of the person who is being purified, as he did with the blood of the sacrifice of reparation. The remainder of the oil in the hollow of his hand he will put on the head of the person who is being purified, thus performing the rite of expiation for him before Yahweh.  Of the two turtledoves or two young pigeons — whatever he has been able to afford — he will offer a sacrifice for sin with one, and with the other a burnt offering with a cereal offering — whatever he has been able to afford. This is how the priest will perform before Yahweh the rite of expiation for the person who is being purified. </p>

<p>“Such is the law concerning someone with a contagious skin-disease who cannot afford the means of purification”. </p>

<h4>Similar infections of houses (14:33–57)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron and said: </p>

<p>“When you reach Canaan, which I am giving you as your possession, if I infect a house with a disease in the country which you are to possess, the owner will come and inform the priest and say, ‘I have seen something like a skin-disease in the house’. The priest will order the house to be emptied before he goes to examine the infection, or everything in the house will become unclean; after which, the priest will go inside and examine the house; and if on examination he finds the walls of the house pitted with reddish or greenish depressions which appear to be eating away the wall, the priest will then go out of the house, to the door, and shut it up for seven days. On the seventh day, the priest will come back and if on examination he finds that the infection has spread over the walls of the house, he will order the infected stones to be removed and thrown into some unclean place outside the town. He will then have all the inside of the house scraped, and the plaster that comes off will be emptied in an unclean place outside the town. The stones will then be replaced with new ones and the house given a new coat of plaster. </p>

<p>“If the infection spreads again after the stones have been removed and the house scraped and replastered, the priest will come and examine it. If he finds that the infection has spread, this means that there is a contagious disease in the house: it is unclean. It must be pulled down and the stones, woodwork and all the plaster be taken to an unclean place outside the town. </p>

<p>“Anyone who enters the house while it is closed will be unclean until evening. Anyone who sleeps there will wash his clothes. Anyone who eats there will wash his clothes. But if the priest finds, when he comes to examine the infection, that it has not spread in the house since it was plastered, he will declare the house clean, for the infection is cured. </p>

<p>“As a sacrifice for the defilement of the house, he will take two birds, some cedar wood, scarlet material and hyssop. He will slaughter one of the birds in an earthenware pot over running water. He will then take the cedar wood, the hyssop, the scarlet material and the live bird, dip them into the blood of the slaughtered bird and into the running water and sprinkle the house seven times; and after offering the sacrifice for the defilement of the house with the blood of the bird, the running water, the live bird, the cedar wood, the hyssop and the scarlet material, he will set the live bird free to fly out of the town into the countryside. Once the rite of expiation has been performed for the house in this way it will be clean. </p>

<p>“Such is the law governing all kinds of skin-disease and tinea, diseases of clothing and houses, swellings, scabs and spots. It defines the occasions when things are unclean and when clean. Such is the law on skin-diseases”. </p>

<h4>Sexual impurities (15:1–30)</h4>

<h5>a: Of men (15:1–18)</h5>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron and said: </p>

<p>“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: </p>

<p>‘When a man has a discharge from his body, that discharge is unclean. While the discharge continues, the nature of his uncleanness is as follows: </p>

<p>‘Whether his body allows the discharge to flow or whether it retains it, he is unclean. </p>

<p>‘Any bed the man lies on and anything he sits on will be unclean. </p>

<p>‘Anyone who touches his bed must wash clothing and body and will be unclean until evening. </p>

<p>‘Anyone who sits where the man has sat must wash clothing and body and will be unclean until evening. </p>

<p>‘Anyone who touches the body of the man with the discharge must wash clothing and body and will be unclean until evening. </p>

<p>‘If the man with the discharge spits on someone who is clean, that person must wash clothing and body and will be unclean until evening. </p>

<p>‘Any saddle the man has ridden on will be unclean. </p>

<p>‘All those who touch any object that has been under him will be unclean until evening. </p>

<p>‘Anyone who picks up such an object must wash clothing and body and will be unclean until evening. </p>

<p>‘All those whom the man with the discharge touches without having washed his hands must wash clothing and body and will be unclean until evening. </p>

<p>‘The earthenware vessel he touches must be broken and any wooden utensil must be rinsed. </p>

<p>‘Once the man with the discharge is cured, he will allow seven days for his purification. He will wash his clothes and wash his body in running water and he will be clean. On the eighth day he will take two turtledoves or two young pigeons and come before Yahweh at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and give them to the priest. The priest will offer one of them as a sacrifice for sin and the other as a burnt offering. And in this way the priest will perform the rite of expiation for him before Yahweh for his discharge. </p>

<p>‘When a man has a seminal discharge, he must wash his whole body with water and will be unclean until evening. Any clothing or leather touched by the seminal discharge must be washed and will be unclean until evening. When a woman has had intercourse with a man, both of them must wash and will be unclean until evening. </p>

<h5>b: Of women (15:19–30)</h5>

<p>‘Whenever a woman has a discharge and the discharge from her body is of blood, she will remain in a state of menstrual pollution for seven days. </p>

<p>‘Anyone who touches her will be unclean until evening. </p>

<p>‘Anything she lies on in this polluted state will be unclean; anything she sits on will be unclean. </p>

<p>‘Anyone who touches her bed must wash clothing and body and will be unclean until evening. </p>

<p>‘Anyone who touches anything she has sat on must wash clothing and body and will be unclean until evening. If there is anything on the bed or where she is sitting, anyone who touches it will be unclean until evening. </p>

<p>‘If a man goes so far as to sleep with her, he will contract her menstrual pollution and will be unclean for seven days. Any bed he lies on will be unclean. </p>

<p>‘If a woman has a prolonged discharge of blood outside the period, or if the period is prolonged, during the time this discharge lasts she will be in the same state of uncleanness as during her monthly periods. Any bed she lies on during the time this discharge lasts will be polluted in the same way as the bed she lies on during her monthly periods. Anything she sits on will be unclean as during her monthly periods. Anyone who touches it will be unclean and must wash clothing and body and will be unclean until evening. </p>

<p>‘Once she is cured of her discharge, she will allow seven days to go by; after that she will be clean. On the eighth day she will take two turtledoves or two young pigeons and bring them to the priest at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. The priest will offer one of them as a sacrifice for sin and the other as a burnt offering. And in this way the priest will perform the rite of expiation for her before Yahweh for the discharge which made her unclean. </p>

<h4>Conclusion (15:31–33)</h4>

<p>‘Hence you will warn the Israelites against contracting a state of uncleanness, rather than incurring death by defiling my Dwelling which is among them. </p>

<p>‘Such is the law governing a man with a discharge or who is made unclean by a seminal discharge, a woman in a state of pollution due to menstruation, a man or a woman with a discharge, or a man who sleeps with a woman when she is unclean’”. </p>

<h4>The great day of expiation (16:1–34)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron who died when offering unauthorised fire. Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Tell Aaron your brother that he may not enter the sanctuary inside the curtain in front of the mercy-seat on the ark whenever he chooses, in case he incurs death, for I appear in a cloud on the mercy-seat. </p>

<p>“This is how he must enter the sanctuary: with a young bull for a sacrifice for sin and a ram for a burnt offering. He will put on a tunic of consecrated linen, wear linen drawers on his body, a linen waistband round his waist, and a linen turban on his head. These are the sacred vestments he will put on after washing himself. </p>

<p>“From the community of Israelites he will receive two he-goats for a sacrifice for sin and a ram for a burnt offering. After offering the bull as a sacrifice for his own sin and performing the rite of expiation for himself and his family, he will take the two he-goats and place them before Yahweh at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. Aaron will then draw lots over the two goats, one lot to be for Yahweh and the other lot for Azazel. Aaron will then take the goat on which the lot ‘For Yahweh’ has fallen, and offer it as a sacrifice for sin. But the goat on which the lot ‘For Azazel’ has fallen, will be placed alive before Yahweh, for the rite of expiation to be performed with it, and for it then to be sent to Azazel in the desert. </p>

<p>“Having offered the bull as a sacrifice for his own sin and performed the rite of expiation for himself and for his family, and slaughtered the bull as a sacrifice for sin, Aaron will then fill a censer with live coals from the altar before Yahweh, take two handfuls of finely ground aromatic incense and bring this inside the curtain. He will then put the incense on the fire before Yahweh, so that the cloud of incense hides the mercy-seat which is on the Testimony and he does not incur death. He will then take some of the bull’s blood and sprinkle it with his finger on the eastern side of the mercy-seat. He will sprinkle some of the blood seven times with his finger in front of the mercy-seat. </p>

<p>“He will then slaughter the goat for the sacrifice for the sin of the people, and take its blood inside the curtain, and with this blood do as he did with the blood of the bull, sprinkling it on the mercy-seat and in front of it. This is how he must perform the rite of expiation for the sanctuary for the uncleanness of the Israelites, for their acts of rebellion and all their sins. </p>

<p>“And this is what he must do for the Tent of Meeting which remains with them, surrounded by their uncleanness. No one must be inside the Tent of Meeting, from the moment he enters to make expiation in the sanctuary until the time he comes out. </p>

<p>“When he has made expiation for himself, for his family, and for the whole 
community of Israel, he must come outside, go to the altar before Yahweh and perform the rite of expiation for it. He will take some of the bull’s blood and some of the goat’s blood and put it on the horns at the corners of the altar all around it, and sprinkle some of the blood on it seven times with his finger, thus purifying it and setting it apart from the uncleanness of the Israelites. </p>

<p>“Once expiation for the sanctuary, the Tent of Meeting and the altar is complete, he will bring the goat which is still alive. Aaron will then lay both his hands on its head and over it confess all the guilt of the Israelites, all their acts of rebellion and all their sins. Having thus laid them on the goat’s head, he will send it out into the desert under the charge of a man waiting ready, and the goat will bear all their guilt away into some desolate place. </p>

<p>“When he has sent the goat into the desert, Aaron will go back into the Tent of Meeting and take off the linen vestments which he wore to enter the sanctuary and leave them there. He will then wash his body inside the holy place, put on his vestments and come outside to offer his own and the people’s burnt offering. He will perform the rite of expiation for himself and for the people, and burn the fat of the sacrifice for sin on the altar. </p>

<p>“The man who led the goat away to Azazel will wash his clothes and body before entering the camp. The bull and the goat offered as a sacrifice for sin, the blood of which was taken into the sanctuary for the rite of expiation, must be taken outside the camp, where their skin, meat and offal are to be burnt. The man who burns them will wash his clothes and body before entering the camp. </p>

<p>“This will be a perpetual law for you. </p>

<p>“On the tenth day of the seventh month you will fast and refrain 
from work, both citizen and resident alien; for this is the day on which the rite of expiation will be performed for you to purify you, to purify you before Yahweh from all your sins. It will be a sabbatical rest for you and you will fast. This is a perpetual law. </p>

<p>The rite of expiation will be performed by the priest who has been anointed and installed to officiate in succession to his father. He will put on the linen vestments, the sacred vestments, and perform the rite of expiation for the holy sanctuary, the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and will then perform the rite of expiation for the priests and all the people of the community. This will be a perpetual law for you; once a year the rite of expiation will be made for the Israelites for all their sins”. </p>

<p>And as Yahweh ordered Moses, so it was done. </p>

<h2 id="iv">IV: The Law of Holiness (17:1–26:46)</h2>

<h4>Slaughtering and sacrifice (17:1–16)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Speak to Aaron and his sons and all the Israelites and say: </p>

<p>‘This is the order that Yahweh has given: </p>

<p>‘Any man of the House of Israel who slaughters a bull, lamb or goat, whether inside the camp or outside it, without bringing it to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting to make an offering of it to Yahweh in front of his Dwelling, that man will be answerable for bloodshed; he has shed blood, and that man will be outlawed from his people. The purpose of this is that the Israelites should instead bring their sacrifices, which they would otherwise offer in the countryside, to Yahweh at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, to the priest, and offer them as communion sacrifices to Yahweh; and the priest will sprinkle the blood on Yahweh’s altar at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and will burn the fat as a smell pleasing to Yahweh. No longer may they offer their sacrifices to the satyrs in whose service they used to prostitute themselves. This is a perpetual law for them and for their descendants’. </p>

<p>“You will also say to them, ‘Any member of the House of Israel or any resident alien who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice without bringing it to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting to offer it to Yahweh, will be outlawed from his people. </p>

<p>‘If any member of the House of Israel or any resident alien consumes blood of any kind, I shall set my face against that individual who consumes blood and shall outlaw him from his people. For the life of the creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you for performing the rite of expiation on the altar for your lives, for blood is what expiates for a life. That is why I told the Israelites: None of you will consume blood, nor will any resident alien consume blood. </p>

<p>‘Anyone, whether Israelite or resident alien, who hunts and catches game, whether animal or bird, which it is lawful to eat, must pour out its blood and cover it with earth. For the life of every creature is its blood, and I have told the Israelites: You will not consume the blood of any creature, for the life of every creature is its blood, and anyone who consumes it will be outlawed. </p>

<p>‘Anyone, citizen or alien, who eats an animal that has died a natural death or been savaged, must wash clothing and body, and will be unclean until evening, but will then be clean. But anyone who does not wash clothing and body will bear the consequences of his guilt’”. </p>

<h4>Sexual prohibitions (18:1–30)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Speak to the Israelites and say: </p>

<p>‘I am Yahweh your God: You must not behave as they do in Egypt where you used to live; you must not behave as they do in Canaan where I am taking you, nor must you follow their laws. You must observe my customs and keep my laws, following them. </p>

<p>‘I, Yahweh, am your God: hence you will keep my laws and my customs. Whoëver complies with them will find life in them. </p>

<p>‘I am Yahweh. </p>

<p>‘None of you will approach a woman who is closely related to him, to have intercourse with her. I am Yahweh. </p>

<p>‘You will not have intercourse with your father or your mother. She is your mother — you will not have intercourse with her. </p>

<p>‘You will not have intercourse with your father’s wife; it is your father’s sexual prerogative. </p>

<p>‘You will not have intercourse with your sister, whether she is your father’s or your mother’s daughter. Whether she was born in the same house or elsewhere, you will not have intercourse with her. </p>

<p>‘You will not have intercourse with your son’s or your daughter’s daughter; for their sexual privacy is your own. </p>

<p>‘You will not have intercourse with the daughter of your father’s wife, born to your father. She is your sister; you will not have intercourse with her. </p>

<p>‘You will not have intercourse with your father’s sister; for she is your father’s own flesh and blood. </p>

<p>‘You will not have intercourse with your mother’s sister; for she is your mother’s own flesh and blood. </p>

<p>‘You will not have intercourse with your father’s brother; you will not approach his wife. She is your aunt. </p>

<p>‘You will not have intercourse with your daughter-in-law. She is your son’s wife; you will not have intercourse with her. </p>

<p>‘You will not have intercourse with your brother’s wife; it is your brother’s sexual prerogative. </p>

<p>‘You will not have intercourse with a woman and her daughter; nor will you take her son’s or her daughter’s daughter, to have intercourse with them. They are your own flesh and blood; it would be incest. </p>

<p>‘You will not take a woman and her sister into your harem at the same time, to have intercourse with the latter while the former is still alive. </p>

<p>‘You will not approach and have intercourse with a woman who is in a state of menstrual pollution. </p>

<p>‘Furthermore, you will not have intercourse with your fellow-citizen’s wife; you would become unclean by doing so. </p>

<p>‘You will not allow any of your children to be sacrificed to Molech, thus profaning the name of your God. I am Yahweh. </p>

<p>‘You will not have intercourse with a man as you would with a woman. This is a hateful thing. </p>

<p>‘You will not have intercourse with any kind of animal; you would become unclean by doing so. Nor will a woman offer herself to an animal, to have intercourse with it. This would be a violation of nature. </p>

<p>‘Do not make yourselves unclean by any of these practices, for it was by such things that the nations that I am driving out before you made themselves unclean. The country has become unclean; hence I am about to punish it for its guilt, and the country itself will vomit out its inhabitants. </p>

<p>‘You, however, must keep my laws and customs and not do any of these hateful things: none of your citizens, none of your resident aliens. For all these hateful things were done by the people who lived in the country before you, and the country became unclean. If you make it unclean, will it not vomit you out as it vomited out the nations there before you? Yes, anyone who does any of these hateful things, whatever it may be, any person doing so, will be outlawed from his people; so keep my rules and do not observe any of the hateful laws which were in force before you came; then you will not be made unclean by them. I am Yahweh your God’”. </p>

<h4>Moral and religious obligations (19:1–37)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Speak to the whole community of Israelites and say: </p>

<p>‘Be holy, for I, Yahweh your God, am holy. </p>

<p>‘Each of you will respect father and mother. </p>

<p>‘And you will keep my Sabbaths; I am Yahweh your God. </p>

<p>‘Do not turn to idols and do not cast metal gods for yourselves. I am Yahweh your God. </p>

<p>‘If you offer a communion sacrifice to Yahweh, make it in such a way as to be acceptable. It must be eaten the same day or the day after; whatever is left on the third day must be burnt. If eaten on the third day it would be rotten food and not be acceptable. Anyone who eats it must bear the consequences of this guilt, having profaned Yahweh’s holiness; that person will be outlawed from his people. </p>

<p>‘When you reap the harvest of your land, you will not reap to the very edges of the field, nor will you gather the gleanings of the harvest; nor will you strip your vineyard bare, nor pick up the fallen grapes. You will leave them for the poor and the stranger. I am Yahweh your God. </p>

<p>‘You will not steal, nor deal deceitfully or fraudulently with your fellow-citizen. You will not swear by my name with intent to deceive and thus profane the name of your God. I am Yahweh. You will not exploit or rob your fellow. You will not keep back the labourer’s wage until next morning. You will not curse the dumb or put an obstacle in the way of the blind, but will fear your God. I am Yahweh. </p>

<p>‘You will not be unjust in administering justice. You will neither be partial to the poor nor overawed by the great, but will administer justice to your fellow-citizen justly. You will not go about slandering your own family, nor will you put your neighbour’s life in jeopardy. I am Yahweh. You will not harbour hatred for your brother. You will reprove your fellow-countryman firmly and thus avoid burdening yourself with a sin. You will not exact vengeance on, or bear any sort of grudge against, the members of your race, but will love your neighbour as yourself. I am Yahweh. </p>

<p>‘You will keep my laws. </p>

<p>‘You will not mate your cattle with those of another kind; you will not sow two kinds of grain in your field; you will not wear a garment made from two kinds of fabric. </p>

<p>‘If someone has intercourse with a woman who is the concubine slave of a man from whom she has not been redeemed and she has not been given her freedom, he will be liable for a fine, but they will not incur death, since she was not a free woman. He will bring a sacrifice of reparation for Yahweh to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. This will be a ram of reparation, and with the ram of reparation the priest will perform the rite of expiation for him before Yahweh for the sin committed; and the sin he has committed will be forgiven. </p>

<p>‘Once you have entered the country and planted any kind of fruit tree, you will regard its fruit as uncircumcised. For three years you will count it as uncircumcised and it will not be eaten; in the fourth year, all its fruit will be consecrated to Yahweh in a feast of praise; and in the fifth year you may eat its fruit, so that it may yield you even more. I am Yahweh your God. </p>

<p>‘You will eat nothing with blood in it. You will not practise divination or magic. </p>

<p>‘You will not round off your hair at the edges or trim the edges of your beard. You will not gash your bodies when someone dies, and you will not tattoo yourselves. I am Yahweh. </p>

<p>‘Do not profane your daughter by making her a prostitute, or the country itself will become prostituted and filled with incest. </p>

<p>‘You will keep my Sabbaths and revere my sanctuary. I am Yahweh. </p>

<p>‘Do not have recourse to the spirits of the dead or to magicians; they will defile you. I, Yahweh, am your God. </p>

<p>‘You will stand up in the presence of grey hair, you will honour the person of the aged and fear your God. I am Yahweh. </p>

<p>‘If you have resident aliens in your country, you will not molest them. You will treat resident aliens as though they were native-born and love them as yourself — for you yourselves were once aliens in Egypt. I am Yahweh your God. </p>

<p>‘You will not be unjust in administering justice as regards measures of length, weight or capacity. You will have just scales, just weights, a just ephah and a just hin. I am Yahweh your God who brought you out of Egypt; hence you are to keep all my laws and all my customs and put them into practice. I am Yahweh’”. </p>

<h4>Penalties (20:1–21)</h4>

<h5>a: Relgious offences (20:1–7)</h5>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Say to the Israelites: </p>

<p>‘Anyone, be he Israelite or alien resident in Israel, who gives any of his children to Molech, will be put to death. The people of the country must stone him, and I shall set my face against that man and outlaw him from his people; for by giving a child of his to Molech he has defiled my sanctuary and profaned my holy name. If the people of the country choose to close their eyes to the man’s action when he gives a child of his to Molech, and do not put him to death, I myself shall turn my face against that man and his clan. I shall outlaw them from their people, both him and all those after him who prostitute themselves by following Molech. </p>

<p>‘If anyone has recourse to the spirits of the dead or to magicians, to prostitute himself by following them, I shall set my face against him and outlaw him from his people. </p>

<p>‘Sanctify yourselves and be holy, for I am Yahweh your God. </p>

<h5>b: Offences against the family (20:8–21)</h5>

<p>‘You will keep my laws and put them into practice, for it is I, Yahweh, who make you holy. Hence: </p>

<p>‘Anyone who curses father or mother will be put to death. Having cursed father or mother, the blood will be on that person’s own head. </p>

<p>‘The man who commits adultery with his neighbour’s wife will be put to death, he and the woman. </p>

<p>‘The man who has intercourse with his father’s wife has infringed his father’s sexual prerogative. Both of them will be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. </p>

<p>‘The man who has intercourse with his daughter-in-law: both of them will be put to death; they have violated nature, their blood will be on their own heads. </p>

<p>‘The man who has intercourse with a man in the same way as with a woman: they have done a hateful thing together; they will be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. </p>

<p>‘The man who marries a woman and her mother: this is incest. They will be burnt alive, he and they; you will not tolerate incest. </p>

<p>‘The man who has intercourse with an animal will be put to death; you will kill the animal too. </p>

<p>‘The woman who approaches any animal to have intercourse with it: you will kill the woman and the animal. They will be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. </p>

<p>‘The man who marries his father’s or his mother’s daughter: if they have intercourse together, this is an outrage. They will be executed in public, for the man has had intercourse with his sister; he will bear the consequences of his guilt. </p>

<p>‘The man who has intercourse with a woman during her monthly periods and exposes her nakedness: he has laid bare the source of her blood, and she has exposed the source of her blood, and both of them will be outlawed from their people. </p>

<p>‘You will not have intercourse with your mother’s sister or your father’s sister. Whoëver does so, has had intercourse with a close relation; they will bear the consequences of their guilt. </p>

<p>‘The man who has intercourse with the wife of his paternal uncle has infringed his uncle’s sexual prerogative; they will bear the consequences of their guilt and die childless. </p>

<p>‘The man who marries his brother’s wife: this is pollution; he has infringed his brother’s sexual prerogative; they will die childless. </p>

<h4>Concluding exhortation (20:22–27)</h4>

<p>‘You will keep all my laws, all my decisions, and put them into practice, so that the country where I am taking you to live will not vomit you out. You will not follow the laws of the nations whom I am driving out before you; they practised all these things, which is why I detested them. As I have already told you, you will take possession of their soil, I myself shall give you possession of it, a country flowing with milk and honey. </p>

<p>‘Since I, Yahweh your God, have set you apart from these peoples, you for your part will make a distinction between clean animals and unclean ones and between unclean birds and clean ones, and will not make yourselves detestable with any animal or bird or reptile, which I have set apart from you as unclean. </p>

<p>‘Be consecrated to me, for I, Yahweh, am holy, and I shall set you apart from all these peoples, for you to be mine. </p>

<p>‘Any man or woman of yours who is a necromancer or magician will be put to death; they will be stoned to death; their blood will be on their own heads’”. </p>

<h4>The holiness of the priesthood (21:1–24)</h4>

<h5>a: The priests (21:1–9)</h5>

<p>Yahweh said to Moses: </p>

<p>“Speak to the priests descended from Aaron and say: </p>

<p>‘None of them must make himself unclean by touching the corpse of one of his people, unless it be of one of his closest relations — father, mother, son, daughter, brother, or virgin sister, since she being unmarried is still his close relation: he can make himself unclean for her; but for a close female relation who is married he will not make himself unclean; he would profane himself. </p>

<p>‘They will not make tonsures on their heads, shave the edges of their beards, or gash their bodies. They will be consecrated to their God and will not profane the name of their God. For their function is to offer the food burnt for Yahweh, the food of their God, and so they must be holy. </p>

<p>‘They will not marry a woman profaned by prostitution, or one divorced by her husband, for the priest is consecrated to his God. </p>

<p>‘You will treat him as holy, for he offers the food of your God. For you, he will be a holy person, for I, Yahweh, who sanctify you, am holy. </p>

<p>‘If a priest’s daughter profanes herself by prostitution, she profanes her father and will be burnt alive. </p>

<h5>b: The high priest (21:10–15)</h5>

<p>‘The priest who is preëminent over his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil has been poured, and who, robed in the sacred vestments, has received investiture, will not disorder his hair or tear his clothes; he will not go near any corpse or make himself unclean even for his father or mother. He will not leave the holy place in such a way as to profane the sanctuary of his God; for he bears the consecration of the anointing oil of his God. I am Yahweh. </p>

<p>‘He will marry a woman who is still a virgin. He will not marry a woman who has been widowed or divorced or profaned by prostitution, but will marry a virgin from his own people: he must not make his own children profane, for I, Yahweh, have sanctified him’”. </p>

<h5>c: Impediments to the priesthood (21:16–24)</h5>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Speak to Aaron and say: </p>

<p>‘None of your descendants, for all time, may come forward to offer the food of his God if he has any infirmity, for none may come forward if he has an infirmity, be he blind or lame, disfigured or deformed, or with an injured foot or arm, a hunchback, someone with rickets or ophthalmia or the scab or running sores, or a eunuch. No descendant of the priest Aaron may come forward to offer the food burnt for Yahweh if he has any infirmity; if he has an infirmity, he will not come forward to offer the food of his God. </p>

<p>‘He may eat the food of his God, things especially holy and things holy, but he will not go near the curtain or approach the altar, since he has an infirmity and must not profane my holy things; for I, Yahweh, have sanctified them’”. </p>

<p>And Moses promulgated this to Aaron, to his sons, and to all the Israelites. </p>

<h4>Holiness in consuming sacred food (22:1–33)</h4>

<h5>a: The priests (22:1–9)</h5>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Speak to Aaron and his sons. They must be consecrated by the holy offerings of the Israelites and must not profane my holy name; for my sake they must sanctify it; I am Yahweh. Say to them: </p>

<p>‘Any one of your descendants, for all time, who in a state of uncleanness approaches the holy offerings consecrated to Yahweh by the Israelites, will be outlawed from my presence. I am Yahweh. </p>

<p>‘Anyone of Aaron’s line who is afflicted with a contagious skin-disease or a discharge will not eat holy things until he is clean. Anyone who touches anything made unclean by a dead body, or who has a seminal discharge, or who is made unclean by touching any kind of reptile or any one who has contaminated him with his own uncleanness, be it what it may, in short, anyone who has had any such contact will be unclean until evening, and must not eat holy things until he has washed his body. At sunset he will be clean and may then eat holy things, for these are his food. </p>

<p>‘He must not eat an animal that has died a natural death or been savaged; he would contract uncleanness from it. I am Yahweh. </p>

<p>‘They must keep my rules and not burden themselves with sin. If they profane them, they will incur death; I, Yahweh, have sanctified them. </p>

<h5>b: Lay people (22:10–16)</h5>

<p>‘No lay person may eat anything holy; no guest or employee of a priest may eat anything holy. But if the priest has acquired a slave by purchase, the slave may eat it like anyone born in his household; they will share his food. </p>

<p>‘If a priest’s daughter marries a layman, she will have no share in the holy things set aside, but if she is widowed or divorced and, being childless, has had to return to her father’s house as when she was young, she may share her father’s food. No lay person may share it; anyone who does eat a holy thing by inadvertence, will restore it to the priest with one-fifth added. </p>

<p>‘They may not profane the holy offerings which the Israelites have set aside for Yahweh. By eating these, they would burden them with guilt requiring a sacrifice of reparation; for I, Yahweh, have sanctified these offerings’”. </p>

<h5>c: Sacrificial animals (22:17–30)</h5>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Speak to Aaron, to his sons, and to all the Israelites and say: </p>

<p>‘Any member of the House of Israel or any alien resident in Israel who brings an offering either in payment of a vow or as a voluntary gift, and offers it as a burnt offering to Yahweh, must, if he is to be acceptable, offer an unblemished male, be it bull or sheep or goat. You will not offer anything with a blemish, for it would not make you acceptable. </p>

<p>‘If anyone offers Yahweh a communion sacrifice, either to fulfil a vow or as a voluntary offering, the animal, be it from the herd or flock, must be perfect, if he is to be acceptable; it must be unblemished. You will not offer Yahweh any animal which is blind, lame, mutilated, ulcerous, scabby or covered in sores. No part of such an animal will be offered on the altar as food burnt for Yahweh. As a voluntary offering, you may offer a bull or a lamb that is underdeveloped or deformed; but such will not be acceptable in payment of a vow. You will not offer Yahweh an animal if its testicles have been bruised, crushed, torn or cut off. You may not do that in your country, and you may not accept any such from the hands of a stranger, to be offered as food for your God. Their deformity is a blemish, and they would not make you acceptable’”. </p>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“A calf, lamb, or kid will stay with its dam for seven days after being born. From the eighth day onwards, it will be acceptable as food burnt for Yahweh. But no animal, whether cow or ewe, will be slaughtered on the same day as its young. </p>

<p>“If you offer Yahweh a sacrifice with praise, do it in the acceptable manner; it must be eaten the same day; you will leave nothing over till next morning. I am Yahweh. </p>

<h5>d: Concluding exhortation (22:31–33)</h5>

<p>“You will keep my commands and put them into practice. I am Yahweh. You will not profane my holy name — so that I may be honoured as holy among the Israelites, I, Yahweh, who make you holy, I who brought you out of Egypt, to be your God, I, Yahweh”. </p>

<h4>The ritual for the annual feasts (23:1–36)</h4>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Speak to the Israelites and say: </p>

<p>(The solemn festivals of Yahweh to which you will summon them are 
my sacred assemblies.) </p>

<p>‘These are my solemn festivals: </p>

<h5>a: The Sabbath (23:3–4)</h5>

<p>‘You will work for six days, but the seventh will be a day of complete rest, a day for the sacred assembly on which you do no work at all. Wherever you live, this is a Sabbath for Yahweh. </p>

<p>‘These are Yahweh’s solemn festivals, the sacred assemblies to which you will summon the Israelites on the appointed day: </p>

<h5>b: The passover and the feast of Unleavened Bread (23:5–8)</h5>

<p>‘The fourteenth day of the first month, at twilight, is the Passover of Yahweh; and the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of Unleavened Bread for Yahweh. For seven days you will eat unleavened bread. On the first day you will hold a sacred assembly; you will do no heavy work. For seven days you will offer food burnt for Yahweh. On the seventh day there will be a sacred assembly; you will do no heavy work’”. </p>

<h5>c: The first sheaf (23:9–14)</h5>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Speak to the Israelites and say: </p>

<p>‘When you enter the country which I am giving you and reap the 
harvest there, you will bring the priest the first sheaf of your harvest, and he will present it to Yahweh with the gesture of offering, for you to be acceptable. The priest will make this offering on the day after the Sabbath, and on the same day as you make this offering, you will offer Yahweh an unblemished lamb one year old as a burnt offering. The cereal offering for that day will be two-tenths of wheaten flour mixed with oil, as food burnt as a smell pleasing to Yahweh. The libation will be a quarter of a hin of wine. You will eat no bread, roasted ears of wheat or fresh produce before this day, before making the offering to your God. This is a perpetual law for all your descendants, wherever you live. </p>

<h5>d: The feast of Weeks (23:15–22)</h5>

<p>‘From the day after the Sabbath, the day on which you bring the sheaf of offering, you will count seven full weeks. You will count fifty days, to the day after the seventh Sabbath, and then you will offer Yahweh a new 
cereal offering. You will bring bread from your homes to present with the gesture of offering — two loaves, made of two-tenths of wheaten flour baked with leaven; these are first-fruits for Yahweh. In addition to the bread, you will offer seven unblemished lambs a year old, a young bull and two rams, as a burnt offering to Yahweh with a cereal offering and a libation, as food burnt as a smell pleasing to Yahweh. You will also offer a goat as a sacrifice for sin, and two lambs a year old as communion sacrifice. The priest will present them before Yahweh with the gesture of offering, in addition to the bread of the first-fruits. These, and the two lambs, are holy things for Yahweh, and will revert to the priest. </p>

<p>‘On the same day, you will hold an assembly; for you this will be a sacred assembly; you will do no heavy work. This is a perpetual law for your descendants, wherever you live. </p>

<p>‘When you reap the harvest in your country, you will not reap to the very edges of your field, nor will you gather the gleanings of the harvest. You will leave them for the poor and the stranger. I am Yahweh your God’”. </p>

<h5>e: The first day of the seventh month (23:23–25)</h5>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Speak to the Israelites and say: </p>

<p>‘The first day of the seventh month will be a day of rest for you, of 
remembrance and acclamation, a sacred assembly. You will do no heavy work and you will offer food burnt for Yahweh’.</p>

<h5>f: The day of Expiation (23:26–32)</h5>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“But the tenth day of this seventh month will be the Day of Expiation. You will hold a sacred assembly. You will fast and offer food burnt for Yahweh. You will do no work that day, for it is the Day of Expiation, on which the rite of expiation will be performed for you before Yahweh your God. Anyone who fails to fast that day will be outlawed from his people; anyone who works that day I shall eliminate from his people. No work will be done — this is a perpetual law for your descendants wherever you live. It must be a day of complete rest for you. You will fast; on the evening of the ninth day of the month, from this evening until the following evening, you will rest completely”. </p>

<h5>g: The feast of Shelters (23:33–36)</h5>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Speak to the Israelites and say: </p>

<p>‘On the fifteenth day of this seventh month there will be the feast of 
Shelters for Yahweh, lasting for seven days. The first day will be a day of sacred assembly; you will do no heavy work. For seven days you will offer food burnt for Yahweh. On the eighth day you will hold a sacred assembly and you will offer food burnt for Yahweh. It is a day of solemn meeting; you will do no heavy work. </p>

<h4>Conclusion (23:37–38)</h4>

<p>‘These are Yahweh’s solemn festivals to which you will summon the Israelites, the sacred assemblies for the purpose of offering food burnt for Yahweh, consisting of burnt offerings, cereal offerings, sacrifices and libations, each on its appropriate day, besides Yahweh’s Sabbaths, and your presents and all your votive and voluntary gifts that you make to Yahweh. </p>

<h4>Recapitulation on the feast of Shelters</h4>

<p> ‘But on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the produce of the land, you will celebrate the feast of Yahweh for seven days. The first and eighth days will be days of rest. On the first day you will take choice fruit, palm branches, boughs of leafy trees and flowering shrubs from the river bank, and for seven days enjoy yourselves before Yahweh your God. You will celebrate a feast for Yahweh in this way for seven days every year. This is a perpetual law for your descendants. </p>

<p>‘You will keep this feast in the seventh month. For seven days you will live in shelters: all the citizens of Israel will live in shelters, so that your descendants may know that I made the Israelites live in shelters when I brought them out of Egypt, I, Yahweh your God’”. </p>

<p>Moses then promulgated Yahweh’s solemn festivals to the Israelites. </p>

<h4>Complementary ritual prescriptions (24:1–9)</h4>

<h5>a: the perpetual flame (24:1–4)</h5>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Order the Israelites to bring you crushed-olive oil for the lamp-stand, and keep a flame burning there continually. Aaron will keep it permanently in trim from evening to morning, outside the curtain of the Testimony in the Tent of Meeting, before Yahweh. This is a perpetual decree for your descendants: Aaron will keep the lamps permanently trimmed on the pure lamp-stand before Yahweh. </p>

<h5>b: the loaves of permanent offering on the golden table (245–9)</h5>

<p>“You will take wheaten flour and with it bake twelve loaves, each of two-tenths of an ephah. You will then place them in two rows of six on the pure table before Yahweh and put pure incense on each row, to make it food offered as a memorial, food burnt for Yahweh. Every Sabbath they will be arranged before Yahweh. The Israelites will provide them as a permanent 
covenant. They will belong to Aaron and his sons, who will eat them inside the holy place since, for him, they are an especially holy part of the food burnt for Yahweh. This is a permanent law”. </p>

<h4>A case of blasphemy. The law of retaliation (24:10–23)</h4>

<p>There was a man whose mother was an Israelite woman and whose father was an Egyptian. He came out of his house and, in the camp, surrounded by the Israelites, he began to quarrel with a man who was an Israelite. Now the son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name and cursed it. He was then taken to Moses (his mother’s name was Shelomith daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan). He was then put under guard until Yahweh’s will should be made clear to them. Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Take the man who pronounced the curse outside the camp. All those who heard him must then lay their hands on his head, and the whole community must then stone him. Then say to the Israelites: </p>

<p>‘Anyone who curses his God will bear the consequences of his sin, and anyone who blasphemes the name of Yahweh will be put to death; the whole community will stone him; be he alien or native-born, if he blasphemes the Name, he will be put to death. </p>

<p>‘Anyone who strikes down any other human being will be put to death. </p>

<p>‘Anyone who strikes down an animal will make restitution for it: a life for a life. </p>

<p>‘Anyone who injures a neighbour shall receive the same in return, broken limb for broken limb, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. As the injury inflicted, so will be the injury suffered. Whoëver strikes down an animal will make restitution for it, and whoëver strikes down a human being will be put to death. The sentence you pass will be the same, whether on native-born or on alien; for I am Yahweh your God’”. </p>

<p>Moses having told the Israelites this, they took the man who had pronounced the curse out of the camp and stoned him. And so the Israelites carried out Yahweh’s order to Moses. </p>

<h4>The holy years (25:1–17)</h4>

<h5>a: The sabbatical year (25:1–7)</h5>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai and said: </p>

<p>“Speak to the Israelites and say to them: </p>

<p>‘When you enter the country which I am giving you, the land 
must keep a Sabbath’s rest for Yahweh. For six years you will sow your field, for six years you will prune your vineyard and gather its produce. But in the seventh year the land will have a sabbatical rest, a Sabbath for Yahweh. You will neither sow your field, nor prune your vineyard, nor reap any grain which has grown of its own accord, nor gather the grapes from your untrimmed vine. It will be a year of rest for the land. But what the land produces in its Sabbath will serve to feed you, your slave, male or female, your employee and your guest residing with you; for your cattle too, and the wild animals of your country, whatever it produces will serve as food. </p>

<h5>b: The year of jubilee (25:8–17)</h5>

<p>‘You will count seven weeks of years — seven times seven years, that is to say a period of seven weeks of years, forty-nine years. And on the tenth day of the seventh month you will sound the trumpet; on the Day of Expiation you will sound the trumpet throughout the land. You will declare this fiftieth year to be sacred and proclaim the liberation of all the country’s inhabitants. You will keep this as a jubilee: each of you will return to his ancestral property, each to his own clan. This fiftieth year will be a jubilee year for you; in it you will not sow, you will not harvest the grain that has come up on its own or in it gather grapes from your untrimmed vine. The jubilee will be a holy thing for you; during it you will eat whatever the fields produce. </p>

<p>‘In this year of jubilee, each of you will return to his ancestral property. If you buy land from, or sell land to, your fellow-countryman, neither of you may exploit the other. In buying from your fellow-countryman, you will take account of the number of years since the jubilee; the sale-price he fixes for you will depend on the number of productive years still to run. The greater the number of years, the higher the price you will ask for it; the fewer the number of years, the greater the reduction; for what he is selling you is a certain number of harvests. So you will not exploit one another, but fear your God, for I am Yahweh your God. </p>

<h4>Divine guarantee for the sabbatical year (25:18–22)</h4>

<p>‘Hence, you will put my laws and customs into practice; you will keep them and put them into practice, and you will live securely in the country. The land will give its fruit, and you will eat your fill and live in security. </p>

<p>‘In case you should ask: What shall we eat in this seventh year if we do not sow or harvest our produce? I shall order my blessing to be on you in the sixth year, which will yield you enough produce for three years. You will have the old produce to eat while you are sowing in the eighth year, and even in the ninth year, you will be eating the old produce, while waiting for the harvest of that year. </p>

<h4>Redemption of land (25:23–34)</h4>

<p>‘Land will not be sold absolutely, for the land belongs to me, and you are only strangers and guests of mine. You will allow a right of redemption over any ancestral property. If your brother becomes impoverished and sells off part of his ancestral property, his nearest male relative will come and exercise his family rights over what his brother has sold. The man who has no one to exercise this right may, once he has found the means to effect the redemption, calculate the number of years that the alienation would have lasted, repay to the purchaser the sum due for the time still to run, and so recover his ancestral property. If he cannot find the sum in compensation, the property sold will remain in the possession of the purchaser until the jubilee year. In the jubilee year, the latter will vacate it and return to his own ancestral property. </p>

<p>‘If anyone sells a dwelling house inside a walled town, he will have the right of redemption until the expiry of the year following the sale. His right of redemption is limited to the year; and if the redemption has not been effected by the end of the year, the house in the walled town will become the property of the purchaser and his descendants in perpetuity; he need not vacate it at the jubilee. But houses in villages not enclosed by walls will be considered as situated in the open country; they carry the right of redemption, and the purchaser will vacate them at the jubilee. </p>

<p>‘As regards the towns of the Levites, town houses forming part of their ancestral property will carry a perpetual right of redemption in their favour. If a Levite is the one to be affected by the right of redemption, at the jubilee he will vacate the purchased property and return to his own home, to the town in which he has a title to property. The houses in the Levites’ towns represent their ancestral property in Israel, and the arable land depending on these towns cannot be sold, being their ancestral property for ever. </p>

<h4>Redemption of persons (25:35–55)</h4>

<p>‘If your brother becomes impoverished and cannot support himself in the community, you will assist him as you would a stranger or guest, so that he can go on living with you. Do not charge him interest on a loan, but fear your God, and let your brother live with you. You will not lend him money on interest or give him food to make a profit out of it. I am Yahweh your God who brought you out of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and be your God. </p>

<p>‘If your brother becomes impoverished while with you and sells himself to you, you will not make him do the work of a slave; you will treat him like an employee or guest, and he will work for you until the jubilee year. He will then leave you, both he and his children, and return to his clan and regain possession of his ancestral property. For they are my servants whom I have brought out of Egypt, and they may not be bought and sold as slaves. You will not oppress your brother-lsraelites harshly but will fear your God. </p>

<p>‘The male and female slaves you have will come from the nations round you; from these you may purchase male and female slaves. As slaves, you may also purchase the children of aliens resident among you, and also members of their families living with you who have been born on your soil; and they will become your property, and you may leave them as a legacy to your sons after you as their perpetual possession. These you may have for slaves; but you will not oppress your brother-lsraelites. </p>

<p>‘If a stranger or guest living with you gets rich and your brother, in the course of dealings with him, becomes impoverished and sells himself to this stranger or guest, or to the descendant of a stranger’s family, he will enjoy the right of redemption after being sold, and one of his brothers may redeem him. His paternal uncle, his uncle’s son, or a member of his own family may redeem him; if he has the means, he may redeem himself. By agreement with his purchaser, he will count the number of years between the year of sale and the jubilee year; his sale-price will be proportionate to the number of years, his time being valued as that of an employee. If there are still many years to run, in proportion to their number he will refund part of his sale-price as payment for his redemption. And if there are only a few years still to run before the jubilee year, he will calculate with him what should be refunded for his redemption, in proportion to their number, as though he were hired by the year. You will see to it that he is not harshly oppressed. </p>

<p>‘If he has not been redeemed in any of these ways, he will go free in the jubilee year, both he and his children; for the Israelites are my servants; they are my servants whom I brought out of Egypt. I am Yahweh your God’”. </p>

<h4>Summary: conclusion (26:1–2)</h4>

<p>“‘You will not make idols for yourselves; you will not erect statues or cultic stones, or erect carved stones in your country, for you to worship: for I, Yahweh, am your God. You will keep my Sabbaths and revere my sanctuary. I am Yahweh. </p>

<h4>Blessings (26:3–13)</h4>

<p>‘If you live according to my laws, if you keep my commandments and put them into practice, I shall give you the rain you need at the right time; the soil will yield its produce and the trees of the countryside their fruit; you will thresh until vintage time and gather grapes until sowing time. You will eat your fill of bread and live secure in your land. </p>

<p>‘I shall give peace in the land, and you will go to sleep with no one to frighten you. I shall rid the land of beasts of prey. The sword will not pass through your land. You will pursue your enemies and they will fall before your sword; five of you pursuing a hundred of them, one hundred pursuing ten thousand; and your enemies will fall before your sword. </p>

<p>‘I shall turn towards you, I shall make you fertile and make your numbers grow, and I shall uphold my covenant with you. </p>

<p>‘Having eaten all you need of last year’s harvest, you will throw out the old to make room for the new. </p>

<p>‘I shall fix my home among you and never reject you. I shall live among you; I shall be your God and you will be my people, I, Yahweh your God, who brought you out of Egypt so that you should be their slaves no longer, and who broke the bonds of your yoke and made you walk with head held high. </p>

<h4>Curses (26:14–46)</h4>

<p>‘But if you will not listen to me and do not put all these commandments into practice, if you reject my laws and detest my customs, and you break my covenant by not putting all my commandments into practice, this is how I shall treat you: </p>

<p>‘I shall subject you to terror, consumption and fever, making you dim of sight and short of breath. You will sow your seed in vain, for your enemies will eat it. I shall turn against you and you will be defeated by your enemies. Your foes will have the mastery over you, and you will flee when no one is pursuing you. </p>

<p>‘And if, in spite of this, you will not listen to me, I shall punish you seven times over for your sins. I shall break your proud strength. I shall make the sky like iron for you, and your soil like bronze. You will wear out your strength in vain, your land will not yield its produce, nor the trees of the country their fruit. </p>

<p>‘And if you go against me and will not listen to me, I shall heap seven times more plagues on you for your sins. I shall send wild animals to attack you and rob you of your children, destroy your cattle and reduce your numbers until your roads are deserted. </p>

<p>‘And if that does not reform you, and you still go against me, then I shall go against you and punish you another seven times over for your sins. I shall bring the sword on you, which will avenge the covenant, and when you huddle inside your towns, I shall send pestilence among you, and you will fall into the enemy’s clutches. When I take away the bread which supports you, ten women will be able to bake your bread in one oven and will then dole your bread out by weight; you will eat but not be satisfied. </p>

<p>‘And if, in spite of this, you will not listen to me but go against me, I shall go against you in fury and punish you seven times over for your sins. You will eat the flesh of your own sons, you will eat the flesh of your own daughters. I shall destroy your high places and smash your incense-altars; I shall pile your corpses on the corpses of your foul idols and shall reject you. I shall reduce your cities to ruins; I shall lay waste your sanctuary and refuse to inhale from you smells intended to please. I shall make such a desolation of the country that your enemies who come to live there will be appalled by it. And I shall scatter you among the nations. I shall unsheathe the sword against you, reducing your country to desert and your towns to ruins. Then the country will indeed observe its Sabbaths, all the while it lies deserted, while you are in the country of your enemies. Then indeed the country will rest and observe its Sabbaths. And as it lies deserted it will rest, as it never did on your Sabbaths when you were living there. I shall strike such fear into the hearts of those of you who survive in the countries of their enemies that the sound of a falling leaf will set them fleeing; they will flee as though fleeing from the sword, and fall when no one is pursuing. They will stumble over one another as though fleeing before the sword, when no one is pursuing. You will be powerless to stand up to your enemies; you will perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies will swallow you up. Those of you who survive will pine away in their guilt in the countries of their enemies and, bearing the guilt of their ancestors too, will pine away like them. </p>

<p>‘Then they shall admit their guilt and that of their ancestors and their infidelities against me, and further, their setting themselves against me. </p>

<p>‘I in my turn will go against them and bring them into the land of their enemies. Then their uncircumcised hearts will grow humble and then they will accept the punishment for their guilt. I shall remember my covenant with Jacob, I shall remember my covenant with Isaac and my covenant with Abraham; and I shall remember the country too. </p>

<p>‘Abandoned, the country will keep its Sabbaths, as it lies deserted in their absence, and they will have to accept the punishment for their guilt, since they detested my customs and rejected my laws. </p>

<p>‘Yet, in spite of all this, when they are in the land of their enemies, I shall not so utterly reject or detest them as to destroy them completely and break my covenant with them; for I am Yahweh their God. For their sake I shall remember the covenant I made with those first generations that I brought out of Egypt while other nations watched, so that I should be their God, I, Yahweh’”. </p>

<p>Such were the decrees, customs and laws which Yahweh established between himself and the Israelites on Mount Sinai through Moses. </p>

<h2 id="a">Appendix (27:1–34)</h2>

<h3>Tariffs and Valuations</h3>

<h5>a: Persons (27:1–8)</h5>

<p>Yahweh spoke to Moses and said: </p>

<p>“Speak to the Israelites and say: </p>

<p>‘If anyone vows the value of a person to Yahweh and wishes to 
discharge the vow: </p>

<p>‘a man between twenty and sixty years of age will be valued at fifty silver shekels — the sanctuary shekel; a woman will be valued at thirty shekels; </p>

<p>‘between five and twenty years, a boy will be valued at twenty shekels, a girl at ten shekels; </p>

<p>‘between one month and five years, a boy will be valued at five silver shekels, a girl at three silver shekels; </p>

<p>‘at sixty years and over, a man will be valued at fifteen shekels and a woman at ten shekels. </p>

<p>‘If the person who made the vow cannot meet this valuation, he will present the person concerned to the priest, and the priest will set a value proportionate to the resources of the person who made the vow. </p>

<h5>b: Animals (27:9–13)</h5>

<p>‘In the case of an animal suitable for offering to Yahweh, any such animal given to Yahweh will be holy. It cannot be exchanged or replaced, a good one instead of a bad one, or a bad one instead of a good one. If one animal is substituted for another, both of them will become holy. In the case of an unclean animal unsuitable for offering to Yahweh, whatever it may be, it will be presented to the priest and he will set a value on it, in relation to its worth. His valuation will be decisive; but if the person wishes to redeem it, he will add one-fifth to the valuation. </p>

<h5>c: Houses (27:14–15)</h5>

<p>‘If a man consecrates his house to Yahweh, the priest will set a value on it, in relation to its worth. His valuation will be decisive. If the man who has vowed his house wishes to redeem it, he will add one-fifth to the valuation, and it will revert to him. </p>

<h5>d: Fields (27:16–25)</h5>

<p>‘If a man consecrates one of the fields of his ancestral property to Yahweh, its value will be calculated in terms of its yield, at the rate of fifty silver shekels to one <i>homer</i> of barley. </p>

<p>‘If he consecrates the field during the jubilee year, he will abide by this valuation. But if he consecrates it after the jubilee, the priest will calculate the price in terms of the number of years still to run until the next jubilee and the valuation will be reduced accordingly. </p>

<p>‘If he wishes to redeem the field, he will add one-fifth to the valuation, and the field will revert to him. If he does not redeem it but sells it to someone else, the right of redemption ceases; when the purchaser has to vacate it at the jubilee year, it becomes consecrated to Yahweh, like a field vowed unconditionally; ownership of it passes to the priest. </p>

<p>‘If he consecrates to Yahweh a field which he has bought, but which is not part of his ancestral property, the priest will calculate the valuation in terms of the number of years still to run before the jubilee year; and the man will pay this sum the same day since it is consecrated to Yahweh. In the jubilee year the field will revert to the vendor, the man to whose ancestral property the land belongs. All your valuations will be made in sanctuary shekels, at the rate of twenty <i>gerah</i> to the shekel. </p>

<h4>Particular rules for the redemption (27:26–34)</h4>

<h5>a: of the first-born (27:26–27)</h5>

<p>‘The first-born of livestock is born to Yahweh; no one may consecrate it, whether it be cattle or sheep, for it belongs to Yahweh anyway. But if it is an unclean animal, it may be redeemed at the valuation price with one-fifth added; if the animal is not redeemed, it will be sold at the valuation price. </p>

<h5>b: of things vowed unconditionally (27:28–29)</h5>

<p>‘Nothing, however, that someone vows unconditionally to Yahweh may be redeemed, nothing he possesses, be it a human being or animal or field of his ancestral property. What is vowed unconditionally is especially holy and belongs to Yahweh. A human being vowed unconditionally cannot be redeemed but will be put to death. </p>

<h5>c: of tithes (27:30–34)</h5>

<p>‘All tithes on land, levied on the produce of the soil or on the fruit of trees, belong to Yahweh; they are consecrated to Yahweh. If anyone wishes to redeem part of his tithe, he will add one-fifth to its value. </p>

<p>‘In all tithes on herds or flocks, the tenth animal of all that pass under the herdsman’s staff will be consecrated to Yahweh; there will be no examining whether it is good or bad, and no substitution. If substitution takes place, the animal and its substitute will both become holy without possibility of redemption’”.</p>

<p>Such were the orders which Yahweh gave Moses on Mount Sinai for the Israelites. </p>
