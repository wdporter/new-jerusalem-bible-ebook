<h4 id="ch1">Title (1:1)</h4>

<p>The word of Yahweh which came to Hosea son of Beeri during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah kings of Judah, and of Jeroboam son of Joash, king of Israel.</p>

<h2 id="i">I: The Marriage of Hosea and its Symbolism (1:2–3:5)</h2>

<h4>Hosea’s marriage: his three children (1:2–9)</h4>

<p>The beginning of what Yahweh said through Hosea:</p>

<p>Yahweh said to Hosea, “Go, marry a whore, and get children with a whore; for the country itself has become nothing but a whore by abandoning Yahweh”. So he went and married Gomer daughter of Diblaim, who conceived and bore him a son. Yahweh then said to him, “Call him Jezreel, for in a little while I shall punish the House of Jehu for the bloodshed at Jezreel and put an end to the sovereignty of the House of Israel. When that day comes, I shall break the bow of Israel in the Valley of Jezreel”.</p>

<p>She conceived a second time and gave birth to a daughter. Yahweh then said to him, “Call her Lo-Ruhamah, for I shall show no more pity for the House of Israel, I shall never forgive them again. (Instead, I shall take pity on the House of Judah and shall save them, not by bow or sword or force of arms, not by horses or horsemen, but by Yahweh their God.)”</p>

<p>After weaning Lo-Ruhamah, she conceived and gave birth to a son. Yahweh said, “Call him Lo-Ammi, for you are not my people and I do not exist for you”.</p>

<h4 id="ch2">Hope for the future (2:1–3)</h4>

<p>But the Israelites will become as numerous as the sands of the sea, which cannot be measured or counted. In the very place where they were told, “You are not my people”,</p>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>they will be told they are “Children of the living God”.</span><br />
		<span>The Judaeans and Israelites will be reünited</span><br />
		<span>and will choose themselves a single head,</span><br />
		<span>and will spread far beyond their country,</span><br />
		<span>for great will be the Day of Jezreel!</span><br />
		<span>Then call your brothers,  “My people”, </span><br />
		<span>and your sisters, “You have been pitied”.</span>
	</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Yahweh and his unfaithful wife (2:4–15)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>To court, take your mother to court!</span><br />
		<span>For she is no longer my wife</span><br />
		<span>nor am I her husband.</span><br />
		<span>She must either remove her whoring ways from her face</span><br />
		<span>and her adulteries from between her breasts,</span><br />
		<span>or I shall strip her and expose her</span><br />
		<span>naked as the day she was born;</span><br />
		<span>I shall make her as bare as the desert,</span><br />
		<span>I shall make her as dry as arid country,</span><br />
		<span>and let her die of thirst.</span><br />
		<span>And I shall feel no pity for her children</span><br />
		<span>since they are the children of her whorings.</span><br />
		<span>Yes, their mother has played the whore,</span><br />
		<span>she who conceived them has disgraced herself</span><br />
		<span>by saying, “I shall chase after my lovers;</span><br />
		<span>they will assure me my keep,</span><br />
		<span>my wool, my flax, my oil and my drinks”.</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>This is why I shall block her way with thorns,</span><br />
		<span>and wall her in to stop her in her tracks;</span><br />
		<span>then if she chases her lovers she will not catch them,</span><br />
		<span>if she looks for them she will not find them,</span><br />
		<span>and then she will say, “I shall go back to my first husband,</span><br />
		<span>I was better off then than I am now;”</span><br />
		<span>she had never realised before</span><br />
		<span>that I was the one who was giving her</span><br />
		<span>the grain, new wine and oil,</span><br />
		<span>giving her more and more silver and gold</span><br />
		<span>which they have spent on Baal!</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>This is why I shall take back my grain when it is due</span><br />
		<span>and my new wine, when the season for it comes.</span><br />
		<span>I shall withdraw my wool and my flax</span><br />
		<span>which were to cover her naked body,</span><br />
		<span>and then display her infamy before her lovers’ eyes —</span><br />
		<span>no one will take her from me then!</span><br />
		<span>I shall put an end to all her merrymaking,</span><br />
		<span>her festivals, her New Moons and her Sabbaths</span><br />
		<span>and all her solemn feasts.</span>
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>I shall make her vines and fig trees derelict</span><br />
		<span>of which she used to say,</span><br />
		<span>“These are the pay my lovers gave me”.</span><br />
		<span>I shall turn them into a jungle:</span><br />
		<span>wild animals will feed on them.</span><br />
		<span>I mean to make her pay for the feast-days</span><br />
		<span>on which she burnt incense to the Baals,</span><br />
		<span>when she tricked herself out in her earrings and necklaces</span><br />
		<span>to chase after her lovers,</span><br />
		<span>and forget me!</span><br />

		<span>and make the Vale of Achor a gateway of hope.</span><br />

	<p class="poem">

	<p class="poem">
		<span>When that day comes I shall make a treaty for them with the wild animals,</span><br />

<h4 id="ch3">Second account of Hosea’s marriage (3:1–3)</h4>

<p>Yahweh said to me, “Go again, love a woman who loves another man, an adulteress, and love her as Yahweh loves the Israelites although they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes”. </p>

<p>So I bought her for fifteen shekels of silver, a <i>homer</i> of barley and a skin of wine, and I said to her, “You will have to spend a long time waiting for me without playing the whore and without giving yourself to any man, and I will behave in the same way towards you”.</p>

<h4>The explanation (3:4–5)</h4>

<p>For the Israelites will have to spend a long time without king or leader, without sacrifice or sacred pillar, without <i>ephod</i> or domestic images; but after that, the Israelites will return and again seek Yahweh their God and David their king, and turn trembling to Yahweh for his bounty in the final days.</p>

<h4>General Corruption (4:1–3)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Israelites, hear what Yahweh says,</span><br />
		<span>for Yahweh indicts the citizens of the country: </span><br />
		<span>there is no loyalty, no faithful love, </span><br />
		<span>o knowledge of God in the country,</span><br />
		<span>only perjury and lying, murder, theft, </span><br />
		<span> adultery and violence, bloodshed after bloodshed.</span><br />
		<span>This is why the country is in mourning </span><br />
		<span>and all its citizens pining away, </span><br />
		<span>the wild animals also and birds of the sky, </span><br />
		<span>even the fish in the sea will disappear.</span>

<h4>Against the priests (4:4–11a)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">

		<span>it is you, priest, that I denounce.</span><br />
		<span>Priest, you will stumble in broad daylight, </span><br />
		<span>and the prophet will stumble with you in the dark, </span><br />
		<span>and I will make your mother perish.</span><br />
		<span>My people perish for want of knowledge. </span><br />
		<span>Since you yourself have rejected knowledge, </span><br />
		<span>so I shall reject you from my priesthood; </span><br />
		<span>since you have forgotten the teaching of your God, </span><br />
		<span>I in my turn shall forget your children.</span><br />
	</p>
	
	<p class="poem">
		<span>The more of them there have been,</span><br />
		<span>the more they have sinned against me;</span><br />
		<span>they have bartered their Glory for Shame.</span><br />
		<span>They feed on the sin of my people, </span><br />
		<span>they are greedy for their iniquity.</span><br />
		<span>But as with the people, so with the priest, </span><br />
		<span>I shall punish them for their conduct, </span><br />
		<span>I shall pay them back for their deeds.</span><br />
		<span>They will eat but never be satisfied, </span><br />
		<span>they will play the whore but not grow more prolific, </span><br />
		<span>since they have deserted Yahweh </span><br />
		<span>to give themselves up to whoring.</span>

<h4>Worship in Israel is idolatrous and debauched (4:11b–14)</h4>

<blockquote>
	<p class="poem">
		<span>Old wine and new wine addle my people’s wits,</span><br />
		<span>they consult their block of wood,</span><br />
		<span>and their stick explains what they should do.</span><br />
		<span>For an urge to go whoring has led them astray</span><br />
		<span>and whoring they go and desert their God;</span><br />
		<span>they offer sacrifice on the mountain tops,</span><br />
		<span>they burn incense on the hills,</span><br />
		<span>under oak and poplar and terebinth,</span><br />
		<span>for pleasant is their shade.</span><br />
		<span>So, although your daughters play the whore</span><br />
		<span>and your daughters-in-law commit adultery,</span><br />
		<span>I shall not punish your daughters for playing the whore</span><br />
		<span>nor your daughters-in-law for committing adultery,</span><br />
		<span>when the men themselves are wandering off with whores</span><br />
		<span>and offering sacrifice with sacred prostitutes,</span><br />
		<span>for a people with no understanding is doomed.</span>

<h4>A warning to Judah and Israel (4:15–19)</h4>

		<span>Do not go to Gilgal,</span><br />
		<span>do not go up to Beth-Aven,</span><br />
		<span>do not swear oaths “by Yahweh’s life”,</span><br />
		<span>for Israel is as stubborn</span><br />
		<span>as a stubborn heifer;</span><br />
		<span>so is Yahweh likely to pasture him</span><br />
		<span>like a lamb in a broad meadow?</span><br />
		<span>Ephraim has made a pact with idols — let him alone!</span><br />
		<span>Their drunken orgy over, </span><br />
		<span>they do nothing but play the whore, </span><br />
		<span>preferring Shame to their Pride;</span><br />
