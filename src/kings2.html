<h4>King Ahaziah of Israel (853–852) and the prophet Elijah (1 Kings 22:52–1:18)</h4>

<p>After Ahab’s death Moab rebelled against Israel.</p>


2Ki 1 :2 Ahaziah had fallen from the balcony of his upper room in Samaria, and was lying ill; so he sent
messengers, saying to them, “Go and consult Baal-Zebub god of Ekron and ask whether I shall recover from my
illness”.

2Ki 1 :3 But the angel of Yahweh said to Elijah the Tishbite, “Up! Go and intercept the king of Samaria’s
messengers. Say to them, ‘Is there no God in Israel, for you to go and consult Baal-Zebub god of Ekron?

2Ki 1:4 Yahweh says this: You will never leave the bed you have got into; you are certainly going to die’”. And
Elijah set out.

2Ki 1:5 The messengers returned to the king, who said, “Why have you come back?”.

2Ki 1 :6 “A man came to meet us”, they answered. “He said, ‘Go back to the king who sent you and tell him:
Yahweh says this: Is there no God in Israel, for you to go and consult Baal-Zebub god of Ekron? For this, you
will never leave the bed you have got into; you are certainly going to die’”.

2Ki 1 :7 He said, “This man who met you and said all this, what was he like?”.

2Ki 1 :8 “A man wearing a hair cloak”, they answered, “and a leather loincloth”. “It was Elijah the Tishbite”, he said.
2Ki 1 :9 He then sent a captain of fifty soldiers with his fifty men to Elijah, whom they found sitting on top of a hill;
the captain went up to him and said, “Man of God, the king says, ‘Come down’”.

2Ki 1:10 Elijah answered the captain, “If I am a man of God, may fire fall from heaven and destroy both you and
your fifty men”. And fire fell from heaven and destroyed him and his fifty men.

2Ki 1:11 The king sent a second captain of fifty to him, again with fifty men, and he too went up and said, “Man
of God, this is the king’s order, ‘Come down at once’”.

2Ki 1:12 Elijah answered them, “If I am a man of God, may fire fall from heaven and destroy both you and your
fifty men”. And lightning fell from heaven and destroyed him and his fifty men.

2Ki 1:13 The king then sent a third captain of fifty to him, with another fifty men. The third captain of fifty came
up to Elijah, fell on his knees before him and pleaded with him. “Man of God”, he said, “may my life and the lives
of these fifty servants of yours count for something in your eyes.

2Ki 1:14 Fire has fallen from heaven and destroyed two captains of fifties and their companies, but this time
may my life count for something in your eyes!”.

2Ki 1:15 The angel of Yahweh said to Elijah, “Go down with him; do not be afraid of him”. He rose and
accompanied him down to the king,

2Ki 1:16 and said to him, “Yahweh says this, ‘Since you sent messengers to consult Baal-Zebub god of Ekron,
you will never leave the bed you have got into; you are certainly going to die’”.

2Ki 1:17 And, in accordance with the word of Yahweh which Elijah had uttered, he died. Since he had no son,
his brother Jehoram succeeded him, in the second year of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah.

2Ki 1:18 The rest of the history of Ahaziah, and his career, is this not recorded in the Book of the Annals of the
Kings of Israel?

2Ki 2:1 This is what happened when Yahweh took Elijah up to heaven in the whirlwind: Elijah and Elisha set out
from Gilgal,

2Ki 2:2 and Elijah said to Elisha, “You stay here, for Yahweh is only sending me to Bethel”. But Elisha replied,

“As Yahweh lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you!”. and they went down to Bethel.

2Ki 2:3 The brotherhood of prophets living at Bethel came out to meet Elisha and said, “Do you know that
Yahweh will carry your lord and master away today?”. “Yes, I know”, he said, “be quiet”.

2Ki 2:4 Elijah said, “Elisha, you stay here, Yahweh is only sending me to Jericho”. But he replied, “As Yahweh
lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you!”. and they went on to Jericho.



2Ki 2:5 The brotherhood of prophets living at Jericho went up to Elisha and said, “Do you know that Yahweh will
carry your lord and master away today?”. “Yes, I know”, he said, “be quiet”.

2Ki 2:6 Elijah said, “Elisha, you stay here, Yahweh is only sending me to the Jordan”. But he replied, “As Yahweh
lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you!”. And they went on together.

2Ki 2:7 Fifty of the brotherhood of prophets followed them, halting some distance away as the two of them stood
beside the Jordan.

2Ki 2:8 Elijah took his cloak, rolled it up and struck the water; and the water divided to left and right, and the two
of them crossed over dry-shod.

2Ki 2:9 When they had crossed, Elijah said to Elisha, “Make your request. What can I do for you before I am
snatched away from you?”. Elisha answered, “Let me inherit a double share of your spirit”.

2Ki 2:10 “Your request is difficult”, Elijah said. “If you see me while I am being snatched away from you, it will be
as you ask; if not, it will not be so”.

2Ki 2:11 Now as they walked on, talking as they went, a chariot of fire appeared and horses of fire coming
between the two of them; and Elijah went up to heaven in the whirlwind.

2Ki 2:12 Elisha saw it, and shouted, “My father! My father! Chariot of Israel and its chargers!”. Then he lost sight
of him, and taking hold of his own clothes he tore them in half.

2Ki 2:13 He picked up Elijah’s cloak which had fallen, and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan.

2Ki 2:14 He took Elijah’s cloak and struck the water. “Where is Yahweh, the God of Elijah?”. he cried. As he
struck the water it divided to right and left, and Elisha crossed over.

2Ki 2:15 The brotherhood of prophets saw him in the distance, and said, “The spirit of Elijah has come to rest on
Elisha”; they went to meet him and bowed to the ground before him.

2Ki 2:16 “Look”, they said, “your servants have fifty strong men with them, let them go and look for your master;
the Spirit of Yahweh may have taken him up and thrown him down on a mountain or into a valley”. “Send no one”,
he replied.

2Ki 2:17 But they so shamed him with their insistence that he consented. So they sent fifty men who searched
for three days without finding him.

2Ki 2:18 They then came back to Elisha who had stayed in Jericho; he said, “Didn’t I tell you not to go?”.

2Ki 2:19 The people of the city said to Elisha, “The city is pleasant to live in, as my lord indeed can see, but the
water is foul and the country suffers from miscarriages”.

2Ki 2:20 “Bring me a new bowl”, he said, “and put some salt in it”. They brought it to him.

2Ki 2:21 Then he went to the source of the water, threw salt into it and said, “Yahweh says this, ‘I make this
water wholesome: neither death nor miscarriage shall come from it any more’”.

2Ki 2:22 And the water became wholesome, as it is today, exactly as Elisha had said it would.

2Ki 2:23 From there he went up to Bethel, and while he was on the road, some small boys came out of the town
and jeered at him. “Hurry up, baldy!”. they shouted. “Come on up, baldy!”.

2Ki 2:24 He turned round and looked at them; and he cursed them in the name of Yahweh. And two bears came
out of the forest and savaged forty-two of the boys.

2Ki 2:25 From there he went on to Mount Carmel and then returned to Samaria.

2Ki 3:1 Jehoram son of Ahab became king of Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of
Judah, and reigned for twelve years.

2Ki 3:2 He did what is displeasing to Yahweh, though not like his father and mother, for he did away with the
pillar to Baal which his father had made.

2Ki 3:3 Nonetheless, he continued to practise the sins into which Jeroboam son of Nebat had led Israel and did
not give them up.

2Ki 3:4 Mesha king of Moab was a sheep-breeder and used to pay the king of Israel in tribute a hundred
thousand lambs and a hundred thousand rams with their wool.

2Ki 3:5 But when Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.

2Ki 3:6 At once King Jehoram left Samaria and mustered all Israel.

2Ki 3:7 After this he sent word to the king of Judah, “The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go to
war with me against Moab?”. “I will”, he replied. “I will be as you, my men as yours, my horses as yours”,

2Ki 3:8 and added, “Which way are we to attack?”. “Through the desert of Edom”, the other answered.

2Ki 3:9 So they set out, the king of Israel, the king of Judah and the king of Edom. They carried out a flanking
movement for seven days, until there was no water left for the troops or for the beasts of their baggage train.

2Ki 3:10 “Alas!”. the king of Israel exclaimed, “Yahweh has summoned us three kings, only to put us into the
power of Moab”.

2Ki 3:11 But the king of Judah said, “Is there no prophet of Yahweh here for us to consult Yahweh through him?”.
One of the king of Israel’s servants answered, “Elisha son of Shaphat is here, who used to pour water on the
hands of Elijah”.

2Ki 3:12 “The word of Yahweh is with him”, the king of Judah said. So the king of Israel, the king of Judah and



the king of Edom went to consult him.

2Ki 3:13 But Elisha said to the king of Israel, “What business have you with me? Go to your father’s and your
mother’s prophets”. “No”, the king of Israel answered, “Yahweh is the one who has summoned us three kings,
only to put us into the power of Moab”. Elisha replied,

2Ki 3:14 “By the life of Yahweh Sabaoth whom I serve, if I did not respect the king of Judah, I would take no
notice of you, nor so much as look at you.

2Ki 3:15 Now bring me someöne who can play the lyre”. And as the musician played, the hand of Yahweh came
on him

2Ki 3:16 and he said, “Yahweh says this, ‘Dig in this valley ditch after ditch’,

2Ki 3:17 for Yahweh says, ‘You will see no wind, you will see no rain, but this valley will become full of water,
and you and your troops and your baggage animals will drink’.

2Ki 3:18 But this is only a trifle in Yahweh’s eyes, for he will put Moab itself into your power.

2Ki 3:19 You will storm every fortified town, fell every productive tree, block every water-hole, ruin all the best
fields with stones”.

2Ki 3:20 Next morning at the time when the oblation was being offered, water came from the direction of Edom,
and the whole terrain was flooded.

2Ki 3:21 When the Moabites learned that the kings were advancing to fight them, all those of an age to bear
arms were mobilised; they took up position on the frontier.

2Ki 3:22 In the morning when they got up, the sun was shining on the water; and in the distance the Moabites
saw the water as red as blood.

2Ki 3:23 “This is blood!”. they said. “The kings must have fought among themselves and killed one another. So
now for the booty, Moab!”.

2Ki 3:24 But when they reached the Israelite camp, the Israelites launched their attack and the Moabites fled
before them, and as they advanced they cut the Moabites to pieces.

2Ki 3:25 They laid the towns in ruins, and each man threw a stone into all the best fields to fill them up, and they
blocked every water-hole and felled every productive tree. In the end, there was only Kir-Hareseth left, which the
slingers surrounded and bombarded.

2Ki 3:26 When the king of Moab saw that the battle had turned against him, he mustered seven hundred
swordsmen in the hope of breaking a way out and going to the king of Aram, but he failed.

2Ki 3:27 Then he took his eldest son who was to succeed him and offered him as a sacrifice on the city wall.
Alarmed at this, the Israelites withdrew and retired to their own territory.

2Ki 4:1 The wife of a member of the prophetic brotherhood appealed to Elisha. “Your servant my husband is
dead”, she said, “and you know how your servant revered Yahweh. A creditor has now come to take my two
children and make them his slaves”.

2Ki 4:2 Elisha said, “What can I do for you? Tell me, what have you got in the house?”. “Your servant has nothing
in the house”, she replied, “except a flask of oil”.

2Ki 4:3 Then he said, “Go outside and borrow jars from all your neighbours, empty jars and not too few.

2Ki 4:4 When you come back, shut the door on yourself and your sons, and pour the oil into all these jars,
putting each aside when it is full”.

2Ki 4:5 So she left him; and she shut the door on herself and her sons; they passed her the jars and she went
on pouring.

2Ki 4:6 When the jars were full, she said to her son, “Pass me another jar”. “There are no more”, he replied. Then
the oil stopped flowing.

2Ki 4:7 She went and told the man of God, who said, “Go and sell the oil and redeem your pledge; you and your
children can live on the remainder”.

2Ki 4:8 One day as Elisha was on his way to Shunem, a woman of rank who lived there pressed him to stay and
eat there. After this he always broke his journey for a meal when he passed that way.

2Ki 4:9 She said to her husband, “Look, I am sure the man who is constantly passing our way must be a holy
man of God.

2Ki 4:10 Let us build him a small walled room, and put him a bed in it, and a table and chair and lamp;
whenever he comes to us he can rest there”.

2Ki 4:1 1 One day when he came, he retired to the upper room and lay down.

2Ki 4:12 He said to his servant Gehazi, “Call our Shunammite”. He called her and when she appeared, Elisha
said,

2Ki 4:13 “Tell her this: ‘Look, you have gone to all this trouble for us, what can we do for you? Is there anything
you would like said for you to the king or to the commander of the army?’”. But she replied, “I live with my own
people about me”.

2Ki 4:14 “What can I do for you then?”. he asked. Gehazi replied, “Well, she has no son and her husband is old”.
2Ki 4:15 Elisha said, “Call her”. The servant called her and she stood at the door.



2Ki 4:16 “This time next year”, he said, “you will hold a son in your arms”. But she said, “No, my lord, do not
deceive your servant”.

2Ki 4:17 But the woman did conceive, and she gave birth to a son at the time that Elisha had said she would.

2Ki 4:18 The child grew up; one day he went to his father who was with the reapers,

2Ki 4:19 and exclaimed to his father, “Oh, my head! My head!”. The father told a servant to carry him to his
mother.

2Ki 4:20 He lifted him up and took him to his mother, and the boy lay on her lap until midday, when he died.

2Ki 4:21 She went upstairs, laid him on the bed of the man of God, shut the door on him and went out.

2Ki 4:22 She called her husband and said, “Send me one of the servants with a donkey. I must hurry to the man
of God and back”.

2Ki 4:23 “Why go to him today?”. he asked. “It is not New Moon or Sabbath”. But she replied, “Never mind”.

2Ki 4:24 She had the donkey saddled and said to her servant, “Lead on, go! Do not draw rein until I give the
order”.

2Ki 4:25 She set off and made her way to the man of God at Mount Carmel. When the man of God saw her in
the distance, he said to his servant Gehazi, “Look, here comes our Shunammite!

2Ki 4:26 Now run and meet her and ask her, ‘Are you well? Is your husband well? Your child well?’”. “Yes”, she
replied.

2Ki 4:27 When she came to the man of God there on the mountain, she took hold of his feet. Gehazi stepped
forward to push her away, but the man of God said, “Leave her; there is bitterness in her soul and Yahweh has
hidden it from me, he has not told me”.

2Ki 4:28 She said, “Did I ask my lord for a son? Did I not say: Don’t deceive me?”.

2Ki 4:29 Elisha said to Gehazi, “Hitch up your clothes, take my staff in your hand and go. If you meet anyone, do
not greet him; if anyone greets you, do not answer him. You are to stretch out my staff over the child”.

2Ki 4:30 But the child’s mother said, “As Yahweh lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you”. Then he
stood up and followed her.

2Ki 4:31 Gehazi had gone ahead of them and had stretched out the staff over the child, but there was no sound
or response. He went back to meet Elisha and told him. “The child has not woken up”, he said.

2Ki 4:32 Elisha then went to the house, and there on his bed lay the child, dead.

2Ki 4:33 He went in and shut the door on the two of them and prayed to Yahweh.

2Ki 4:34 Then he climbed on to the bed and stretched himself on top of the child, putting his mouth on his
mouth, his eyes to his eyes, and his hands on his hands, and as he lowered himself on to him, the child’s flesh
grew warm.

2Ki 4:35 Then he got up and walked to and fro inside the house, and then climbed on to the bed again and
lowered himself on to the child seven times in all; then the child sneezed and opened his eyes.

2Ki 4:36 He then summoned Gehazi. “Call our Shunammite”, he said. He called her. When she came to him, he
said, “Pick up your son”.

2Ki 4:37 She went in and, falling at his feet, prostrated herself on the floor and then picked up her son and went
out.

2Ki 4:38 Elisha went back to Gilgal while there was famine in the country. As the brotherhood of prophets were
sitting with him, he said to his servant, “Put the large pot on the fire and cook some soup for the brotherhood”.

2Ki 4:39 One of them went into the fields to gather herbs and came on some wild vine, off which he gathered
enough gourds to fill his lap. On his return, he cut them up into the pot of soup; they did not know what they
were.

2Ki 4:40 They then poured the soup out for the men to eat, but they had no sooner tasted the soup than they
cried, “Man of God, there is death in the pot!”. And they could not eat it.

2Ki 4:41 “Bring some meal then”, Elisha said. This he threw into the pot, and said, “Pour out, for the company to
eat!”. And there was nothing harmful in the pot.

2Ki 4:42 A man came from Baal-Shalishah, bringing the man of God bread from the first-fruits, twenty barley
loaves and fresh grain still in the husk. “Give it to the company to eat”, Elisha said.

2Ki 4:43 But his servant replied, “How can I serve this to a hundred men?”. “Give it to the company to eat”, he
insisted, “for Yahweh says this, ‘They will eat and have some left over’”.

2Ki 4:44 He served them; they ate and had some left over, as Yahweh had said.

2Ki 5:1 Naaman, army commander to the king of Aram, was a man who enjoyed his master’s respect and
favour, since through him Yahweh had granted victory to the Aramaeans.

2Ki 5:2 But the man suffered from a virulent skin-disease. Now, on one of their raids into Israelite territory, the
Aramaeans had carried off a little girl, who became a servant of Naaman’s wife.

2Ki 5:3 She said to her mistress, “If only my master would approach the prophet of Samaria! He would cure him
of his skin-disease”.

2Ki 5:4 Naaman went and told his master. “This and this”, he reported, “is what the girl from Israel has said”.



2Ki 5:5 “Go by all means”, said the king of Aram, “I shall send a letter to the king of Israel”. So Naaman left,
taking with him ten talants of silver, six thousand shekels of gold and ten festal robes.

2Ki 5:6 He presented the letter to the king of Israel. It read, “With this letter, I am sending my servant Naaman to
you for you to cure him of his skin-disease”.

2Ki 5:7 When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes. “Am I a god to give death and life”, he said,

“for him to send a man to me and ask me to cure him of his skin-disease? Listen to this and take note of it and
see how he intends to pick a quarrel with me”.

2Ki 5:8 When Elisha heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent word to the king, “Why have you
torn your clothes? Let him come to me, and he will find there is a prophet in Israel”.

2Ki 5:9 So Naaman came with his team and chariot and drew up at the door of Elisha’s house.

2Ki 5:10 And Elisha sent him a messenger to say, “Go and bathe seven times in the Jordan, and your flesh will
become clean once more”.

2Ki 5:1 1 But Naaman was indignant and went off, saying, “Here was I, thinking he would be sure to come out to
me, and stand there, and call on the name of Yahweh his God, and wave his hand over the spot and cure the
part that was diseased.

2Ki 5:12 Surely, Abana and Parpar, the rivers of Damascus, are better than any water in Israel? Could I not
bathe in them and become clean?”. And he turned round and went off in a rage.

2Ki 5:13 But his servants approached him and said, “Father, if the prophet had asked you to do something
difficult, would you not have done it? All the more reason, then, when he says to you, ‘Bathe, and you will
become clean’”.

2Ki 5:14 So he went down and immersed himself seven times in the Jordan, as Elisha had told him to do. And
his flesh became clean once more like the flesh of a little child.

2Ki 5:15 Returning to Elisha with his whole escort, he went in and, presenting himself, said, “Now I know that
there is no God anywhere on earth except in Israel. Now, please, accept a present from your servant”.

2Ki 5:16 But Elisha replied, “As Yahweh lives, whom I serve, I will accept nothing”. Naaman pressed him to
accept, but he refused.

2Ki 5:17 Then Naaman said, “Since your answer is ‘No’, allow your servant to be given as much earth as two
mules may carry, since your servant will no longer make burnt offerings or sacrifice to any god except Yahweh.
2Ki 5:18 Only — and may Yahweh forgive your servant for this — when my master goes to the temple of Rimmon
to worship there, he leans on my arm, and I bow down in the temple of Rimmon when he does; may Yahweh
forgive your servant for doing this!”.

2Ki 5:19 “Go in peace”, Elisha replied.

2Ki 5:20 Naaman had gone a small distance, when Gehazi, Elisha’s servant, said to himself, “My master has let
this Aramaean Naaman off lightly, by not accepting what he offered. As Yahweh lives, I will run after him and get
something out of him”.

2Ki 5:21 So Gehazi set off in pursuit of Naaman. When Naaman saw him running after him, he jumped down
from his chariot to meet him. “Is all well?”. he asked.

2Ki 5:22 “All is well”, he said. “My master has sent me to say, ‘This very moment two young men of the prophetic
brotherhood have arrived from the highlands of Ephraim. Be kind enough to give them a talant of silver and two
festal robes’”.

2Ki 5:23 “Please accept two talants”, Naaman replied, and pressed him, tying up the two talants of silver in two
bags with the two festal robes and consigning them to two of his servants who carried them ahead of Gehazi.

2Ki 5:24 When he reached Ophel, he took these from them and put them away in the house. He then dismissed
the men, who went away.

2Ki 5:25 He, for his part, went and presented himself to his master. Elisha said, “Gehazi, where have you been?”.
“Your servant has not been anywhere”, he replied.

2Ki 5:26 But Elisha said to him, “Was not my heart present there when someöne left his chariot to meet you?
Now you have taken the money, you can buy gardens with it, and olive groves, sheep and oxen, male and
female slaves.

2Ki 5:27 But Naaman’s disease of the skin will cling to you and your descendants for ever”. And Gehazi left his
presence white as snow from skin-disease.

2Ki 6:1 The brotherhood of prophets said to Elisha, “Look, the place where we are living with you is too small for
us.

2Ki 6:2 Let us go to the Jordan, then, and each of us cut a beam there, and we will make our living quarters
there”. He replied, “Go”.

2Ki 6:3 “Be good enough to go with your servants”, one of them said. “I will go”, he replied,

2Ki 6:4 and went with them. On reaching the Jordan they began cutting down timber.

2Ki 6:5 But, as one of them was felling his beam, the iron axehead fell into the water. “Alas, my lord”, he
exclaimed, “and it was a borrowed one too!”.



2Ki 6:6 “Where did it fall?”. the man of God asked; and he showed him the spot. Then, cutting a stick, Elisha
threw it in at that point and made the iron axehead float.

2Ki 6:7 “Lift it out”, he said; and the man stretched out his hand and took it.

2Ki 6:8 The king of Aram was at war with Israel. He conferred with his officers and said, “You must attack at
such and such a place”.

2Ki 6:9 Elisha, however, sent word to the king of Israel, “Be on your guard about such and such a place,
because the Aramaeans are going to attack it”.

2Ki 6:10 The king of Israel accordingly sent men to the place which Elisha had named. And he kept warning the
king, and the king stayed on the alert; and this happened more than once or twice.

2Ki 6:11 The king of Aram grew very much disturbed over this. He summoned his officers, and said, “Tell me
which of you is betraying us to the king of Israel”.

2Ki 6:12 “No one, my lord king”, one of his officers replied. “It is Elisha, the prophet in Israel. The words you utter
in your bedchamber, he reveals to the king of Israel”.

2Ki 6:13 “Go and find out where he is”, the king said, “so that I can send people to capture him”. Word was
brought to him, “He is now in Dothan”.

2Ki 6:14 So he sent horses and chariots there, and a large force; and these, arriving during the night,
surrounded the town.

2Ki 6:15 Next day, Elisha got up early and went out; and there surrounding the town was an armed force with
horses and chariots. “Oh, my lord”, his servant said, “what are we to do?”.

2Ki 6:16 “Do not be afraid”, he replied, “for there are more on our side than on theirs”.

2Ki 6:17 And Elisha prayed. “Yahweh”, he said, “open his eyes and make him see”. Yahweh opened the
servant’s eyes, and he saw the mountain covered in fiery horses and chariots surrounding Elisha.

2Ki 6:18 As the Aramaeans came down towards him, Elisha prayed to Yahweh, “I beg you to strike these people
sun-blind”. And, at Elisha’s word, he struck them sun-blind.

2Ki 6:19 Then Elisha said to them, “This is not the road, nor is this the town. Follow me; I shall lead you to the
man you are looking for”. But he led them to Samaria.

2Ki 6:20 As they entered Samaria, Elisha said, “Yahweh, open these people’s eyes, and let them see”. Yahweh
opened their eyes and they saw; they were inside Samaria.

2Ki 6:21 When the king of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha, “Shall I kill them, father?”.

2Ki 6:22 “Do not kill them”, he replied. “Do you kill your own prisoners with sword and bow? Offer them food and
water, so that they can eat and drink, and then let them go back to their master”.

2Ki 6:23 So the king provided a great feast for them; and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them off and
they went back to their master. Aramaean raiding parties never invaded the territory of Israel again.

2Ki 6:24 It happened after this that Ben-Hadad king of Aram, mustering his whole army, marched on and laid
siege to Samaria.

2Ki 6:25 In Samaria there was great famine, and so strict was the siege that the head of a donkey sold for
eighty shekels of silver, and one quarter-kab of wild onions for five shekels of silver.

2Ki 6:26 Now as the king was passing along the city wall, a woman shouted, “Help, my lord king!”.

2Ki 6:27 “If Yahweh does not help you”, he retorted, “where can I find help for you? From the threshing-floor?
From the winepress?”.

2Ki 6:28 Then the king asked, “What is the matter?”. “This woman here”, she answered, “said to me, ‘Give up
your son; we will eat him today, and eat my son tomorrow’.

2Ki 6:29 So we cooked my son and ate him. Next day, I said to her, ‘Give up your son for us to eat’. But she
has hidden her son”.

2Ki 6:30 On hearing the woman’s words, the king tore his clothes; the king was walking on the wall, and the
people saw that underneath he was wearing sackcloth next his body.

2Ki 6:31 “May God bring unnameable ills on me, and worse ills, too”, he said, “if the head of Elisha son of
Shaphat remains on his shoulders today!”.

2Ki 6:32 Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. The king sent a messenger ahead
but, before the man arrived, Elisha had said to the elders, “Do you see how this son of a murderer has given
orders to cut off my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door; hold the door against him. Isn’t that
the sound of his master’s step behind him?”.

2Ki 6:33 He was still actually speaking, when the king arrived and said, “This misery plainly comes from
Yahweh. Why should I still trust in Yahweh?”.

2Ki 7:1 “Listen to the word of Yahweh”, Elisha said. “Yahweh says this, ‘By this time tomorrow a measure of
finest flour will sell for one shekel, and two measures of barley for one shekel, at the gate of Samaria’”.

2Ki 7:2 The equerry on whose arm the king was leaning retorted to Elisha, “Even if Yahweh made windows in
the sky, could this word come true?”. “You will see it with your own eyes”, Elisha replied, “though you will eat none
of it”.



2Ki 7:3 Now at the entrance to the gate — for they were afflicted with virulent skin-disease — there were four
men and they debated among themselves, “Why sit here waiting for death?

2Ki 7:4 If we decide to go into the city, what with the famine in it, we shall die there; if we stay where we are, we
shall die just the same. Come on, let us go over to the Aramaean camp; if they spare our lives, we live; if they kill
us, well, then we die”.

2Ki 7:5 So at dusk they set out and made for the Aramaean camp, but when they reached the confines of the
camp there was not a soul there.

2Ki 7:6 For Yahweh had caused the Aramaeans in their camp to hear a noise of chariots and horses, the noise
of a great army; and they had said to one another, “Listen! The king of Israel has hired the Hittite and Egyptian
kings against us, to attack us”.

2Ki 7:7 So in the dusk they had made off and fled, abandoning their tents, their horses and their donkeys;
leaving the camp just as it was, they had fled for their lives.

2Ki 7:8 The men with skin-disease, then, reached the confines of the camp. They went into one of the tents and
ate and drank, and from it carried off silver and gold and clothing; these they took and hid. Then they came back
and, entering another tent, looted it too, and took and hid their booty.

2Ki 7:9 Then they said to one another, “We are doing wrong. This is a day of good news, yet we are holding our
tongues! If we wait till morning, we shall certainly be punished. Come on, let us go and take the news to the
palace”.

2Ki 7:10 Off they went and shouted out to the guards on the city gate, “We have been to the Aramaean camp.
There was not a soul there, no sound of anyone, only tethered horses and tethered donkeys, and their tents just
as they were”.

2Ki 7:1 1 The gatekeepers shouted the news, which was reported inside the palace.

2Ki 7:12 The king got up while it was still dark and said to his officers, “I can tell you what the Aramaeans have
done to us. They know we are starving, so they have left the camp to hide in the open country. ‘They will come
out of the city’, they think, ‘we shall catch them alive and get into the city’”.

2Ki 7:13 One of his officers replied, “Five of the surviving horses still left us had better be taken — they would die
in any case like all the rest. Let us send them and see”.

2Ki 7:14 So they took two chariot teams and the king sent them after the Aramaean army, saying, “Go and see”.
2Ki 7:15 They followed them as far as the Jordan, finding the whole way strewn with clothes and gear which the
Aramaeans had thrown away in their panic. The scouts returned and informed the king.

2Ki 7:16 Then the people went out and plundered the Aramaean camp: a measure of finest flour sold for one
shekel, and two measures of barley for one shekel, as Yahweh had promised they would.

2Ki 7:17 The king had detailed the equerry, on whose arm he leaned, as commander of the guard on the gate,
but the people trampled on him in the gateway and he died, as the man of God had foretold when the king had
come down to him.

2Ki 7:18 (What Elisha had said to the king came true, “Two measures of barley will sell for one shekel, and a
measure of finest flour for one shekel, by this time tomorrow at the gate of Samaria”.

2Ki 7:19 And the equerry in question had replied to the man of God, “Even if Yahweh made windows in the sky,
could this word come true?”. “You will see it with your own eyes”, Elisha had answered, “though you will eat none
of it”.

2Ki 7:20 And that was what happened to him: for the people trampled on him in the gateway and he died.)

2Ki 8:1 Elisha had said to the woman whose son he had raised to life, “Move away with your family, and live
where you can in some foreign country, for Yahweh has called up a famine — it is already coming on the country
— for seven years”.

2Ki 8:2 The woman hurried to do what the man of God had told her: she set out, she and her family, and for
seven years she lived in Philistine territory.

2Ki 8:3 When the seven years were over, the woman returned from Philistine territory and went to lodge a claim
with the king for her house and land.

2Ki 8:4 Now the king was talking to Gehazi, the servant of the man of God. “Tell me”, he was saying, “all about
the marvels which Elisha did”.

2Ki 8:5 Gehazi was just telling the king how Elisha had raised the dead child to life, when the woman whose son
Elisha had raised lodged her claim with the king for her house and land. “My lord king”, Gehazi said, “this is the
very woman, and that is her son whom Elisha raised to life”.

2Ki 8:6 The king questioned the woman, who told him the story. The king then delegated one of the officials to
her with this order, “See that all her property is restored to her, and all the revenue from her land from the day
she left the country until now”.

2Ki 8:7 Elisha went to Damascus. Ben-Hadad king of Aram was ill, and was told, “The man of God has come all
the way to us”.

2Ki 8:8 Then the king said to Hazael, “Take a present with you and go and meet the man of God; consult



Yahweh through him, and find out if I shall recover from my illness”.

2Ki 8:9 So Hazael went to meet Elisha, taking with him as a present the best that Damascus could offer, a load
for forty camels. He arrived and, presenting himself, said, “Your son Ben-Hadad king of Aram has sent me to ask
you, ‘Shall I recover from my illness?’”.

2Ki 8:10 Elisha replied, “Go and tell him, ‘You might recover’, though Yahweh has shown me that he will
certainly die”.

2Ki 8:1 1 Then the face of the man of God went rigid, and his look grew strangely fixed, and he wept.

2Ki 8:12 “Why”, Hazael asked, “does my lord weep?”. “Because I know”, Elisha replied, “what harm you will do to
the Israelites: you will burn down their fortresses, put their picked warriors to the sword, dash their little children
to pieces, disembowel their pregnant women”.

2Ki 8:13 “But what is your servant?”. Hazael said. “How could this dog achieve anything so great?”. “In a vision
from Yahweh”, Elisha replied, “I have seen you king of Aram”.

2Ki 8:14 Leaving Elisha, Hazael went back to his master who asked, “What did Elisha say to you?”. He replied,
“He told me that you might recover”.

2Ki 8:15 Next day he took a blanket, soaked it in water, and spread it over his face. So died Ben-Hadad, and
Hazael succeeded him.

2Ki 8:16 In the fifth year of Jehoram son of Ahab, king of Israel, Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat became king of
Judah.

2Ki 8:17 He was thirty-two years old when he came to the throne, and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem.
2Ki 8:18 He followed the example of the kings of Israel as the House of Ahab were doing; he had married one of
Ahab’s daughters; and he did what is displeasing to Yahweh.

2Ki 8:19 But Yahweh was unwilling to destroy Judah, because of his servant David, and was faithful to the
promise which he had made him to leave him a lamp for ever in his presence.

2Ki 8:20 In his time Edom threw off the domination of Judah and set up a king for itself.

2Ki 8:21 Jehoram crossed to Zair, and with him all the chariots … Under cover of dark, he and his chariot
commanders broke through the Edomites surrounding him; the people fled to their tents.

2Ki 8:22 Even so, Edom threw off the domination of Judah, remaining free to the present day. Libnah also
revolted at that time.

2Ki 8:23 The rest of the history of Jehoram, his entire career, is this not recorded in the Book of the Annals of
the Kings of Judah?

2Ki 8:24 Then Jehoram fell asleep with his ancestors and was buried with them in the City of David; his son
Ahaziah succeeded him.

2Ki 8:25 In the twelfth year of Jehoram son of Ahab, king of Israel, Ahaziah son of Jehoram, king of Judah,
became king.

2Ki 8:26 Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he came to the throne, and he reigned for one year in
Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athaliah granddaughter of Omri king of Israel.

2Ki 8:27 He followed the example of the House of Ahab and did what is displeasing to Yahweh, as the House of
Ahab were doing, to whom he was related by marriage.

2Ki 8:28 He went with Jehoram son of Ahab to make war on Hazael king of Aram at Ramoth in Gilead, but the
Aramaeans wounded Jehoram.

2Ki 8:29 King Jehoram returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds which he had received at Ramah,
fighting against Hazael king of Aram. Ahaziah son of Jehoram, king of Judah, went down to Jezreel to visit
Jehoram son of Ahab because he was ailing.

2Ki 9:1 The prophet Elisha summoned a member of the prophetic brotherhood to him, “Hitch up your clothes,
take this flask of oil, and go to Ramoth in Gilead.

2Ki 9:2 When you arrive there, look for Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, son of Nimshi. Then, when you find him, tell
him to get up and leave his companions, and take him into an inner room.

2Ki 9:3 Take the flask of oil then and pour it over his head, and say, ‘Yahweh says this: I have anointed you
king of Israel’. Then open the door and flee as fast as you can”.

2Ki 9:4 The young man left for Ramoth in Gilead

2Ki 9:5 and when he arrived, found the senior officers of the army sitting together. “I have a message for you,
commander”, he said. “For which of us?”. asked Jehu. “For you, commander”, he answered.

2Ki 9:6 Jehu then got up and went into the house. And the young man poured the oil on his head, saying,
“Yahweh, God of Israel, says this, ‘I have anointed you king of Yahweh’s people, of Israel.

2Ki 9:7 You will strike down the family of Ahab your master, and I shall avenge the blood of my servants the
prophets and all of Yahweh’s servants, on Jezebel

2Ki 9:8 and on the whole family of Ahab. I shall destroy every manjack of Ahab’s family, fettered or free in Israel.
2Ki 9:9 I shall make the House of Ahab like the House of Jeroboam son of Nebat and of Baasha son of Ahijah.
2Ki 9:10 As for Jezebel, the dogs will eat her in the field of Jezreel; no one will bury her’”. With this, he opened



the door and made his escape.

2Ki 9:1 1 Jehu came out to his master’s officers. “Is all well?”. they asked him. “Why did this madman come to
you?”. “You know the fellow and how he talks”, he answered.

2Ki 9:12 “Evasion!”. they cried, “Come on, tell us”. He replied, “He said this and that to me. He said, ‘Yahweh says
this: I have anointed you king of Israel’”.

2Ki 9:13 Whereüpon they all took their cloaks and spread them under him on the bare steps; they sounded the
trumpet and shouted, “Jehu is king!”.

2Ki 9:14 Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, son of Nimshi plotted against Jehoram. (At the time, Jehoram, with all Israel,
was holding Ramoth in Gilead against an attack by Hazael king of Aram,

2Ki 9:15 but King Jehoram had gone back to Jezreel to recover from the wounds which he had received from
the Aramaeans while he was fighting against Hazael king of Aram.) “If you agree”, Jehu said, “let no one leave
the town to go and take the news to Jezreel”.

2Ki 9:16 Jehu then mounted his chariot and left for Jezreel; Jehoram had taken to his bed there, and Ahaziah
king of Judah had gone down to visit him.

2Ki 9:17 The lookout posted on the tower of Jezreel saw Jehu’s troop approaching. “I can see a body of men”,
he shouted. Jehoram gave the order: “Have a horseman sent to meet them and ask, ‘Is all well?’”.

2Ki 9:18 The horseman went to meet Jehu and said, “The king says, ‘Is all well?’”. “What has it to do with you
whether all is well?”. Jehu replied. “Fall in behind me”. The lookout reported, “The messenger has reached them
and is not coming back”.

2Ki 9:19 The king sent a second horseman who reached them and said, “The king says, ‘Is all well?’”. “What has
it to do with you whether all is well?”. Jehu replied. “Fall in behind me”.

2Ki 9:20 The lookout reported, “He has reached them and is not coming back. The manner of driving is like that
of Jehu son of Nimshi: he drives like a madman”.

2Ki 9:21 “Harness!”. Jehoram cried; and they harnessed his chariot. Then Jehoram king of Israel and Ahaziah
king of Judah, each in his chariot, set out to meet Jehu. They reached him in the field of Naboth of Jezreel.

2Ki 9:22 As soon as Jehoram saw Jehu he asked, “Is all well, Jehu?”. “What a question!”. he replied, “when all the
while the prostitutions and countless sorceries of your mother Jezebel go on”.

2Ki 9:23 At this, Jehoram wheeled and fled, saying to Ahaziah, “Treason, Ahaziah!”.

2Ki 9:24 But Jehu had drawn his bow; he struck Jehoram between the shoulder-blades, the arrow went through
the king’s heart, and he sank down in his chariot.

2Ki 9:25 “Pick him up”, Jehu said to Bidkar, his equerry, “and throw him into the field of Naboth of Jezreel.
Remember how, when you and I manned a chariot together behind Ahab his father, Yahweh pronounced this
sentence against him,

2Ki 9:26 ‘This I swear. Yesterday I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons — Yahweh says this. And
in this same field I shall requite you — Yahweh says this’. So pick him up, and throw him into the field, as
Yahweh declared should happen!”.

2Ki 9:27 When Ahaziah king of Judah saw this, he fled along the Beth-ha-Gan road, but Jehu went in pursuit of
him. “Strike him down too”, he said. And they wounded him in his chariot at the slope of Gur, which is near
Ibleam, and he took refuge in Megiddo, where he died.

2Ki 9:28 His servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem and buried him in his tomb in the City of David.

2Ki 9:29 Ahaziah had become king of Judah in the eleventh year of Jehoram son of Ahab.

2Ki 9:30 When Jehu went back to Jezreel, Jezebel was told. She made up her eyes with mascara, adorned her
head and appeared at the window.

2Ki 9:31 As Jehu came through the gateway she said, “How did Zimri get on after killing his master?”.

2Ki 9:32 Jehu looked up to the window and said, “Who is on my side? Who?”. And two or three officials looked
down at him.

2Ki 9:33 “Throw her down”, he said. They threw her down and her blood spattered the walls and the horses; and
Jehu rode over her.

2Ki 9:34 He went in and ate and drank, then said, “See to this accursed woman, and give her burial; after all,
she was a king’s daughter”.

2Ki 9:35 But when they went to bury her, they found nothing but her skull, feet and hands.

2Ki 9:36 They came back and told Jehu, who said, “This is the word of Yahweh which he spoke through his
servant Elijah the Tishbite, ‘The dogs will eat the flesh of Jezebel in the field of Jezreel;

2Ki 9:37 the corpse of Jezebel will be like dung spread on the fields, so that no one will be able to say: This was
Jezebel’”.

2Ki 10:1 There were seventy of Ahab’s sons in Samaria. Jehu sent to Samaria, to the authorities of the city, to
the elders and to the guardians of Ahab’s children. He said,

2Ki 10:2 “Now, when this letter reaches you, you have your master’s sons with you; you also have chariots and
horses, a fortified city and weapons.



2Ki 10:3 See which of your master’s sons is the best and worthiest, put him on his father’s throne and fight for
your master’s dynasty!”.

2Ki 10:4 They were utterly terrified. “We have seen how the two kings could not stand up to him”, they said, “so
how could we?”.

2Ki 10:5 Consequently the master of the palace, the governor of the city, the elders and the guardians sent
word to Jehu, “We are your servants. We shall do whatever you order us. We shall not proclaim a king; act as
you think best”.

2Ki 10:6 Jehu then wrote them a second letter. He said, “If you are for me and if you are prepared to accept
orders from me, take the heads of the men of your master’s family and come to me at Jezreel by this time
tomorrow”. (There were seventy of Ahab’s sons being educated there by the leading men of the city.)

2Ki 10:7 When this letter reached them, they took the king’s sons and butchered all seventy of them, put their
heads in baskets and sent them to him at Jezreel.

2Ki 10:8 The messenger came and told Jehu, “They have brought the heads of the king’s sons”. “Leave them in
two heaps at the entrance to the gate until morning”, he replied.

2Ki 10:9 When morning came, he went out and, standing, said to all the people, “No guilt attaches to you! I did
indeed plot against my master and have killed him; but what about all these? Who struck them?

2Ki 10:10 Know, then, that nothing will fail to be fulfilled of the prophecy uttered by Yahweh against the House
of Ahab; Yahweh has done what he said through his servant Elijah”.

2Ki 10:11 Jehu then killed every member of the House of Ahab surviving in Jezreel, all his leading men, his
close friends, his priests; he did not leave a single one alive.

2Ki 10:12 Jehu then set out for Samaria. As he was on his way, at Beth-Eked of the Shepherds,

2Ki 10:13 he met the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah. “Who are you?”. he asked. “We are Ahaziah’s brothers”,
they replied, “and we are on our way to pay our respects to the king’s sons and the queen mother’s sons”.

2Ki 10:14 “Take them alive”, he said. They took them alive, and he slaughtered them at the storage-well of Beth-
Eked, forty-two of them; he did not spare a single one.

2Ki 10:15 Leaving there, he came on Jehonadab son of Rechab who was on his way to meet him. He greeted
him and said, “Is your heart true to mine, as my heart is to yours?”. Jehonadab replied, “Yes”. “If so”, Jehu said,
“give me your hand”. Jehonadab gave him his hand, and Jehu took him up beside him in his chariot.

2Ki 10:16 “Come with me”, he said, “and witness my zeal for Yahweh”, and took him along in his chariot.

2Ki 10:17 When he entered Samaria, he killed all the survivors of Ahab’s family there; he destroyed it, as
Yahweh had told Elijah it would happen.

2Ki 10:18 Then Jehu assembled all the people. “Ahab did Baal some small service”, he said, “but Jehu will do
him a great one.

2Ki 10:19 Now call me all the prophets of Baal and all his priests. Not one is to be absent: I have a great
sacrifice to offer to Baal. If anyone is absent, he will forfeit his life”. This was a trick on Jehu’s part to destroy the
devotees of Baal.

2Ki 10:20 “Summon a sacred assembly for Baal”, he commanded; and they summoned it.

2Ki 10:21 Jehu sent messengers throughout Israel, and all the devotees of Baal arrived, not a man was left who
did not attend. They crowded into the temple of Baal until it was full from wall to wall.

2Ki 10:22 Jehu then said to the keeper of the wardrobe, “Bring out vestments for all the devotees of Baal”; he
brought out the vestments for them.

2Ki 10:23 Jehu then went into the temple of Baal with Jehonadab son of Rechab and said to Baal’s devotees,
“Make quite sure that there are no devotees of Yahweh in here with you, but only devotees of Baal”.

2Ki 10:24 He then proceeded to present sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had stationed eighty of his
men outside, having said, “Whoëver lets one of the people go whom I am now putting within your clutches, will
pay for it with his life”.

2Ki 10:25 When he had finished making the burnt offering, he gave the order to the guards and equerries, “Go
in, strike them down! Let no one out!”. The guards and equerries went in, putting everyone to the sword all the
way to the sanctuary of Baal’s temple.

2Ki 10:26 They took the sacred pole out of Baal’s temple and burned it.

2Ki 10:27 They demolished Baal’s image and demolished Baal’s temple too, making it into a latrine, which it still
is today.

2Ki 10:28 Thus Jehu rid Israel of Baal.

2Ki 10:29 Even so, Jehu did not give up the sins into which Jeroboam son of Nebat had led Israel, the golden
calves of Bethel and Dan.

2Ki 10:30 Yahweh said to Jehu, “Since you have done well in carrying out what pleases me, and have done
everything I required to be done to the House of Ahab, your sons will occupy the throne of Israel down to the
fourth generation”.

2Ki 10:31 Jehu, however, did not faithfully and wholeheartedly follow the law of Yahweh, God of Israel; he did



not give up the sins into which Jeroboam son of Nebat had led Israel.

2Ki 10:32 At that time Yahweh began to whittle Israel down, and Hazael defeated the Israelites throughout the
territory east of the Jordan:

2Ki 10:33 the whole territory of Gilead - of the Gadites, the Reubenites and the Manassehites — from Aroer on
the River Arnon: Gilead and Bashan.

2Ki 10:34 The rest of the history of Jehu, his entire career, all his prowess, is this not recorded in the Book of
the Annals of the Kings of Israel?

2Ki 10:35 Then he fell asleep with his ancestors and was buried in Samaria; his son Jehoahaz succeeded him.
2Ki 10:36 Jehu’s reign over Israel in Samaria lasted twenty-eight years.

2Ki 11:1 When Athaliah mother of Ahaziah learned that her son was dead, she promptly murdered all those of
royal stock.

2Ki 1 1 :2 But Jehosheba, daughter of King Jehoram and sister of Ahaziah, surreptitiously rescued Jehoash son
of Ahaziah from among the princes who were to be murdered, and put him with his nurse in the sleeping
quarters; in this way she hid him from Athaliah, and he was not killed.

2Ki 11:3 He stayed, hidden with her in the Temple of Yahweh for six years, while Athaliah governed the country.
2Ki 11:4 In the seventh year, Jehoiada sent for the regimental commanders of the Carians and the guards, and
had them brought to him in the Temple of Yahweh. He made a pact with them, put them on oath, then showed
them the king’s son. He gave them this order,

2Ki 1 1 :5 “This is what you must do: a third of you who come on duty on the Sabbath must mount guard at the
royal palace,

2Ki 11:6

2Ki 1 1 :7 and your two other sections who come off duty on the Sabbath and mount guard at the Temple of
Yahweh

2Ki 1 1 :8 must surround the king, each man with his weapons in his hand; anyone forcing his way through the
ranks is to be killed. And you will escort the king as he leaves and as he comes in”.

2Ki 11:9 The regimental commanders did everything as Jehoiada the priest had ordered, and each one brought
his men, those coming on duty on the Sabbath and those going off duty on the Sabbath, and reported to
Jehoiada the priest.

2Ki 11:10 The priest then issued the regimental commanders with King David’s spears and shields, which were
kept in the Temple of Yahweh.

2Ki 11:11 The guards then took position, each man with his weapons in his hand, from the south corner of the
Temple to the north corner of the Temple, all round the altar and the Temple.

2Ki 11:12 Then Jehoiada brought the king’s son out — crowned him and gave him a copy of the covenant; and
they made him king and anointed him, and they clapped their hands and shouted, “Long live the king!”.

2Ki 11:13 On hearing the people shouting, Athaliah joined the people in the Temple of Yahweh.

2Ki 11:14 When she looked, there stood the king on a dais, as the custom was, with the officers and trumpeters
at the king’s side, and all the people of the country rejoicing and blowing the trumpets; then Athaliah tore her
clothes and shouted, “Treason, treason!”.

2Ki 11:15 Jehoiada the priest then gave the orders to the commanders in charge of the troops, “Take her out
under guard and put to death anyone who follows her”. “For”, the priest had already said, “she must not be killed
inside the Temple of Yahweh”.

2Ki 11:16 They seized her, and when she reached the horses’ entry to the palace, she was killed there.

2Ki 11:17 Jehoiada made a covenant between Yahweh, the king and the people that they would remain
Yahweh’s people; and another one between the king and the people.

2Ki 11:18 All the people of the country then went to the temple of Baal and demolished it; they smashed its
altars and its images and killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars. The priest made arrangements for
the security of the Temple of Yahweh.

2Ki 11:19 He then took the regimental commanders, the Carians, the guards and all the people of the country,
and they escorted the king down from the Temple of Yahweh, entering the palace through the Gate of the
Guards. Jehoash took his seat on the throne of the kings.

2Ki 1 1 :20 All the people of the country were delighted; the city, however, made no move. And Athaliah was put
to death inside the palace.

2Ki 12:1 Jehoash was seven years old when he came to the throne.

2Ki 12:2 Jehoash became king in the seventh year of Jehu, and reigned for forty years in Jerusalem. His
mother’s name was Zibiah of Beersheba.

2Ki 12:3 All his life Jehoash did what Yahweh regards as right, having been instructed by Jehoiada the priest.
2Ki 12:4 The high places, however, were not abolished, and the people still offered sacrifices and incense on
the high places.

2Ki 12:5 Jehoash said to the priests, “All the money from the sacred revenues brought to the Temple of



Yahweh, the money from personal taxes, and all the money voluntarily offered to the Temple-

2Ki 12:6 the priests are to receive this individually from people of their acquaintance and will carry out all the

repairs to the Temple which need to be made”.

2Ki 12:7 Now in the twenty-third year of King Jehoash the priests had done no repairs to the Temple;

2Ki 12:8 so King Jehoash summoned Jehoiada the priest and the other priests. “Why are you not repairing the
Temple?”. he asked. “You are no longer to accept money from people of your acquaintance but are to hand it over
for the Temple repairs”.

2Ki 12:9 The priests agreed to accept no money from the people and no longer to be responsible for repairs to
the Temple.

2Ki 12:10 Jehoiada the priest took a chest, bored a hole in the lid and placed it beside the pillar, to the right of
the entry to the Temple of Yahweh; in it the priests who guarded the threshold put all the money which was given
for the Temple of Yahweh.

2Ki 12:1 1 Whenever they saw that there was a great deal of money in the chest, the king’s secretary would
come, and they would empty it out and reckon the money then in the Temple of Yahweh.

2Ki 12:12 Once checked, they paid this money over to the masters of works attached to the Temple of Yahweh,
and these in turn spent it on carpenters and builders working on the Temple of Yahweh,

2Ki 12:13 on masons and stonecutters, and on buying timber and dressed stone to be used for repairs to the
Temple of Yahweh; in short, for all the costs of the Temple repairs.

2Ki 12:14 But no silver basins, knives, sprinkling bowls, trumpets or gold or silver objects were made for the
Temple of Yahweh out of the money presented,

2Ki 12:15 which was all given to the masters of works for repairing the Temple of Yahweh.

2Ki 12:16 No accounts were kept with the men to whom the money was paid over to be spent on the workmen,
since they were honest in their work.

2Ki 12:17 Money offered in expiation of an offence or of a sin was not given to the Temple of Yahweh; that was
for the priests.

2Ki 12:18 At that time Hazael king of Aram went to war against Gath, and captured it; he then prepared to attack
Jerusalem.

2Ki 12:19 Jehoash king of Judah took all the sacred offerings dedicated by his ancestors, the kings of Judah,
Jehoshaphat, Jehoram and Ahaziah, with those which he himself had dedicated, and all the gold which was to
be found in the treasuries of the Temple of Yahweh and of the palace; he sent it all to Hazael king of Aram, who
retired from Jerusalem.

2Ki 12:20 The rest of the history of Joash, his entire career, is this not recorded in the Book of the Annals of the
Kings of Judah?

2Ki 12:21 His own retainers rebelled and hatched a plot; they murdered Joash in the palace of the Millo …

2Ki 12:22 Jozacar son of Shimeath and Jehozabad son of Shomer were the retainers who struck the blows from
which he died. He was buried with his ancestors in the City of David; his son Amaziah succeeded him.

2Ki 13:1 In the twenty-third year of Joash son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz son of Jehu became king of
Israel in Samaria. He reigned for seventeen years.

2Ki 13:2 He did what is displeasing to Yahweh and copied the sin into which Jeroboam son of Nebat had led
Israel; he did not give it up.

2Ki 13:3 This aroused Yahweh’s anger against the Israelites, and he delivered them without respite into the
power of Hazael king of Aram and of Ben-Hadad son of Hazael.

2Ki 13:4 Jehoahaz, however, tried to placate Yahweh, and Yahweh heard him, for he had seen the oppression
which the king of Aram was inflicting on Israel.

2Ki 13:5 Yahweh gave Israel a saviour who freed them from the grip of Aram, and the Israelites lived in their
tents as in the past.

2Ki 13:6 But they did not give up the sin into which Jeroboam had led Israel; they persisted in it, and even the
sacred pole stayed standing in Samaria.

2Ki 13:7 Of Jehoahaz’s army Yahweh left only fifty horsemen, ten chariots and ten thousand foot soldiers. The
king of Aram had destroyed them, making them like dust trampled underfoot.

2Ki 13:8 The rest of the history of Jehoahaz, his entire career, his prowess, is this not recorded in the Book of
the Annals of the Kings of Israel?

2Ki 13:9 Then Jehoahaz fell asleep with his ancestors, and was buried in Samaria; his son Joash succeeded
him.

2Ki 13:10 In the thirty-seventh year of Joash king of Judah, Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, became king of Israel in
Samaria. He reigned for sixteen years.

2Ki 13:1 1 He did what is displeasing to Yahweh, he did not give up the sin into which Jeroboam son of Nebat
had led Israel; he persisted in it.

2Ki 13:12 The rest of the history of Joash, his entire career, his prowess, how he waged war on Amaziah king of



Judah, is this not recorded in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel?

2Ki 13:13 Then Joash fell asleep with his ancestors, and Jeroboam ascended his throne. Joash was buried in
Samaria with the kings of Israel.

2Ki 13:14 When Elisha had fallen ill of the illness of which he was to die, Joash king of Israel went down to him
and shedding tears over him said, “Father! Father! Chariot of Israel and its chargers!”.

2Ki 13:15 Elisha said to him, “Bring bow and arrows”, and he sent for a bow and arrows.

2Ki 13:16 Then Elisha said to the king, “Draw the bow”, and he drew it. Elisha put his hands over the hands of
the king,

2Ki 13:17 then he said, “Open the window towards the east”, and he opened it. Then Elisha said, “Shoot!”. And he
shot. Elisha said, “Arrow of victory over Aram! You will defeat Aram at Aphek-completely”.

2Ki 13:18 Elisha said, Take the arrows”, and he took them. Then he said to the king, “Strike the ground”, and he
struck it three times, then stopped.

2Ki 13:19 At this the man of God grew angry with him. “You should have struck half a dozen times”, he said, “and
you would have beaten Aram completely; now you will beat Aram only three times”.

2Ki 13:20 Elisha died and was buried. Bands of Moabites were making incursions into the country every year.
2Ki 13:21 Some people happened to be carrying a man out for burial; at the sight of one of these bands, they
flung the man into the tomb of Elisha and made off. The man had no sooner touched the bones of Elisha than he
came to life and stood up on his feet.

2Ki 13:22 Flazael king of Aram had oppressed the Israelites throughout the lifetime of Jehoahaz,

2Ki 13:23 but Yahweh was kind and took pity on them. Because of the covenant which he had made with
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, he relented towards them; he had no wish to destroy them, he did not cast them out
of his presence.

2Ki 13:24 Flazael king of Aram died, and his son Ben-Fladad succeeded him.

2Ki 13:25 From Ben-Hadad son of Flazael, Jehoash son of Jehoahaz recaptured the towns which Flazael had
seized from his father Jehoahaz by force of arms. Joash defeated him three times and recovered the Israelite
towns.

2Ki 14:1 In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel, Amaziah son of Joash became king of
Judah.

2Ki 14:2 He was twenty-five years old when he came to the throne, and he reigned for twenty-nine years in
Jerusalem. FHis mother’s name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem.

2Ki 14:3 He did what Yahweh regards as right, though not like his ancestor David; he imitated his father Joash
in all respects.

2Ki 14:4 The high places, however, were not abolished, and the people still offered sacrifices and incense on
the high places.

2Ki 14:5 Once the kingdom was firmly under his control, he killed those of his retainers who had murdered the
king his father.

2Ki 14:6 But he did not put the murderers’ sons to death, in accordance with what is written in the Book of
Moses, where Yahweh has commanded: “Parents may not be put to death for their children, nor children for
parents, but each must be put to death for his own crime”.

2Ki 14:7 It was he who slaughtered the Edomites in the Valley of Salt, ten thousand of them, and captured the
Rock; he gave it the name Joktheel, which it bears to the present day.

2Ki 14:8 Amaziah then sent messengers to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel, saying, “Come and make a
trial of strength!”.

2Ki 14:9 Jehoash king of Israel sent back word to Amaziah king of Judah, “The thistle of Lebanon sent a
message to the cedar of Lebanon, saying, ‘Give my son your daughter in marriage’; but a wild animal of the
Lebanon ran over the thistle and squashed it.

2Ki 14:10 You have conquered Edom and now aspire to even greater glory. Stay where you belong! Why
provoke disaster, to your own and Judah’s ruin?”.

2Ki 14:1 1 But Amaziah would not listen, so Jehoash king of Israel marched to the attack. And at Beth-Shemesh,
which belongs to Judah, he and Amaziah king of Judah made their trial of strength.

2Ki 14:12 Judah was defeated by Israel, and everyone fled to his tent.

2Ki 14:13 The king of Judah, Amaziah son of Jehoash, son of Ahaziah, was taken prisoner at Beth-Shemesh by
Jehoash king of Israel who led him off to Jerusalem, where he demolished four hundred cubits of the city wall
between the Ephraim Gate and the Corner Gate;

2Ki 14:14 all the gold and silver, and all the vessels to be found in the Temple of Yahweh and in the palace
treasury, and hostages besides, he then took back with him to Samaria.

2Ki 14:15 The rest of the history of Jehoash, his entire career, his prowess, how he waged war on Amaziah king
of Judah, is this not recorded in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Israel?

2Ki 14:16 Then Joash fell asleep with his ancestors, and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; his son



Jeroboam succeeded him.

2Ki 14:17 Amaziah son of Joash, king of Judah, lived for fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of
Jehoahaz, king of Israel.

2Ki 14:18 The rest of the history of Amaziah, is this not recorded in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of
Judah?

2Ki 14:19 A plot having been hatched against him in Jerusalem, he fled to Lachish; but he was followed to
Lachish where he was murdered.

2Ki 14:20 He was then transported by horse and buried in Jerusalem with his ancestors in the City of David.

2Ki 14:21 All the people of Judah then chose Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in
succession to his father Amaziah.

2Ki 14:22 It was he who rebuilt Elath, recovering it for Judah, after the king had fallen asleep with his ancestors.
2Ki 14:23 In the fifteenth year of Amaziah son of Joash, king of Judah, Jeroboam son of Joash became king of
Israel in Samaria. He reigned for forty-one years.

2Ki 14:24 He did what is displeasing to Yahweh and did not give up any of the sins into which Jeroboam son of
Nebat had led Israel.

2Ki 14:25 It was he who recovered the territory of Israel from the Pass of Hamath to the Sea of the Arabah, in
accordance with the word which Yahweh, God of Israel, had spoken through his servant Jonah son of Amittai,
the prophet from Gath-Hepher.

2Ki 14:26 For Yahweh had seen how very bitter the affliction of Israel was, with no one, either fettered or free, to
come to Israel’s help.

2Ki 14:27 But Yahweh had resolved not to blot out the name of Israel under heaven; he rescued them by means
of Jeroboam son of Joash.

2Ki 14:28 The rest of the history of Jeroboam, his entire career, his prowess, what wars he waged, how he
brought Damascus and Hamath back to their allegiance to Judah and Israel, is this not recorded in the Book of
the Annals of the Kings of Israel?

2Ki 14:29 Then Jeroboam fell asleep with his ancestors and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; his
son Zechariah succeeded him.

2Ki 15:1 In the seventeenth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Uzziah son of Amaziah became king of Judah.

2Ki 15:2 He was sixteen years old when he came to the throne, and he reigned for fifty-two years in Jerusalem.
His mother’s name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.

2Ki 15:3 He did what Yahweh regards as right, just as his father Amaziah had done.

2Ki 15:4 The high places, however, were not abolished, and the people still offered sacrifices and incense on
the high places.

2Ki 15:5 But Yahweh struck the king, and he was afflicted with a virulent skin-disease till his dying day. He lived
confined to his room, while Jotham the king’s son, who was master of the palace, governed the country.

2Ki 15:6 The rest of the history of Uzziah, his entire career, is this not recorded in the Book of the Annals of the
Kings of Judah?

2Ki 15:7 Then Uzziah fell asleep with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David; his son Jotham then
succeeded him.

2Ki 15:8 In the thirty-eighth year of Uzziah king of Judah, Zechariah son of Jeroboam became king of Israel in
Samaria for six months.

2Ki 15:9 He did what is displeasing to Yahweh, as his fathers had done; he did not give up the sins into which
Jeroboam son of Nebat had led Israel. Shallum son of Jabesh plotted against him, murdered him at Ibleam,

2Ki 15:10 and succeeded him.

2Ki 15:1 1 The rest of the history of Zechariah is recorded in the Book of Annals of the Kings of Israel.

2Ki 15:12 This was the word which Yahweh had spoken to Jehu, “Your sons will sit on the throne of Israel to the
fourth generation”. And so it turned out.

2Ki 15:13 Shallum son of Jabesh became king in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah king of Judah and reigned for
one month in Samaria.

2Ki 15:14 Then Menahem son of Gadi marched from Tirzah, entered Samaria, murdered Shallum son of Jabesh
there and succeeded him.

2Ki 15:15 The rest of the history of Shallum, and the plot he hatched, is recorded in the Book of the Annals of
the Kings of Israel.

2Ki 15:16 Menahem then sacked Tappuah — killing all who were in it — and its territory from Tirzah onwards,
because it had not opened its gates to him; he sacked the town and disembowelled all the pregnant women.

2Ki 15:17 In the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah king of Judah, Menahem son of Gadi became king of Israel. He
reigned for ten years in Samaria.

2Ki 15:18 He did what is displeasing to Yahweh, he did not give up the sins into which Jeroboam son of Nebat
had led Israel. In his days



2Ki 15:19 Pul king of Assyria invaded the country. Menahem gave Pul a thousand talants of silver in return for
his support in strengthening his hold on the royal power.

2Ki 15:20 Menahem levied this sum from Israel, from all the men of rank, at the rate of fifty shekels a head, to
be given to the king of Assyria, who then withdrew and did not stay in the country.

2Ki 15:21 The rest of the history of Menahem, his entire career, is this not recorded in the Book of the Annals of
the Kings of Israel?

2Ki 15:22 Then Menahem fell asleep with his ancestors; his son Pekahiah succeeded him.

2Ki 15:23 In the fiftieth year of Uzziah king of Judah, Pekahiah son of Menahem became king of Israel in
Samaria. He reigned for two years.

2Ki 15:24 He did what is displeasing to Yahweh; he did not give up the sins into which Jeroboam son of Nebat
had led Israel.

2Ki 15:25 Pekah son of Remaliah, his equerry, plotted against him and assassinated him in the palace keep …
He had fifty Gileadites with him. He killed the king and succeeded him.

2Ki 15:26 The rest of the history of Pekahiah, his entire career, is recorded in the Book of the Annals of the
Kings of Israel.

2Ki 15:27 In the fifty-second year of Uzziah king of Judah, Pekah son of Remaliah became king of Israel in
Samaria. He reigned for twenty years.

2Ki 15:28 He did what is displeasing to Yahweh; he did not give up the sins into which Jeroboam son of Nebat
had led Israel.

2Ki 15:29 In the days of Pekah king of Israel, Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria came and captured Ijon, Abel-Beth-
Maacah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead and Galilee — the whole territory of Naphtali and deported the
population to Assyria.

2Ki 15:30 Hoshea son of Elah hatched a plot against Pekah son of Remaliah; he murdered the king and
succeeded him.

2Ki 15:31 The rest of the history of Pekah, his entire career, is recorded in the Book of the Annals of the Kings
of Israel.

2Ki 15:32 In the second year of Pekah son of Remaliah, king of Israel, Jotham son of Uzziah became king of
Judah.

2Ki 15:33 He was twenty-five years old when he came to the throne, and he reigned for sixteen years in
Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jerusha daughter of Zadok.

2Ki 15:34 He did what Yahweh regards as right, just as his father Uzziah had done.

2Ki 15:35 The high places, however, were not abolished, and the people still offered sacrifices and incense on
the high places. It was he who built the Upper Gate of the Temple of Yahweh.

2Ki 1 5:36 The rest of the history of Jotham, his entire career, is this not recorded in the Book of the Annals of
the Kings of Judah?

2Ki 1 5:37 At that time Yahweh began sending Razon king of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah against Judah.
2Ki 15:38 Then Jotham fell asleep with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David, his ancestor; his son
Ahaz succeeded him.

2Ki 16:1 In the seventeenth year of Pekah son of Remaliah, Ahaz son of Jotham became king of Judah.

2Ki 16:2 Ahaz was twenty years old when he came to the throne, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem.
He did not do what Yahweh his God regards as right, as his ancestor David had done.

2Ki 16:3 He followed the example of the kings of Israel, even causing his son to pass through the fire of
sacrifice, also copying the disgusting practices of the nations whom Yahweh had dispossessed for the Israelites.
2Ki 16:4 He offered sacrifices and incense on the high places, on the hills and under every luxuriant tree.

2Ki 16:5 Then it was that Razon king of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah, king of Israel, launched their
campaign against Jerusalem. They besieged it but could not reduce it.

2Ki 16:6 (At that time, the king of Edom recovered Elath for Edom; he drove the Judaeans out of Elath, and the
Edomites occupied it and have been there ever since.)

2Ki 16:7 Ahaz then sent messengers to Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria to say, “I am your servant and your son.
Come and rescue me from the king of Aram and the king of Israel who are making war on me”.

2Ki 16:8 And Ahaz took what silver and gold was to be found in the Temple of Yahweh and in the palace
treasury, and sent this as a present to the king of Assyria.

2Ki 16:9 The king of Assyria granted his request and, marching on Damascus, captured it; he deported its
population to Kir and put Razon to death.

2Ki 16:10 When King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria, he saw the altar which
was in Damascus. King Ahaz then sent a picture and model of the altar, with details of its construction, to Uriah
the priest.

2Ki 16:1 1 Uriah the priest constructed the altar; all the instructions sent by King Ahaz from Damascus were
carried out by Uriah the priest before King Ahaz returned from Damascus.



2Ki 16:12 When the king arrived from Damascus, he inspected the altar, he approached it and ascended it.

2Ki 16:13 And on the altar he made his burnt offering and his oblation; he poured out his libation and sprinkled
the blood of his communion sacrifices.

2Ki 16:14 The altar which used to stand before Yahweh he removed from the front of the Temple, where it had
stood between the new altar and the Temple of Yahweh, and placed it at the north side of the new altar.

2Ki 16:15 King Ahaz gave this order to Uriah the priest, “In future you will present the morning burnt offering, the
evening oblation, the king’s burnt offering and oblation, the burnt offering, the oblation and the libations of all the
people of the country on the large altar; on it you will pour out all the blood of the burnt offerings and sacrifices.
As regards the bronze altar, I shall see to that”.

2Ki 16:16 Uriah the priest did everything that King Ahaz had ordered.

2Ki 16:17 King Ahaz broke up the wheeled stands; removed the crosspieces and the basins from them, and
took the bronze Sea off the oxen supporting it, and rested it on the stone pavement.

2Ki 16:18 And from the Temple of Yahweh, in deference to the king of Assyria, he removed the dais for the
throne which had been built inside, and the royal entrance on the outside.

2Ki 16:19 The rest of the history of Ahaz, his entire career, is this not recorded in the Book of the Annals of the
Kings of Judah?

2Ki 16:20 Then Ahaz fell asleep with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David; his son Hezekiah
succeeded him.

2Ki 17:1 In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah, Hoshea son of Elah became king of Israel in Samaria, and
reigned for nine years.

2Ki 17:2 He did what is displeasing to Yahweh, though not like the preceding kings of Israel.

2Ki 17:3 Shalmaneser king of Assyria made war on Hoshea who submitted to him and paid him tribute.

2Ki 17:4 But the king of Assyria discovered that Hoshea was playing a double game with him; he had sent
messengers to Sais, to the king of Egypt, and had not, as in previous years, handed over the tribute to the king
of Assyria. For this the king of Assyria imprisoned him in chains.

2Ki 17:5 The king of Assyria invaded the whole country and, coming to Samaria, laid siege to it for three years.
2Ki 17:6 In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria captured Samaria and deported the Israelites to
Assyria. He settled them in Halah on the Habor, a river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.

2Ki 17:7 This happened because the Israelites had sinned against Yahweh their God who had brought them out
of Egypt, out of the grip of Pharaoh king of Egypt. They worshipped other gods,

2Ki 17:8 they followed the practices of the nations which Yahweh had dispossessed for them.

2Ki 17:9 The Israelites spoke slightingly of Yahweh their God. They built themselves high places wherever they
lived, from watchtower to fortified town.

2Ki 17:10 They set up pillars and sacred poles for themselves on every high hill and under every luxuriant tree.
2Ki 17:1 1 They sacrificed on all the high places like the nations which Yahweh had expelled for them, and did
wicked things there, provoking Yahweh’s anger.

2Ki 17:12 They served idols, although Yahweh had told them, “This you must not do”.

2Ki 17:13 And yet through all the prophets and the seers, Yahweh had given Israel and Judah this warning,

“Turn from your wicked ways and keep my commandments and my laws in accordance with the entire Law which
I laid down for your fathers and delivered to them through my servants the prophets”.

2Ki 17:14 But they would not listen, they were as stubborn as their ancestors, who had no faith in Yahweh their
God.

2Ki 17:15 They despised his laws and the covenant which he had made with their ancestors and the warnings
which he had given them. Pursuing futility, they themselves became futile through copying the nations round
them, although Yahweh had ordered them not to act as they did.

2Ki 17:16 They rejected all the commandments of Yahweh their God and cast themselves metal idols, two
calves; they made themselves sacred poles, they worshipped the whole array of heaven, and they served Baal.
2Ki 17:17 They caused their sons and daughters to pass through the fire of sacrifice, also they practised
divination and sorcery, they sold themselves to doing what displeases Yahweh, provoking his anger.

2Ki 17:18 Because of which, Yahweh became enraged with Israel and thrust them away from him. The tribe of
Judah was the only one left.

2Ki 17:19 Judah did not keep the commandments of Yahweh their God either but copied the practices which
Israel had introduced.

2Ki 17:20 Yahweh rejected the whole race of Israel; he brought them low, delivering them into the hands of
marauders, until at length he thrust them away from him.

2Ki 17:21 And indeed he had torn Israel away from the House of David, and they had made Jeroboam son of
Nebat king; Jeroboam had drawn Israel away from Yahweh and led them into a great sin.

2Ki 17:22 The Israelites copied the sin which Jeroboam had committed; they did not give it up,

2Ki 17:23 until at length Yahweh thrust Israel away from him, as he had foretold through all his servants the



prophets; he deported the Israelites from their own country to Assyria, where they have been ever since.

2Ki 17:24 The king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath and Sepharvaim, and
settled them in the towns of Samaria to replace the Israelites; these took possession of Samaria and lived in its
towns.

2Ki 17:25 When they first came to live there, they did not worship Yahweh; hence, Yahweh set lions on them,
which killed a number of them.

2Ki 17:26 Consequently, the king of Assyria was informed as follows, The nations whom you deported and
settled in the towns of Samaria do not know how to worship the local god, and he has set lions on them; and
now these are killing them because they do not know how to worship the local god”.

2Ki 17:27 So the king of Assyria gave this order, “Send back one of the priests whom I deported from there; let
him go and live there and teach them how to worship the local god”.

2Ki 17:28 Accordingly, one of the priests who had been deported from Samaria came to live in Bethel; he taught
them how to worship Yahweh.

2Ki 17:29 Each nationality made gods of its own and put them in the shrines on the high places built by the
Samaritans; each nationality did this in the towns where it lived.

2Ki 17:30 The people from Babylon had made a Succoth-Benoth, the people from Cuthah a Nergal, the people
from Hamath an Ashima,

2Ki 17:31 the Avvites a Nibhaz and a Tartak; while the Sepharvites caused their children to pass through the fire
of sacrifice to Adrammelech and Anammelech, gods of Sepharvaim.

2Ki 17:32 They worshipped Yahweh as well, and they appointed priests out of their own number for the high
places, and these officiated in the shrines on the high places.

2Ki 17:33 They worshipped Yahweh and served their own gods at the same time, with the rites of the countries
from which they had been deported.

2Ki 17:34 They still follow their old rites even now. They did not worship Yahweh and did not conform to his
statutes or ritual, or the law or the commandments, which Yahweh had laid down for the sons of Jacob to whom
he gave the name Israel.

2Ki 17:35 Yahweh had made a covenant with them and had given them this command, “You are not to worship
alien gods, you are not to bow down to them or serve them or offer them sacrifices.

2Ki 17:36 You are to bow down and offer sacrifice only to Yahweh who brought you out of Egypt with great
power and outstretched arm.

2Ki 17:37 You are to observe the statutes and ritual, the law and the commandments which he has given you in
writing and to which you are always to conform; you are not to worship alien gods.

2Ki 17:38 Do not forget the covenant which I have made with you, and do not venerate alien gods.

2Ki 17:39 But venerate Yahweh your God, and he will deliver you from the clutches of all your enemies”.

2Ki 17:40 But they would not listen and still followed their old rites.

2Ki 17:41 These nationalities, then, worshipped Yahweh and served their idols as well, as did their children; and
their children’s children still behave today as their ancestors behaved in the past.

2Ki 18:1 In the third year of Hoshea son of Elah, king of Israel, Hezekiah son of Ahaz became king of Judah.

2Ki 18:2 He was twenty-five years old when he came to the throne, and he reigned for twenty-nine years in
Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Abijah daughter of Zechariah.

2Ki 18:3 He did what Yahweh regards as right, just as his ancestor David had done.

2Ki 18:4 He abolished the high places, broke the pillars, cut down the sacred poles and smashed the bronze
serpent which Moses had made; for up to that time the Israelites had offered sacrifices to it; it was called
Nehushtan.

2Ki 18:5 He put his trust in Yahweh, God of Israel. No king of Judah after him could be compared with him — nor
any of those before him.

2Ki 18:6 He was devoted to Yahweh, never turning from him, but keeping the commandments which Yahweh
had laid down for Moses.

2Ki 18:7 And so Yahweh was with him, and he was successful in all that he undertook. He rebelled against the
king of Assyria and refused to serve him.

2Ki 18:8 He beat the Philistines back to Gaza, laying their territory waste from watchtower to fortified town.

2Ki 18:9 In the fourth year of Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah, king of Israel,
Shalmaneser king of Assyria marched on Samaria and laid siege to it.

2Ki 18:10 He captured it after three years. Samaria fell in the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of
Hoshea king of Israel.

2Ki 18:1 1 The king of Assyria deported the Israelites to Assyria and settled them in Halah on the Habor, a river
of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.

2Ki 18:12 This happened because they had not obeyed the voice of Yahweh their God and had broken his
covenant, everything that Moses servant of Yahweh had laid down. They neither listened to it nor put it into



practice.

2Ki 18:13 In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king of Assyria advanced on all the fortified
towns of Judah and captured them.

2Ki 18:14 Then Hezekiah king of Judah sent this message to the king of Assyria at Lachish, “I have been at
fault. Call off the attack, and I will submit to whatever you impose on me”. The king of Assyria exacted three
hundred talants of silver and thirty talants of gold from Hezekiah king of Judah,

2Ki 18:15 and Hezekiah gave him all the silver in the Temple of Yahweh and in the palace treasury.

2Ki 18:16 At which time, Hezekiah stripped the facing from the leaves and jambs of the doors of the Temple of
Yahweh, which an earlier king of Judah had put on, and gave it to the king of Assyria.

2Ki 18:17 From Lachish the king of Assyria sent the cupbearer-in-chief with a large force to King Hezekiah in
Jerusalem. He marched on Jerusalem and, on his arrival, took up position near the conduit of the upper pool
which is on the road to the Fuller’s Field.

2Ki 18:18 He summoned the king. The master of the palace, Eliakim son of Hilkiah, Shebnah the secretary and
the herald Joah son of Asaph went out to him.

2Ki 18:19 The cupbearer-in-chief said to them, “Say to Hezekiah, ‘The great king, the king of Assyria, says this:
What makes you so confident?

2Ki 18:20 Do you think empty words are as good as strategy and military strength? Who are you relying on, to
dare to rebel against me?

2Ki 18:21 There you are, relying on that broken reed Egypt, which pricks and pierces the hand of whoëver leans
on it. That is what Pharaoh king of Egypt is like to all who rely on him.

2Ki 18:22 You may say to me: We rely on Yahweh our God. But have his high places and altars not been
suppressed by Hezekiah who told Judah and Jerusalem: Here, in Jerusalem, is the altar before which you must
worship?

2Ki 18:23 Very well, then, make a wager with my lord the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses if
you can find horsemen to ride them.

2Ki 18:24 How could you repel a single one of the least of my master’s soldiers? And yet you have relied on
Egypt for chariots and horsemen.

2Ki 18:25 And lastly, have I marched on this place to lay it waste without warrant from Yahweh? Yahweh
himself said to me: March on this country and lay it waste’”.

2Ki 18:26 Eliakim, Shebnah and Joah said to the cupbearer-in-chief, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic,
for we understand it; do not speak to us in the Judaean language within earshot of the people on the ramparts”.
2Ki 18:27 But the cupbearer-in-chief said, “Do you think my lord sent me here to say these things to your master
or to you? On the contrary, it was to the people sitting on the ramparts who, like you, are doomed to eat their
own dung and drink their own urine”.

2Ki 18:28 The cupbearer-in-chief then drew himself up and shouted loudly in the Judaean language, “Listen to
the word of the great king, the king of Assyria.

2Ki 18:29 The king says this, ‘Do not let Hezekiah delude you. He will be powerless to save you from my
clutches.

2Ki 18:30 Do not let Hezekiah persuade you to rely on Yahweh by saying: Yahweh is sure to save us; this city
will not fall into the king of Assyria’s clutches.

2Ki 18:31 Do not listen to Hezekiah, for the king of Assyria says this: Make peace with me, surrender to me, and
every one of you will be free to eat the fruit of his own vine and of his own fig tree and to drink the water of his
own storage-well

2Ki 18:32 until I come and take you away to a country like your own, a land of corn and good wine, a land of
bread and vineyards, a land of oil and honey: and so you will survive and not die. Do not listen to Hezekiah; he is
deluding you when he says: Yahweh will save us.

2Ki 1 8:33 Has any god of any nation been able to save his country from the king of Assyria’s clutches?

2Ki 18:34 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim and Hena and Ivvah?
Where are the local gods of Samaria? Did they save Samaria from my clutches?

2Ki 18:35 Of all the local gods, which ones have saved their countries from my clutches, for Yahweh to be able
to save Jerusalem from my clutches?’”.

2Ki 18:36 The people, however, kept quiet and said nothing in reply, since the king had given the order, “You
are not to answer him”.

2Ki 18:37 The master of the palace, Eliakim son of Hilkiah, Shebnah the secretary and the herald Joah son of
Asaph, with their clothes torn, went to Hezekiah and reported what the cupbearer-in-chief had said.

2Ki 19:1 On hearing this, King Hezekiah tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and went to the Temple of Yahweh.
2Ki 19:2 He sent Eliakim master of the palace, Shebnah the secretary and the elders of the priests, wearing
sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.

2Ki 19:3 They said to him, “This is what Hezekiah says, ‘Today is a day of suffering, of punishment, of disgrace.



Children come to birth, and there is no strength to bring them forth.

2Ki 19:4 May Yahweh your God hear the words of the cupbearer-in-chief whom his master, the king of Assyria,
has sent to insult the living God, and may Yahweh your God punish the words he has heard. Offer your prayer
for the remnant still remaining’”.

2Ki 19:5 King Hezekiah’s ministers went to Isaiah,

2Ki 19:6 and Isaiah said to them, “Say to your master, ‘Yahweh says this: Do not be afraid of the words which
you have heard or the blasphemies which the king of Assyria’s minions have uttered against me.

2Ki 19:7 Look, I am going to put a spirit in him and, on the strength of a rumour, he will go back to his own
country, and in that country I shall make him fall by the sword’”.

2Ki 19:8 The cupbearer turned about and rejoined the king of Assyria, who was then attacking Libnah, as the

cupbearer had learnt that the king had already left Lachish

2Ki 19:9 on hearing that Tirhakah king of Cush was on his way to attack him.

2Ki 19:10 Sennacherib again sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, “Tell Hezekiah king of Judah this, ‘Do not
let your God on whom you are relying deceive you with the promise: Jerusalem will not fall into the king of
Assyria’s clutches.

2Ki 19:1 1 You have learnt by now what the kings of Assyria have done to all the other countries, devoting them
to destruction. Are you likely to be saved?

2Ki 19:12 Did the gods of the nations whom my ancestors devastated save them-Gozan, Haran, Rezeph and
the Edenites who were in Tel Basar?

2Ki 19:13 Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of Lair, of Sepharvaim, of Hena, of Ivvah?’”.
2Ki 19:14 Hezekiah took the letter from the messengers’ hands and read it; he then went up to the Temple of
Yahweh and spread it out before Yahweh.

2Ki 19:15 Hezekiah said this prayer in the presence of Yahweh, “Yahweh Sabaoth, God of Israel, enthroned on
the winged creatures, you alone are God of all the kingdoms of the world, you made heaven and earth.

2Ki 19:16 Give ear, Yahweh, and listen; open your eyes, Yahweh, and see! Hear the words of Sennacherib,
who has sent to insult the living God.

2Ki 19:17 It is true, Yahweh, that the kings of Assyria have destroyed the nations,

2Ki 19:18 they have thrown their gods on the fire, for these were not gods but human artefacts — wood and
stone — and hence they have destroyed them.

2Ki 19:19 But now, Yahweh our God, save us from his clutches, I beg you, and let all the kingdoms of the world
know that you alone are God, Yahweh”.

2Ki 19:20 Isaiah son of Amoz then sent the following message to Hezekiah, “Yahweh, God of Israel, says this, ‘I
have heard the prayer which you have addressed to me about Sennacherib king of Assyria’.

2Ki 19:21 Here is the pronouncement which Yahweh has made about him: ‘She despises you, she scorns you,
the virgin daughter of Zion; she tosses her head at you, the daughter of Jerusalem!

2Ki 19:22 Whom have you insulted, whom have you blasphemed? Against whom raised your voice and lifted
your haughty eyes? Against the Holy One of Israel!

2Ki 19:23 Through your envoys you have insulted the Lord, thinking: With my many chariots I have climbed the
mountain-tops, the utmost peaks of Lebanon. I have felled its mighty cedars, its finest cypresses, have reached
its furthest recesses, its forest garden.

2Ki 19:24 Yes, I have dug and drunk of foreign waters; under the soles of my feet I have dried up all Egypt’s
rivers.

2Ki 19:25 ‘Do you hear? Long ago I prepared this, from days of old I actually planned it, now I carry it out. You
were to lay walled cities in heaps of ruins;

2Ki 19:26 that was why their inhabitants, feeble of hand, were dismayed and discomfited, were weak as grass,
were frail as plants, were like grass of housetop and meadow under the east wind.

2Ki 19:27 But whether you stand up or you sit down, whether you go out or you come in, I know it.

2Ki 19:28 Because you have raved against me, and your arrogance has reached my ears, I shall put a hook
through your nostrils and a muzzle on your lips, and make you return by the road by which you came.

2Ki 19:29 ‘And this will be the sign for you: this year will be eaten the self-sown grain, next year what sprouts in
the fallow; but in the third year sow and reap, plant vineyards and eat their fruit.

2Ki 19:30 The surviving remnant of the House of Judah will bring forth new roots below and fruits above;

2Ki 19:31 for a remnant will issue from Jerusalem, and survivors from Mount Zion. Yahweh Sabaoth’s jealous
love will accomplish this.

2Ki 19:32 ‘This, then, is what Yahweh says about the king of Assyria: ‘He will not enter this city, will shoot no
arrow at it, confront it with no shield, throw up no earthwork against it.

2Ki 19:33 By the road by which he came, by that he will return; he will not enter this city, declares Yahweh.

2Ki 19:34 I shall protect this city and save it for my sake and my servant David’s sake’”.

2Ki 19:35 That same night the angel of Yahweh went out and struck down a hundred and eighty-five thousand



men in the Assyrian camp. In the early morning when it was time to get up, there they lay, so many corpses.

2Ki 19:36 Sennacherib struck camp and left; he returned home and stayed in Nineveh.

2Ki 19:37 One day when he was worshipping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and
Sharezer struck him down with the sword and escaped into the territory of Ararat. His son Esarhaddon
succeeded him.

2Ki 20:1 About then Hezekiah fell ill and was at the point of death. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz came and
said to him, “Yahweh says this, ‘Put your affairs in order, for you are going to die, you will not live’”.

2Ki 20:2 Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and addressed this prayer to Yahweh,

2Ki 20:3 “Ah, Yahweh, remember, I beg you, that I have behaved faithfully and with sincerity of heart in your
presence and done what you regard as right”. And Hezekiah shed many tears.

2Ki 20:4 Isaiah had not left the middle court, before the word of Yahweh came to him,

2Ki 20:5 “Go back and say to Hezekiah, prince of my people, ‘Yahweh, the God of your ancestor David, says
this: I have heard your prayer and seen your tears. I shall cure you: in three days’ time you will go up to the
Temple of Yahweh.

2Ki 20:6 I shall add fifteen years to your life. I shall save you and this city from the king of Assyria’s clutches and
defend this city for my sake and my servant David’s sake’”.

2Ki 20:7 “Bring a fig poultice”, Isaiah said; they brought one, applied it to the ulcer, and the king recovered.

2Ki 20:8 Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “What is the sign to tell me that Yahweh will cure me and that I shall be going
up to the Temple of Yahweh in three days’ time?”.

2Ki 20:9 “Here”, Isaiah replied, “is the sign from Yahweh that he will do what he has said; would you like the
shadow to go forward ten steps, or to go back ten steps?”.

2Ki 20:10 “It is easy for the shadow to lengthen ten steps”, Hezekiah replied. “No, I would rather the shadow
went back ten steps”.

2Ki 20:1 1 The prophet Isaiah then called on Yahweh, who made the shadow cast by the declining sun on the
steps - the steps to Ahaz’s roof-room — go back ten steps.

2Ki 20:12 At that time the king of Babylon, Merodach-Baladan son of Baladan, sent letters and a gift to
Hezekiah, for he had heard of his illness and his recovery.

2Ki 20:13 Hezekiah was delighted at this and showed the ambassadors his entire treasury, the silver, gold,
spices, precious oil, his armoury too, and everything to be seen in his storehouses. There was nothing in his
palace or in his whole domain that Hezekiah did not show them.

2Ki 20:14 The prophet Isaiah then came to King Hezekiah and asked him, “What have these men said, and
where have they come from?”. Hezekiah answered, “They have come from a distant country, from Babylon”.

2Ki 20:15 Isaiah said, “What have they seen in your palace?”. “They have seen everything in my palace”,
Hezekiah answered. “There is nothing in my storehouses that I have not shown them”.

2Ki 20:16 Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Listen to the word of Yahweh,

2Ki 20:17 ‘The days are coming when everything in your palace, everything that your ancestors have amassed
until now, will be carried off to Babylon. Not a thing will be left’, Yahweh says.

2Ki 20:18 ‘Sons sprung from you, sons fathered by you, will be abducted to be eunuchs in the palace of the
king of Babylon’”.

2Ki 20:19 Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “This word of Yahweh that you announce is reässuring”, for he was thinking,
“And why not? So long as there is peace and security during my lifetime”.

2Ki 20:20 The rest of the history of Hezekiah, all his prowess, how he constructed the pool and the conduit to
bring water into the city, is this not recorded in the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?

2Ki 20:21 Then Hezekiah fell asleep with his ancestors; his son Manasseh succeeded him.

2Ki 21 :1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he came to the throne and he reigned for fifty-five years in
Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hephzibah.

2Ki 21 :2 He did what is displeasing to Yahweh, copying the disgusting practices of the nations whom Yahweh
had dispossessed for the Israelites.

2Ki 21 :3 He rebuilt the high places which his father Hezekiah had destroyed, he set up altars to Baal and made
a sacred pole as Ahab king of Israel had done, he worshipped the whole array of heaven and served it.

2Ki 21 :4 He built altars in the Temple of Yahweh of which Yahweh had said, “Jerusalem is where I shall put my
name”.

2Ki 21:5 He built altars to the whole array of heaven in the two courts of the Temple of Yahweh.

2Ki 21 :6 He caused his son to pass through the fire of sacrifice, he also practised soothsaying and divination
and set up mediums and spirit guides. He did very many more things displeasing to Yahweh, thus provoking his
anger.

2Ki 21:7 He had an image of Asherah carved and placed it inside the Temple of which Yahweh had said to
David and his son Solomon, “In this Temple and in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of
Israel, I shall put my Name for ever.



2Ki 21 :8 Nor shall I ever again set Israel’s footsteps wandering outside the country which I gave to their
ancestors, provided they are careful to observe all I have commanded them as laid down in the whole Law which
my servant Moses prescribed for them”.

2Ki 21 :9 But they would not listen, and Manasseh misled them into doing worse things than the nations whom
Yahweh had destroyed for the Israelites.

2Ki 21:10 Then Yahweh spoke through his servants the prophets as follows,

2Ki 21 :1 1 “Since Manasseh king of Judah has done these shameful deeds, doing more wicked deeds than
anything which the Amorites did before him, and has led Judah too into sin with his idols,

2Ki 21:12 Yahweh, God of Israel, says this, ‘Look, I shall bring such disaster on Jerusalem and Judah as will
make the ears of all who hear of it tingle.

2Ki 21:13 Over Jerusalem I shall stretch the same measuring line as over Samaria, the same plumb-rule as for
the House of Ahab; I shall scour Jerusalem as someöne scours a dish and, having scoured it, turns it upside
down.

2Ki 21:14 I shall cast away the remnant of my heritage, delivering them into the clutches of their enemies and
making them the prey and booty of all their enemies,

2Ki 21:15 because they have done what is displeasing to me and have provoked my anger from the day their
ancestors came out of Egypt until now’”.

2Ki 21:16 Manasseh shed innocent blood, too, in such great quantity that he flooded Jerusalem from one end to
the other, besides the sins into which he led Judah by doing what is displeasing to Yahweh.

2Ki 21:17 The rest of the history of Manasseh, his entire career, the sins he committed, is this not recorded in
the Book of the Annals of the Kings of Judah?

2Ki 21:18 Then Manasseh fell asleep with his ancestors and was buried in the garden of his palace, the Garden
of Uzza; his son Amon succeeded him.

2Ki 21:19 Amon was twenty-two years old when he came to the throne, and he reigned for two years in
Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Meshullemeth daughter of Haruz, of Jotbah.

2Ki 21:20 He did what is displeasing to Yahweh, as Manasseh his father had done.

2Ki 21 :21 In every respect he followed the example of his father, serving the idols which his father had served,

and worshipping them.

2Ki 21 :22 He abandoned Yahweh, God of his ancestors; he did not follow the way of Yahweh.

2Ki 21 :23 Amon’s retinue plotted against the king and killed him in his own palace.

2Ki 21:24 The people of the country, however, slaughtered all those who had plotted against King Amon and
proclaimed his son Josiah as his successor.

2Ki 21 :25 The rest of the history of Amon, his entire career, is this not recorded in the Book of the Annals of the
Kings of Judah?

2Ki 21 :26 He was buried in his father’s tomb in the Garden of Uzza; his son Josiah succeeded him.

2Ki 22:1 Josiah was eight years old when he came to the throne, and he reigned for thirty-one years in
Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jedidah daughter of Adaiah, of Bozkath.

2Ki 22:2 He did what Yahweh regards as right, and in every respect followed the example of his ancestor David,
not deviating from it to right or left.

2Ki 22:3 In the eighteenth year of King Josiah, the king sent the secretary Shaphan son of Azaliah, son of
Meshullam to the Temple of Yahweh.

2Ki 22:4 “Go to Hilkiah the high priest”, he told him, “and tell him to melt down the silver contributed to the
Temple of Yahweh and collected by the guardians of the threshold from the people.

2Ki 22:5 He is to hand it over to the masters of works attached to the Temple of Yahweh, for them to pay it over
to men working on the Temple of Yahweh, to repair the damaged parts of the Temple:

2Ki 22:6 to the carpenters, builders and masons, and for buying timber and dressed stone for the Temple
repairs”.

2Ki 22:7 The latter were not required to render account of the money handed over to them, since they were
conscientious in their work.

2Ki 22:8 The high priest Hilkiah said to Shaphan the secretary, “I have found the Book of the Law in the Temple
of Yahweh”. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, who read it.

2Ki 22:9 Shaphan the secretary went to the king, reporting furthermore to him as follows, “Your servants have
melted down the silver which was in the Temple and have handed it over to the masters of works attached to the
Temple of Yahweh”.

2Ki 22:10 Then Shaphan the secretary informed the king, “The priest Hilkiah has given me a book”; and
Shaphan read it aloud in the king’s presence.

2Ki 22:1 1 On hearing the words of the Book of the Law he tore his clothes.

2Ki 22:12 Then the king gave the following order to the priest Hilkiah, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Achbor son of
Micaiah, Shaphan the secretary and Asaiah the king’s minister:



2Ki 22:13 “Go and consult Yahweh on behalf of me and the people about the words of the book that has been
discovered; for Yahweh’s furious wrath has been kindled against us because our ancestors disobeyed the word
of Yahweh by not doing what this book says they ought to have done”.

2Ki 22:14 The priest Hilkiah, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan and Asaiah went to the prophetess Huldah wife of
Shallum son of Tikvah, son of Harhas the keeper of the wardrobe; she lived in Jerusalem in the new town. They
put the matter to her,

2Ki 22:15 and she replied, “Yahweh, God of Israel, says this, ‘To the man who sent you to me say this:

2Ki 22:16 Yahweh says this: I am going to bring disaster on this place and the people who live in it — all the
words of the book read by the king of Judah.

2Ki 22:1 7 Because they have abandoned me and sacrificed to other gods, so as to provoke my anger by their
every action, my wrath is kindled against this place, and nothing can stop it.

2Ki 22:18 As for the king of Judah who sent you to consult Yahweh, say this to him: As regards the words you
have heard …

2Ki 22:19 But since your heart has been touched and you have humbled yourself before Yahweh on hearing
what I have decreed against this place and the people who live in it, how they will become an object of horror
and cursing, and have torn your clothes and wept before me, I too have heard — Yahweh says this.

2Ki 22:20 So look, when I gather you to your ancestors, you will be gathered into your grave in peace; you will
not live to see the great disaster that I am going to bring on this place’”. They took this answer to the king.

2Ki 23:1 The king then had all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem summoned to him,

2Ki 23:2 and the king went up to the Temple of Yahweh with all the people of Judah and all the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, priests, prophets and the whole populace, high and low. In their hearing he read out the entire
contents of the Book of the Covenant discovered in the Temple of Yahweh.

2Ki 23:3 The king then, standing on the dais, bound himself by the covenant before Yahweh, to follow Yahweh,
to keep his commandments, decrees and laws with all his heart and soul, and to carry out the terms of the
covenant as written in this book. All the people pledged their allegiance to the covenant.

2Ki 23:4 The king ordered Hilkiah with the priest next in rank and the guardians of the threshold to remove all
the cult objects which had been made for Baal, Asherah and the whole array of heaven; he burnt them outside
Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron and had the ashes taken to Bethel.

2Ki 23:5 He exterminated the spurious priests whom the kings of Judah had appointed and who offered sacrifice
on the high places, in the towns of Judah and the neighbourhood of Jerusalem; also those who offered sacrifice
to Baal, to the sun, the moon, the constellations and the whole array of heaven.

2Ki 23:6 And from the Temple of Yahweh he took the sacred pole outside Jerusalem to the Kidron valley and in
the Kidron valley he burnt it, reducing it to ashes and throwing its ashes on the common burial-ground.

2Ki 23:7 He pulled down the house of the sacred male prostitutes which was in the Temple of Yahweh and
where the women wove veils for Asherah.

2Ki 23:8 He brought all the priests in from the towns of Judah, and from Geba to Beersheba he rendered
unsanctified the high places where these priests had offered sacrifice. He pulled down the High Place of the
Gates, which stood at the gate of Joshua, the governor of the city, to the left of the entry to the city.

2Ki 23:9 The priests of the high places, however, did not officiate at the altar of Yahweh in Jerusalem, although
they did share the unleavened bread of their brother-priests.

2Ki 23:10 He rendered unsanctified Tophet in the Valley of Ben-Hinnom, so that no one could pass his son or
daughter through the fire of sacrifice to Molech.

2Ki 23:1 1 He destroyed the horses which the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun at the entrance to the
Temple of Yahweh, near the apartment of Nathan-Melech the official, in the precincts, and he burned the solar
chariot.

2Ki 23:12 The king pulled down altars which the kings of Judah had built on the roof and those which Manasseh
had built in the two courts of the Temple of Yahweh, and broke them to pieces on the spot, throwing their rubble
into the Kidron valley.

2Ki 23:13 The king rendered unsanctified the high places facing Jerusalem, to the south of the Mount of Olives,
which Solomon king of Israel had built for Astarte the Sidonian abomination, for Chemosh the Moabite
abomination, and for Milcom the Ammonite abomination.

2Ki 23:14 He also smashed the sacred pillars, cut down the sacred poles, and covered with human bones the
places where they had stood.

2Ki 23:15 As for the altar which was at Bethel, the high place built by Jeroboam son of Nebat who had led Israel
into sin, he demolished this altar and this high place as well, in the same way, breaking up its stones and
reducing them to powder. The sacred pole he burned.

2Ki 23:16 On looking round, Josiah saw the tombs there on the hillside; he had the bones fetched from the
tombs and burned them on the altar. This he rendered unsanctified, in accordance with the word of Yahweh
which the man of God had proclaimed when Jeroboam was standing by the altar at the time of the feast. On



looking round, Josiah caught sight of the tomb of the man of God who had foretold these things.

2Ki 23:1 7 “What is that monument I see?”. he asked. The townspeople replied, “It is the tomb of the man of God
who came from Judah and foretold what you have done to the altar”.

2Ki 23:18 “Let him rest”, the king said, “and let no one disturb his bones”. So they left his bones untouched, with
the bones of the prophet who came from Samaria.

2Ki 23:19 Josiah also destroyed all the shrines on the high places which were in the towns of Samaria and
which the kings of Israel had built to provoke Yahweh’s anger; he treated these places exactly as he had treated
the one at Bethel.

2Ki 23:20 All the priests of the high places who were there he slaughtered on the altars, and on those altars
burned human bones. Then he returned to Jerusalem.

2Ki 23:21 The king gave this order to the whole people: “Celebrate a Passover to Yahweh your God, as
prescribed in this Book of the Covenant”.

2Ki 23:22 No Passover like this had ever been celebrated since the days when the judges ruled Israel, nor
throughout the entire period of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah.

2Ki 23:23 The eighteenth year of King Josiah was the only time when such a Passover was celebrated in
Yahweh’s honour in Jerusalem.

2Ki 23:24 What is more, the spirit-guides and mediums, the household gods and idols, and all the abominations
to be seen in the country of Judah and in Jerusalem, were swept away by Josiah to give effect to the words of
the Law written in the book found by the priest Hilkiah in the Temple of Yahweh.

2Ki 23:25 No king before him turned to Yahweh as he did, with all his heart, all his soul, all his strength, in
perfect loyalty to the Law of Moses; nor did any king like him arise again.

2Ki 23:26 Yet Yahweh did not renounce the heat of his great anger which had been aroused against Judah by
all the provocations which Manasseh had caused him.

2Ki 23:27 Yahweh said, “I shall thrust Judah away from me too, as I have already thrust Israel; I shall cast off
Jerusalem, this city which I have chosen, and the Temple of which I have said: My Name shall be there”.

2Ki 23:28 The rest of the history of Josiah, his entire career, is this not recorded in the Book of the Annals of the
Kings of Judah?

2Ki 23:29 In his times, Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt was advancing to meet the king of Assyria at the River
Euphrates, and King Josiah went to intercept him; but Necho killed him at Megiddo in the first encounter.

2Ki 23:30 His retainers carried his body from Megiddo by chariot; they brought him to Jerusalem and buried him
in his own tomb. The people of the country then took Jehoahaz son of Josiah and anointed him, proclaiming him
king in succession to his father.

2Ki 23:31 Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he came to the throne, and he reigned for three months in
Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah, of Libnah.

2Ki 23:32 He did what is displeasing to Yahweh, just as his ancestors had done.

2Ki 23:33 Pharaoh Necho put him in chains at Riblah in Hamath, to prevent his reigning any longer in
Jerusalem, and imposed a levy of a hundred talants of silver and ten talants of gold on the country.

2Ki 23:34 Pharaoh Necho then made Eliakim son of Josiah king in succession to Josiah his father, and changed
his name to Jehoiakim. Carrying off Jehoahaz, he took him to Egypt, where he died.

2Ki 23:35 Jehoiakim paid over the silver and gold to Pharaoh, but first had to tax the people of the country
before he could raise the sum which Pharaoh demanded: he levied the silver and gold to be paid over to
Pharaoh Necho from each according to his means.

2Ki 23:36 Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he came to the throne, and he reigned for eleven years in
Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zebidah daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.

2Ki 23:37 He did what is displeasing to Yahweh, just as his ancestors had done.

2Ki 24:1 In his times, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon invaded, and Jehoiakim became his vassal for three
years, but then rebelled against him a second time.

2Ki 24:2 So he sent armed bands of Chaldaeans, Aramaeans, Moabites and Ammonites against him; he sent
these against Judah to destroy it, in accordance with the word which Yahweh had spoken through his servants
the prophets.

2Ki 24:3 It was entirely due to Yahweh’s anger that this happened to Judah; he had resolved to thrust them
away from him because of Manasseh’s sins and all that he had done,

2Ki 24:4 and also because of the innocent blood which he had shed, flooding Jerusalem with innocent blood.
Yahweh would not forgive.

2Ki 24:5 The rest of the history of Jehoiakim, his entire career, is this not recorded in the Book of the Annals of
the Kings of Judah?

2Ki 24:6 Then Jehoiakim fell asleep with his ancestors; his son Jehoiachin succeeded him.

2Ki 24:7 The king of Egypt did not leave his own country again, because the king of Babylon had conquered
everywhere belonging to the king of Egypt, from the Torrent of Egypt to the River Euphrates.



2Ki 24:8 Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he came to the throne, and he reigned for three months in
Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Nehushta daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.

2Ki 24:9 He did what is displeasing to Yahweh, just as his father had done.

2Ki 24:10 At that time the troops of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon advanced on Jerusalem, and the city was
besieged.

2Ki 24:1 1 Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon advanced on the city and his generals laid siege to it.

2Ki 24:12 Jehoiachin king of Judah-he, his mother, his retinue, his nobles and his officials — then surrendered to
the king of Babylon, and the king of Babylon took them prisoner in the eighth year of his reign.

2Ki 24:13 The latter carried off all the treasures of the Temple of Yahweh and the treasures of the palace and
broke up all the golden furnishings which Solomon king of Israel had made for the sanctuary of Yahweh, as
Yahweh had foretold.

2Ki 24:14 He carried all Jerusalem off into exile, all the nobles and all the notables, ten thousand of these were
exiled, with all the blacksmiths and metalworkers; only the poorest people in the country were left behind.

2Ki 24:15 He deported Jehoiachin to Babylon, as also the king’s mother, his officials and the nobility of the
country; he made them all leave Jerusalem for exile in Babylon.

2Ki 24:16 All the men of distinction, seven thousand of them, the blacksmiths and metalworkers, one thousand
of them, all the men capable of bearing arms, were led off into exile in Babylon by the king of Babylon.

2Ki 24:17 The king of Babylon deposed Jehoiachin in favour of his paternal uncle Mattaniah, whose name he
changed to Zedekiah.

2Ki 24:18 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he came to the throne, and he reigned for eleven years in
Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamital daughter of Jeremiah, of Libnah.

2Ki 24:19 He did what is displeasing to Yahweh, just as Jehoiakim had done.

2Ki 24:20 It was entirely due to Yahweh’s anger that this happened to Jerusalem and Judah. It resulted in his
casting them from his presence. Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.

2Ki 25:1 In the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadnezzar king
of Babylon advanced on Jerusalem with his entire army; he pitched camp in front of the city and threw up
earthworks round it.

2Ki 25:2 The city lay under siege till the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.

2Ki 25:3 In the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, when famine was raging in the city and there was
no food for the populace,

2Ki 25:4 a breach was made in the city wall. The king then made his escape under cover of dark, with all the
fighting men, by way of the gate between the two walls, which is near the king’s garden — the Chaldaeans had
surrounded the city — and made his way towards the Arabah.

2Ki 25:5 The Chaldaean troops pursued the king and caught up with him in the Plains of Jericho, where all his
troops deserted.

2Ki 25:6 The Chaldaeans captured the king and took him to the king of Babylon at Riblah, who passed sentence
on him.

2Ki 25:7 He had Zedekiah’s sons slaughtered before his eyes, then put out Zedekiah’s eyes and, loading him
with chains, carried him off to Babylon.

2Ki 25:8 In the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month — it was in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar
king of Babylon — Nebuzaradan commander of the guard, a member of the king of Babylon’s staff, entered
Jerusalem.

2Ki 25:9 He burned down the Temple of Yahweh, the royal palace and all the houses in Jerusalem.

2Ki 25:10 The Chaldaean troops who accompanied the commander of the guard demolished the walls
surrounding Jerusalem.

2Ki 25:1 1 Nebuzaradan commander of the guard deported the remainder of the population left in the city, the
deserters who had gone over to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the common people.

2Ki 25:12 But the commander of the guard left some of the poor country people behind as vineyard workers and
ploughmen.

2Ki 25:13 The Chaldaeans broke up the bronze pillars from the Temple of Yahweh, the wheeled stands and the
bronze Sea, which were in the Temple of Yahweh, and took the bronze away to Babylon.

2Ki 25:14 They also took the ash containers, the scoops, the knives, the incense boats, and all the bronze
furnishings used in worship.

2Ki 25:15 The commander of the guard also took the censers and the sprinkling bowls, everything made of gold
and everything made of silver.

2Ki 25:16 As regards the two pillars, the one Sea and the wheeled stands, which Solomon of bronze in all these
objects.

2Ki 25:1 7 The height of one pillar was eighteen cubits, and on it stood a capital of bronze, the height of the
capital being five cubits; round the capital were filigree and pomegranates, all in bronze. So also for the second



pillar.

2Ki 25:18 The commander of the guard took prisoner Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest next in rank,
and the three guardians of the threshold.

2Ki 25:19 In the city he took prisoner an official who was in command of the fighting men, five of the king’s
personal friends who were discovered in the city, the secretary to the army commander, responsible for military
conscription, and sixty men of distinction discovered in the city.

2Ki 25:20 Nebuzaradan commander of the guard took these men and brought them to the king of Babylon at
Riblah,

2Ki 25:21 and at Riblah in the territory of Hamath the king of Babylon had them put to death. Thus Judah was
deported from its country.

2Ki 25:22 For the people remaining in the country of Judah whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left
behind, he appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan as governor.

2Ki 25:23 When the military leaders and their men all heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah as
governor, they went to him at Mizpah: Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of
Tanhumeth the Netophathite, Jaazaniah the Maacathite, they and their men.

2Ki 25:24 To them and to their men Gedaliah swore an oath. “Do not be afraid of the Chaldaeans”, he said, “stay
in the country, serve the king of Babylon, and all will go well with you”.

2Ki 25:25 But in the seventh month, Ishmael son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, who was of royal descent, and
ten men with him, came and murdered Gedaliah, as well as the Judaeans and Chaldaeans who were with him at
Mizpah.

2Ki 25:26 Then all the people, high and low, with the military leaders, set off and went to Egypt, being afraid of
the Chaldaeans.

2Ki 25:27 In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-
seventh day of the month, Evil-Merodach king of Babylon, in the year he came to the throne, pardoned
Jehoiachin king of Judah and released him from prison.

2Ki 25:28 He treated him with kindness and allotted him a seat above those of the other kings who were with
him in Babylon.

2Ki 25:29 So Jehoiachin laid aside his prisoner’s garb, and for the rest of his life always ate at the king’s table.
2Ki 25:30 And his upkeep was permanently ensured by the king, day after day, for the rest of his life.
