	<span>like the pavilions of Salmah.</span>
	<span>Take no notice of my dark colouring, </span>
	<span>it is the sun that has burnt me. </span>
	<span>My mother’s sons turned their anger on me, </span>

	<span>He has taken me to his cellar, </span>
	<span>and his banner over me is love.</span>
	<span>Feed me with raisin cakes, </span>
	<span>restore me with apples, </span>
	<span>for I am sick with love.</span>

	<span>The mandrakes yield their fragrance, </span>
	<span>the most exquisite fruits are at our doors; </span>
	<span>the new as well as the old, </span>
	<span>I have stored them for you, my love.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem" id="ch8">
	<span>Ah, why are you not my brother, </span>
	<span>nursed at my mother’s breast! </span>
	<span>Then if I met you out of doors, I could kiss you </span>
	<span>without people thinking ill of me.</span>
	<span>I should lead you, I should take you into my mother’s house, and you would teach me! </span>
	<span>I should give you spiced wine to drink, </span>
	<span>juice of my pomegranates.</span>

	<span>His left arm is under my head </span>

	<span class="smc">Lover:</span>
	<span>I charge you, </span>
	<span>daughters of </span>

	<span>before she pleases!</span>

<h2 id="vii">Epilogue (8:5–7)</h2>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Who is this coming up from the desert </span>
	<span>leaning on her lover? </span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>I awakened you under the apple tree, </span>
	<span>where your mother conceived you, </span>
	<span>where she who bore you conceived you.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span class="smc">Beloved:</span>
	<span>Set me like a seal on your heart, </span>
	<span>like a seal on your arm. </span>
	<span>For love is strong as Death,</span>
	<span>passion as relentless as Sheol. </span>
	<span>The flash of it is a flash of fire, </span>
	<span>a flame of Yahweh himself.</span>
	<span>Love no flood can quench, </span>
	<span>no torrents drown. </span>
	<span>Were a man to offer all his family wealth </span>
	<span>to buy love,</span>
	<span>contempt is all that he would gain.</span>

<h4>Two epigrams (8:8–12)</h4>

<p>Our sister is little: her breasts are not yet formed. What shall we do for our sister on the day she is spoken for? If she is a rampart, on the crest we shall build a battlement of silver; if she is a door, we shall board her up with planks of cedar.</p>

<p>I am a wall, and my breasts represent its towers. And under their eyes I have found true peace.</p>

<p>Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-Hamon. He entrusted it to overseers, and each one was to pay him the value of its produce, a thousand shekels of silver. But I tend my own vineyard myself. You, Solomon, may have your thousand shekels, and those who oversee its produce their two hundred.</p>

<h4>Final additions (8:13–14)</h4>

<p>You who dwell in the gardens, my companions listen for your voice; let me hear it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="poem">
	<span>Haste away, my love,</span>
	<span>be like a gazelle,</span>
	<span>a young stag,</span>
	<span>on the spice-laden mountains.</span>
</p>
