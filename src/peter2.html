<h4>Greetings</h4>

<p>
From Simon Peter, servant and apostle of Jesus Christ; to all who treasure the 
same faith as ourselves, given through the righteousness of our God and 
saviour Jesus Christ. May you have more and more grace and peace as you come 
to know our Lord more and more. 
</p>

<h4>A call to Christian living, and its reward</h4>

<p>
By his divine power, he has given us all the things that we need for life and 
for true devotion, bringing us to know God himself, who has called us by his 
own glory and goodness. In making these gifts, he has given us the guarantee 
of something very great and wonderful to come: through them you will be able 
to share the divine nature and to escape corruption in a world that is sunk in 
vice. But to attain this, you will have to do your utmost yourselves, adding 
goodness to the faith that you have, understanding to your goodness, 
self-control to your understanding, patience to your self-control, true 
devotion to your patience, kindness towards your fellow men to your devotion, 
and, to this kindness, love. If you have a generous supply of these, they will 
not leave you ineffectual or unproductive: they will bring you to a real 
knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. But without them a man is blind or else 
short-sighted; he has forgotten how his past sins were washed away. Brothers, 
you have been called and chosen: work all the harder to justify it. If you do 
all these things there is no danger that you will ever fall away. In this way 
you will be granted admittance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and 
saviour Jesus Christ.
</p>

<h4>The apostolic witness</h4>

<p>
That is why I am continually recalling the same truths to you, even though you 
already know them and firmly hold them. I am sure it is my duty, as long as I 
am in this tent, to keep stirring you up with reminders, since I know the time 
for taking off this tent is coming soon, as our Lord Jesus Christ foretold to 
me. And I shall take great care that after my own departure you will still 
have a means to recall these things to memory. 
</p>

<p>
It was not any cleverly invented myths that we were repeating when we brought 
you the knowledge of the power and the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ; we had 
seen his majesty for ourselves. He was honoured and glorified by God the 
Father, when the Sublime Glory itself spoke to him and said, “This is my Son, 
the Beloved; he enjoys my favour”. We heard this ourselves, spoken from 
heaven, when we were with him on the holy mountain.
</p>

<h4>The value of prophecy</h4>

<p>
So we have confirmation of what was said in prophecies; and you will be right 
to depend on prophecy and take it as a lamp for lighting a way through the 
dark until the dawn comes and the morning star rises in your minds. At the 
same time, we must be most careful to remember that the interpretation of 
scriptural prophecy is never a matter for the individual. Why? Because no 
prophecy ever came from man’s initiative. When men spoke for God it was the 
Holy Spirit that moved them. 
</p>

<h4>False teachers</h4>

<p>
As there were false prophets in the past history of our people, so you too 
will have your false teachers, who will insinuate their own disruptive views 
and disown the Master who purchased their freedom. They will destroy 
themselves very quickly; but there will be many who copy their shameful 
behaviour and the Way of Truth will be brought into disrepute on their 
account. They will eagerly try to buy you for themselves with insidious 
speeches, but for them the Condemnation, pronounced so long ago, is at its 
work already, and Destruction is not asleep. When angels sinned, God did not 
spare them: he sent them down to the underworld and consigned them to the dark 
underground caves to be held there until the day of Judgement. Nor did he 
spare the world in ancient times: it was only Noah he saved, the preacher of 
righteousness, along with seven others, when he sent the Flood over a 
disobedient world. The cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, these too he condemned 
and reduced to ashes; he destroyed them completely, as a warning to anybody 
lacking reverence in the future; he rescued Lot, however, a holy man who had 
been sickened by the shameless way in which these vile people behaved — for 
that holy man, living among them, was outraged in his good soul by the crimes 
that he saw and heard of every day. These are all examples of how the Lord can 
rescue the good from the ordeal, and hold the wicked for their punishment 
until the day of Judgement, especially those who are governed by their corrupt 
bodily desires and have no respect for authority.
</p>

<h4>The punishment to come</h4>

<p>
Such self-willed people with no reverence are not afraid of offending against 
the glorious ones, but the angels in their greater strength and power make no 
complaint or accusation against them in front of the Lord. All the same, these 
people who only insult anything that they do not understand are not reasoning 
beings, but simply animals born to be caught and killed, and they will quite 
certainly destroy themselves by their own work of destruction, and get their 
reward of evil for the evil that they do. They are unsightly blots on your 
society: men whose only object is dissipation all day long, and they amuse 
themselves deceiving you even when they are your guests at a meal; with their 
eyes always looking for adultery, men with an infinite capacity for sinning, 
they will seduce any soul which is at all unstable. Greed is the one lesson 
their minds have learnt. They are under a curse. They have left the right path 
and wandered off to follow the path of Balaam son of Beor, who thought he 
could profit best by sinning, until he was called to order for his faults. The 
dumb donkey put a stop to that prophet’s madness when it talked like a man. 
People like this are dried-up rivers, fogs swirling in the wind, and the dark 
underworld is the place reserved for them. With their high-flown talk, which 
is all hollow, they tempt back the ones who have only just escaped from 
paganism, playing on their bodily desires with debaucheries. They may promise 
freedom but they themselves are slaves, slaves to corruption; because if 
anyone lets himself be dominated by anything, then he is a slave to it; and 
anyone who has escaped the pollution of the world once by coming to know our 
Lord and saviour Jesus Christ, and who then allows himself to be entangled by 
it a second time and mastered, will end up in a worse state than he began in. 
It would even have been better for him never to have learnt the way of 
holiness, than to know it and afterwards desert the holy rule that was 
entrusted to him. What he has done is exactly as the proverb rightly says: The 
dog goes back to his own vomit, and: When the sow has been washed, it wallows 
in the mud.
</p>

<h4>The Day of the Lord; the prophets and the apostles</h4>

<p>
My friends, this is my second letter to you, and in both of them I have tried 
to awaken a true understanding in you by giving you a reminder: recalling to 
you what was said in the past by the holy prophets and the commandments of the 
Lord and saviour which you were given by the apostles.
</p>

<p>
We must be careful to remember that during the last days there are bound to be 
people who will be scornful, the kind who always please themselves what they 
do, and they will make fun of the promise and ask, “Well, where is this 
coming? Everything goes on as it has since the Fathers died, as it has since 
it began at the creation”. They are choosing to forget that there were heavens 
at the beginning, and that the earth was formed by the word of God out of 
water and between the waters, so that the world of that time was destroyed by 
being flooded by water. But by the same word, the present sky and earth are 
destined for fire, and are only being reserved until Judgement day so that all 
sinners may be destroyed. 
</p>

<p>
But there is one thing, my friends, that you must never forget: that with the 
Lord, a day can mean a thousand years, and a thousand years is like a day. The 
Lord is not being slow to carry out his promises, as anybody else might be 
called slow; but he is being patient with you all, wanting nobody to be lost 
and everybody to be brought to change his ways. The Day of the Lord will come 
like a thief, and then with a roar the sky will vanish, the elements will 
catch fire and fall apart, the earth and all that it contains will be burnt 
up. 
</p>

<h4>Conclusion and doxology</h4>

<p>
Since everything is coming to an end like this, you should be living holy and 
saintly lives while you wait and long for the Day of God to come, when the sky 
dissolve in flames and the elements melt in the heat. What we are waiting for 
is what he promised: the new heavens and new earth, the place where 
righteousness will be at home. So then, my friends, while you are waiting, do 
your best to live lives without spot or stain so that he will find you at 
peace. Think of our Lord’s patience as your opportunity to be saved: our 
brother Paul, who is so dear to us, told you this when he wrote to you with 
the wisdom that is his special gift. He always writes like this when he deals 
with this sort of subject, and this makes some points in his letter hard to 
understand; these are the points that uneducated and unbalanced people 
distort, in the same way as they distort the rest of scripture — a fatal thing 
for them to do. You have been warned about this, my friends; be careful not to 
get carried away by the errors of unprincipled people, from the firm ground 
that you are standing on. Instead, go on growing in the grace and in the 
knowledge of our Lord and saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory, in time and 
in eternity. Amen.
</p>
