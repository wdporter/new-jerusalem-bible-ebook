<h2 id="i">First Lamentation (1:1–22)</h2>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>How deserted she sits,</span>
	<span class="i1">the city once thronged with people!</span>
	<span>Once the greatest of nations,</span>
	<span class="i1">she is now like a widow.</span>
	<span>Once the princess of states,</span>
	<span class="i1">she is now put to forced labour.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>All night long she is weeping,</span>
	<span class="i1">tears running down her cheeks.</span>
	<span>Not one of all her lovers</span>
	<span class="i1">remains to comfort her.</span>
	<span>Her friends have all betrayed her</span>
	<span class="i1">and become her enemies.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>Judah has gone into exile</span>
	<span class="i1">after much pain and toil.</span>
	<span>Living among the nations</span>
	<span class="i1">she finds no respite;</span>
	<span>her persecutors all overtake her</span>
	<span class="i1">where there is no way out.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>The roads to Zion are in mourning;</span>
	<span class="i1">no one comes to her festivals now.</span>
	<span>Her gateways are all deserted;</span>
	<span class="i1">her priests groan;</span>
	<span>her young girls are grief-stricken;</span>
	<span class="i1">she suffers bitterly.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>Her foes now have the upper hand,</span>
	<span class="i1">her enemies prosper,</span>
	<span>for Yahweh has made her suffer</span>
	<span class="i1">for her many, many crimes;</span>
	<span>her children have gone away into captivity</span>
	<span class="i1">driven in front of the oppressor.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>And from the daughter of Zion</span>
	<span class="i1">all her splendour has departed.</span>
	<span>Her princes were like stags</span>
	<span class="i1">which could find no pasture,</span>
	<span>exhausted, as they flee</span>
	<span class="i1">before the hunter.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>Jerusalem remembers</span>
	<span class="i1">her days of misery and distress;</span>
	<span>when her people fell into the enemy’s clutches</span>
	<span class="i1">there was no one to help her.</span>
	<span>Her enemies looked on</span>
	<span class="i1">and laughed at her downfall.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>Jerusalem has sinned so gravely</span>
	<span class="i1">that she has become a thing unclean.</span>
	<span>All who used to honour her despise her,</span>
	<span class="i1">having seen her nakedness;</span>
	<span>she herself groans aloud</span>
	<span class="i1">and turns her face away.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>Her filth befouls her skirts —</span>
	<span class="i1">she never thought to end like this,</span>
	<span>and hence her astonishing fall</span>
	<span class="i1">with no one to comfort her.</span>
	<span>Yahweh, look at my misery,</span>
	<span class="i1">for the enemy is triumphant!</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>The enemy stretched out his hand</span>
	<span class="i1">for everything she treasured;</span>
	<span>she saw the heathen</span>
	<span class="i1">enter her sanctuary,</span>
	<span>whom you had forbidden</span>
	<span class="i1">to enter your Assembly.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>All her people are groaning,</span>
	<span class="i1">looking for something to eat;</span>
	<span>they have bartered their treasures for food,</span>
	<span class="i1">to keep themselves alive.</span>
	<span>Look, Yahweh, and consider</span>
	<span class="i1">how despised I am!</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>“All you who pass this way,</span>
	<span class="i1">look and see:</span>
	<span>is any sorrow like the sorrow</span>
	<span class="i1">inflicted on me,</span>
	<span>with which Yahweh struck me</span>
	<span class="i1">on the day of his burning anger?</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>“He sent fire from on high</span>
	<span class="i1">deep into my bones;</span>
	<span>he stretched a net for my feet,</span>
	<span class="i1">he pulled me back;</span>
	<span>he left me shattered,</span>
	<span class="i1">sick all day long.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>“He has watched out for my offences,</span>
	<span class="i1">with his hand he enmeshes me,</span>
	<span>his yoke is on my neck,</span>
	<span class="i1">he has deprived me of strength.</span>
	<span>The Lord has put me into clutches</span>
	<span class="i1">which I am helpless to resist.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>“The Lord has rejected</span>
	<span class="i1">all my warriors within my walls,</span>
	<span>he has summoned a host against me</span>
	<span class="i1">to crush my young men;</span>
	<span>in the winepress the Lord trampled</span>
	<span class="i1">the young daughter of Judah.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>“And that is why I weep;</span>
	<span class="i1">my eyes stream with water,</span>
	<span>since a comforter who could revive me</span>
	<span class="i1">is far away.</span>
	<span>My children are shattered,</span>
	<span class="i1">for the enemy has proved too strong.”</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>Zion stretches out her hands,</span>
	<span class="i1">with no one to comfort her.</span>
	<span>Yahweh has commanded Jacob’s enemies</span>
	<span class="i1">to surround him;</span>
	<span>they treat Jerusalem</span>
	<span class="i1">as though she were unclean.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>“Yahweh is in the right,</span>
	<span class="i1">for I rebelled against his command.</span>
	<span>Listen, all you peoples,</span>
	<span class="i1">and see my sorrow.</span>
	<span>My young girls and my young men</span>
	<span class="i1">have gone into captivity.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>“I called to my lovers;</span>
	<span class="i1">they failed me.</span>
	<span>My priests and my elders</span>
	<span class="i1">expired in the city,</span>
	<span>as they searched for food</span>
	<span class="i1">to keep themselves alive.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>“Look, Yahweh. I am in distress!</span>
	<span class="i1">My inmost being is in ferment;</span>
	<span>my heart turns over inside me —</span>
	<span class="i1">how rebellious I have been!</span>
	<span>Outside, the sword bereaves;</span>
	<span class="i1">inside it is like death.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>“Listen, for I am groaning,</span>
	<span class="i1">with no one to comfort me.</span>
	<span>All my enemies have heard of my disaster,</span>
	<span class="i1">they are glad about what you have done.</span>
	<span>Bring the Day you once foretold,</span>
	<span class="i1">so that they may be like me!</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>“Let all their wickedness come before you,</span>
	<span class="i1">and treat them</span>
	<span>as you have treated me</span>
	<span class="i1">for all my crimes;</span>
	<span>numberless are my groans,</span>
	<span class="i1">and I am sick at heart.”</span>
</p>

<h2 id="ii">Second Lamentation (2:1–22)</h2>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>In his anger, with what darkness</span>
	<span class="i1">has the Lord enveloped the daughter of Zion!</span>
	<span>He has flung the beauty of Israel</span>
	<span class="i1">from heaven to the ground,</span>
	<span>without regard for his footstool</span>
	<span class="i1">on the day of his anger.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>The Lord pitilessly engulfed</span>
	<span class="i1">all the homes of Jacob;</span>
	<span>in his fury he tore down</span>
	<span class="i1">the fortresses of the daughter of Judah;</span>
	<span>he threw to the ground, he desecrated</span>
	<span class="i1">the kingdom and its princes.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>In his burning anger</span>
	<span class="i1">he broke all the might of Israel,</span>
	<span>withdrew his protecting right hand</span>
	<span class="i1">at the coming of the enemy,</span>
	<span>and blazed against Jacob like a fire</span>
	<span class="i1">that burns up everything near it.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>Like an enemy he bent his bow,</span>
	<span class="i1">and his right hand held firm;</span>
	<span>like a foe he slaughtered</span>
	<span class="i1">all those who were a delight to see;</span>
	<span>on the tent of the daughter of Zion</span>
	<span class="i1">he poured out his fury like fire.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>The Lord behaved like an enemy;</span>
	<span class="i1">he engulfed Israel,</span>
	<span>he engulfed all its citadels,</span>
	<span class="i1">he destroyed its fortresses</span>
	<span>and for the daughter of Judah</span>
	<span class="i1">multiplied weeping on wailing.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>He wrecked his domain like a garden,</span>
	<span class="i1">destroyed his assembly-points,</span>
	<span>Yahweh erased the memory</span>
	<span class="i1">of festivals and Sabbaths in Zion;</span>
	<span>in the heat of his anger he treated</span>
	<span class="i1">king and priest with contempt.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>The Lord has rejected his altar,</span>
	<span class="i1">he has come to loathe his sanctuary</span>
	<span>and has given her palace walls</span>
	<span class="i1">into the clutches of the enemy;</span>
	<span>from the uproar they made in Yahweh’s temple</span>
	<span class="i1">it might have been a festival day!</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>Yahweh has resolved to destroy</span>
	<span class="i1">the walls of the daughter of Zion,</span>
	<span>stretching out the line, not staying his hand</span>
	<span class="i1">until he has engulfed everything,</span>
	<span>thus bringing mourning on wall and rampart;</span>
	<span class="i1">alike they crumbled.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>Her gates have sunk into the ground;</span>
	<span class="i1">he has broken and shattered their bars.</span>
	<span>Her king and her princes are among the gentiles,</span>
	<span class="i1">there is no instruction,</span>
	<span>furthermore her prophets cannot find</span>
	<span class="i1">any vision from Yahweh.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>Mute, they sit on the ground,</span>
	<span class="i1">the elders of the daughter of Zion;</span>
	<span>they have put dust on their heads</span>
	<span class="i1">and wrapped themselves in sackcloth.</span>
	<span>The young girls of Jerusalem bow their heads</span>
	<span class="i1">to the ground.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>My eyes are worn out with weeping,</span>
	<span class="i1">my inmost being is in ferment,</span>
	<span>my heart plummets</span>
	<span class="i1">at the destruction of my young people,</span>
	<span>as the children and babies grow faint</span>
	<span class="i1">in the streets of the city.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>They keep saying to their mothers,</span>
	<span class="i1">“Where is some food?”,</span>
	<span>as they faint like wounded men</span>
	<span class="i1">in the streets of the city,</span>
	<span>as they breathe their last</span>
	<span class="i1">on their mothers’ breasts.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>To what can I compare or liken you,</span>
	<span class="i1">daughter of Jerusalem?</span>
	<span>Who can rescue and comfort you,</span>
	<span class="i1">young daughter of Zion?</span>
	<span>For huge as the sea is your ruin:</span>
	<span class="i1">who can heal you?</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>The visions your prophets had for you</span>
	<span class="i1">were deceptive whitewash;</span>
	<span>they did not lay bare your guilt</span>
	<span class="i1">so as to change your fortunes:</span>
	<span>the visions they told you</span>
	<span class="i1">were deceptive.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>All who pass your way</span>
	<span class="i1">clap their hands at the sight;</span>
	<span>they whistle and shake their heads</span>
	<span class="i1">over the daughter of Jerusalem,</span>
	<span>“Is this the city they call Perfection of Beauty,</span>
	<span class="i1">the joy of the whole world?”.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>Your enemies open their mouths</span>
	<span class="i1">in chorus against you;</span>
	<span>they whistle and grind their teeth;</span>
	<span class="i1">they say, “We have swallowed her up.</span>
	<span>This is the day we were waiting for;</span>
	<span class="i1">at last we have seen it!”.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>Yahweh has done what he planned,</span>
	<span class="i1">has carried out his threat,</span>
	<span>as he ordained long ago:</span>
	<span class="i1">he has destroyed without pity,</span>
	<span>increasing the might of your foes —</span>
	<span class="i1">and letting your foes get the credit.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>Cry then to the Lord,</span>
	<span class="i1">rampart of the daughter of Zion;</span>
	<span>let your tears flow like a torrent,</span>
	<span class="i1">day and night;</span>
	<span>allow yourself no respite,</span>
	<span class="i1">give your eyes no rest!</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>Up, cry out in the night-time</span>
	<span class="i1">as each watch begins!</span>
	<span>Pour your heart out like water</span>
	<span class="i1">in Yahweh’s presence!</span>
	<span>Raise your hands to him</span>
	<span class="i1">for the lives of your children</span>
	<span>(who faint with hunger</span>
	<span class="i1">at the end of every street)!</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>“Look, Yahweh, and consider:</span>
	<span class="i1">whom have you ever treated like this?</span>
	<span>Should women eat their little ones,</span>
	<span class="i1">the children they have nursed?</span>
	<span>Should priest and prophet be slaughtered</span>
	<span class="i1">in the Lord’s sanctuary?</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>“Children and old people are lying</span>
	<span class="i1">on the ground in the streets;</span>
	<span>my young men and young girls</span>
	<span class="i1">have fallen by the sword;</span>
	<span>you have killed them, on the day of your anger,</span>
	<span class="i1">you have slaughtered them pitilessly.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>As though to a festival you called together</span>
	<span class="i1">terrors from all sides,</span>
	<span>so that, on the day of Yahweh’s anger,</span>
	<span class="i1">none escaped and none survived.</span>
	<span>Those whom I had nursed and reared,</span>
	<span class="i1">my enemy has annihilated them all.</span>
</p>

<h2 id="iii">Third Lamentation (3:1–66)</h2>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>I am the man familiar with misery</span>
	<span class="i1">under the rod of his fury.</span>
	<span>He has led and guided me</span>
	<span class="i1">into darkness, not light.</span>
	<span>Against none but me does he turn his hand,</span>
	<span class="i1">again and again, all day.</span>
</p>


<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>He has wasted my flesh and skin away,</span>
	<span class="i1">has broken my bones.</span>
	<span>He has besieged me and made hardship</span>
	<span class="i1">a circlet around my head.</span>
	<span>He has forced me to dwell where all is dark,</span>
	<span class="i1">like those long-dead in their everlasting home.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>He has walled me in so that I cannot escape;</span>
	<span class="i1">he has weighed me down with chains;</span>
	<span>even when I shout for help,</span>
	<span class="i1">he shuts out my prayer.</span>
	<span>He has closed my way with blocks of stone,</span>
	<span class="i1">he has obstructed my paths.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>For me he is a lurking bear,</span>
	<span class="i1">a lion in hiding.</span>
	<span>Heading me off, he has torn me apart,</span>
	<span class="i1">leaving me shattered.</span>
	<span>He has bent his bow and used me</span>
	<span class="i1">as a target for his arrows.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>He has shot deep into me</span>
	<span class="i1">with shafts from his quiver.</span>
	<span>I have become a joke to all my own people,</span>
	<span class="i1">their refrain all day long.</span>
	<span>He has given me my fill of bitterness,</span>
	<span class="i1">he has made me drunk with wormwood.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>He has broken my teeth with gravel,</span>
	<span class="i1">he has fed me on ashes.</span>
	<span>I have been deprived of peace,</span>
	<span class="i1">I have forgotten what happiness is</span>
	<span>and thought, “My lasting hope</span>
	<span class="i1">in Yahweh is lost”.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>Bring to mind my misery and anguish;</span>
	<span class="i1">it is wormwood and gall!</span>
	<span>My heart dwells on this continually</span>
	<span class="i1">and sinks within me.</span>
	<span>This is what I shall keep in mind</span>
	<span class="i1">and so regain some hope:</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>Surely Yahweh’s mercies are not over,</span>
	<span class="i1">his deeds of faithful love not exhausted;</span>
	<span>every morning they are renewed;</span>
	<span class="i1">great is his faithfulness!</span>
	<span>“Yahweh is all I have”, I say to myself,</span>
	<span class="i1">“and so I shall put my hope in him”.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>Yahweh is good to those who trust him,</span>
	<span class="i1">to all who search for him.</span>
	<span>It is good to wait in silence</span>
	<span class="i1">for Yahweh to save.</span>
	<span>It is good for someöne to bear the yoke</span>
	<span class="i1">from a young age,</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>to sit in solitude and silence</span>
	<span class="i1">when it weighs heavy,</span>

	<span class="i1">maybe there is hope —</span>
	<span>to offer one’s cheek to the striker,</span>
	<span class="i1">to have one’s fill of disgrace!</span>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>For the Lord will not reject</span>
	<span class="i1">anyone for ever.</span>

	<span>for it is not for his own pleasure</span>
	<span class="i1">that he torments and grieves the human race.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>When all the prisoners in a country</span>

	<span>Why then should anyone complain?</span>
	<span class="i1">Better to be bold against one’s sins.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>Let us examine our path, let us ponder it</span>

	<span>We are the ones who have sinned, who have rebelled,</span>

</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>You have enveloped us in anger,</span>

	<span>You have wrapped yourself in a cloud</span>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>Our enemies open their mouths</span>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>My eyes will weep ceaselessly,</span>

</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>Unprovoked, my enemies</span>

	<span>You have seen their vindictiveness,</span>
	<span class="i1">all their plots against me.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>You have heard their insults, Yahweh,</span>
	<span class="i1">all their plots against me,</span>
	<span>the whispering and murmuring of my enemies</span>
	<span class="i1">against me all day long.</span>
	<span>Look, whether they sit or stand,</span>
	<span class="i1">I am their refrain.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>Yahweh, repay them</span>
	<span class="i1">as their deeds deserve.</span>
	<span>Lay hardness of heart</span>
	<span class="i1">as your curse on them.</span>
	<span>Angrily pursue them, root them out</span>
	<span class="i1">from under your heavens!</span>

<h3 id="iv">Fourth Lamentation (4:1–22)</h3>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>How the gold has tarnished,</span>
	<span class="i1">how the fine gold has changed!</span>
	<span>The sacred stones lie scattered</span>
	<span class="i1">at the corner of every street.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>The children of Zion,</span>
	<span class="i1">as precious as finest gold —</span>
	<span>to think that they should now be reckoned</span>
	<span class="i1">like crockery made by a potter!</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>The very jackals give the breast,</span>
	<span class="i1">and suckle their young:</span>
	<span>but the daughter of my people is as cruel</span>
	<span class="i1">as the ostriches of the desert.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>The tongue of the baby at the breast</span>
	<span class="i1">sticks to its palate for thirst;</span>
	<span>little children ask for bread,</span>
	<span class="i1">no one gives them any.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>Those who used to eat only the best,</span>
	<span class="i1">now lie dying in the streets;</span>
	<span>those who were reared in the purple</span>
	<span class="i1">claw at the rubbish heaps,</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>for the wickedness of the daughter of my people</span>
	<span class="i1">exceeded the sins of Sodom,</span>
	<span>which was overthrown in a moment</span>
	<span class="i1">without a hand being laid on it.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>Once her young people were brighter than snow,</span>
	<span class="i1">whiter than milk;</span>
	<span>rosier than coral their bodies,</span>
	<span class="i1">their hue like sapphire.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>Now their faces are blacker than soot,</span>
	<span class="i1">they are not recognised in the streets,</span>
	<span>the skin has shrunk over their bones,</span>
	<span class="i1">as dry as a stick.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>Happier those killed by the sword</span>
	<span class="i1">than those killed by famine:</span>
	<span>they waste away, sunken</span>
	<span class="i1">for lack of the fruits of the earth.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>With their own hands, kindly women</span>
	<span class="i1">cooked their children;</span>
	<span>this was their food</span>

</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>Yahweh indulged his fury,</span>
	<span class="i1">he vented his fierce anger,</span>
	<span>he lit a fire in Zion</span>
	<span class="i1">which devoured her foundations.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>The kings of the earth never believed,</span>

	<span>that foe or enemy would ever penetrate</span>
	<span class="i1">the gates of Jerusalem.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>Owing to the sins of her prophets</span>
	<span class="i1">and the crimes of her priests,</span>
	<span>who had shed the blood of the upright,</span>
	<span class="i1">in the heart of the city,</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>they wandered blindly through the streets,</span>
	<span class="i1">polluted with blood,</span>
	<span>so that no one dared</span>
	<span class="i1">to touch their clothes.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>“Keep away! Unclean!”, people shouted,</span>
	<span class="i1">“Keep away! Keep away! Don’t touch!”.</span>
	<span>If they left and fled to the nations,</span>
	<span class="i1">they were not allowed to stay there either.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>The face of Yahweh destroyed them,</span>
	<span class="i1">he will look on them no more.</span>
	<span>There was no respect for the priests,</span>
	<span class="i1">no deference for the elders.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>Continually we were wearing out our eyes,</span>
	<span class="i1">watching for help — in vain.</span>
	<span>From our towers we watched for a nation</span>
	<span class="i1">which could not save us anyway.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>Men dogged our steps,</span>
	<span class="i1">to keep us out of our streets.</span>
	<span>Our end was near, our days were done,</span>
	<span class="i1">our end had come.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>Our pursuers were swifter</span>
	<span class="i1">than eagles in the sky;</span>
	<span>they hounded our steps through the mountains,</span>
	<span class="i1">they lay in ambush for us in the wilds.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>The breath of our nostrils, Yahweh’s anointed,</span>
	<span class="i1">was caught in their traps,</span>
	<span>he of whom we said,</span>
	<span class="i1">“In his shadow</span>
	<span>we shall live among the nations”.</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>Rejoice, exult, daughter of Edom,</span>
	<span class="i1">you who reside in Uz!</span>
	<span>To you in turn the cup will pass;</span>
	<span class="i1">you will get drunk and strip yourself naked!</span>
</p>

<p class="poem alphabet">
	<span>Your wickedness is atoned for, daughter of Zion,</span>
	<span class="i1">he will never banish you again.</span>
	<span>But your wickedness, daughter of Edom,</span>
	<span class="i1">will he punish, your sins he will lay bare!</span>
