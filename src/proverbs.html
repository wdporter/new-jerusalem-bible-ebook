<h3>Commendation of Wisdom</h3>

<h4>The sage speaks: avoid bad company (1:8–19)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Listen, my child, to your father’s instruction, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not reject your mother’s teaching:</span><br />
	<span>they will be a crown of grace for your head, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">a circlet for your neck.</span><br />
	<span>My child, if sinners try to seduce you, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not go with them.</span><br />
	<span>If they say, “Come with us: </span><br />
	<span class="i1">let us lie in ambush to shed blood; </span><br />
	<span class="i1">if we plan an ambush for the innocent without provocation,</span><br />
	<span>we can swallow them alive, like Sheol, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and whole, like those who sink into oblivion.</span><br />
	<span>We shall find treasures of every sort, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">we shall fill our houses with plunder;</span><br />
	<span>throw in your lot with us: </span><br />
	<span class="i1">one purse between us all”.</span><br />
	<span>My child, do not follow them in their way, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">keep your steps out of their path</span><br />
	<span>for their feet hasten to evil, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">they are quick to shed blood;</span><br />
	<span>for the net is spread in vain </span><br />
	<span class="i1">if any winged creature can see it.</span><br />
	<span>It is for their own blood such people lie in wait, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">their ambush is against their own selves!</span><br />
	<span>Such are the paths of all who seek dishonest gain: </span><br />
	<span class="i1">which robs of their lives all who take it for their own.</span><br />
</p>

<h4>Wisdom speaks: a warning to the heedless (1:20:33)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Wisdom calls aloud in the streets, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">she raises her voice in the public squares;</span><br />
	<span>she calls out at the street corners, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">she delivers her message at the city gates.</span><br />
	<span>“You simple people, how much longer will you cling </span><br />
	<span class="i1">to your simple ways? </span><br />
	<span>How much longer will mockers revel in their mocking </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and fools go on hating knowledge?</span><br />
	<span>Pay attention to my warning. </span><br />
	<span class="i1">To you I will pour out my heart </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and tell you what I have to say.</span><br />
	<span>Since I have called and you have refused me, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">since I have beckoned and no one has taken notice,</span><br />
	<span>since you have ignored all my advice </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and rejected all my warnings,</span><br />
	<span>I, for my part, shall laugh at your distress, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">I shall jeer when terror befalls you,</span><br />
	<span>when terror befalls you, like a storm, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">when your distress arrives, like a whirlwind, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">when ordeal and anguish bear down on you.</span><br />
	<span>Then they will call me, but I shall not answer, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">they will look eagerly for me and will not find me.</span><br />
	<span>They have hated knowledge, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">they have not chosen the fear of Yahweh,</span><br />
	<span>they have taken no notice of my advice, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">they have spurned all my warnings:</span><br />
	<span>so they will have to eat the fruits of their own ways of life, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and choke themselves with their own scheming.</span><br />
	<span>For the errors of the simple lead to their death, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">the complacency of fools works their own ruin;</span><br />
	<span>but whoëver listens to me may live secure, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">will have quiet, fearing no mischance”.</span><br />
</p>

<h4>Wisdom, a safeguard against bad company (2:1–22)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>My child, if you take my words to heart, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">if you set store by my commandments,</span><br />
	<span>tuning your ear to wisdom, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">tuning your heart to understanding,</span><br />
	<span>yes, if your plea is for clear perception, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">if you cry out for understanding,</span><br />
	<span>if you look for it as though for silver, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">search for it as though for buried treasure,</span><br />
	<span>then you will understand what the fear of Yahweh is, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and discover the knowledge of God.</span><br />
	<span>For Yahweh himself is giver of wisdom, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">from his mouth issue knowledge and understanding.</span><br />
	<span>He reserves his advice for the honest, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">a shield to those whose ways are sound;</span><br />
	<span>he stands guard over the paths of equity, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">he keeps watch over the way of those faithful to him.</span><br />
	<span>Then you will understand uprightness, equity and fair dealing, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">the paths that lead to happiness.</span><br />
	<span>When wisdom comes into your heart </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and knowledge fills your soul with delight,</span><br />
	<span>then prudence will be there to watch over you, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and understanding will be your guardian</span><br />
	<span>to keep you from the way that is evil, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">from those whose speech is deceitful,</span><br />
	<span>from those who leave the paths of honesty </span><br />
	<span class="i1">to walk the roads of darkness:</span><br />
	<span>those who find their joy in doing wrong, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and their delight in deceitfulness,</span><br />
	<span>whose tracks are twisted, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the paths that they tread crooked.</span><br />
	<span>To keep you, too, from the woman who belongs to another, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">from the stranger, with her wheedling words;</span><br />
	<span>she has left the partner of her younger days, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">she has forgotten the covenant of her God;</span><br />
	<span>her house is tilting towards Death, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">down to the Shades go her paths.</span><br />
	<span>Of those who go to her not one returns, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">they never regain the paths of life.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Thus you will tread the way of good people, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">persisting in the paths of the upright.</span><br />
	<span>For the land will be for the honest to live in, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">the innocent will have it for their home;</span><br />
	<span>while the wicked will be cut off from the land, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the faithless rooted out of it.</span><br />
</p>

<h4>How to acquire wisdom (3:1–12)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>My child, do not forget my teaching, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">let your heart keep my principles,</span><br />
	<span>since they will increase your length of days, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">your years of life and your well-being.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Let faithful love and constancy never leave you: </span><br />
	<span class="i1">tie them around your neck, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">write them on the tablet of your heart.</span><br />
	<span>Thus you will find favour and success </span><br />
	<span class="i1">in the sight of God and of people.</span><br />
	<span>Trust wholeheartedly in Yahweh, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">put no faith in your own perception;</span><br />
	<span>acknowledge him in every course you take, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and he will see that your paths are smooth.</span><br />
	<span>Do not congratulate yourself on your own wisdom, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">fear Yahweh and turn your back on evil:</span><br />
	<span>health-giving, this, to your body, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">relief to your bones.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Honour Yahweh with what goods you have </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and with the first-fruits of all your produce;</span><br />
	<span>then your barns will be filled with corn, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">your vats overflowing with new wine.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>My child, do not scorn correction from Yahweh, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not resent his reproof;</span><br />
	<span>for Yahweh reproves those he loves, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">as a father the child whom he loves.</span><br />
</p>

<h4>The joys of wisdom (3:13–35)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Blessed are those who have discovered wisdom, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">those who have acquired understanding!</span><br />
	<span>Gaining her is more rewarding than silver, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">her yield is more valuable than gold.</span><br />
	<span>She is beyond the price of pearls, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">nothing you could covet is her equal.</span><br />
	<span>In her right hand is length of days; </span><br />
	<span class="i1">in her left hand, riches and honour.</span><br />
	<span>Her ways are filled with delight, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">her paths all lead to contentment.</span><br />
	<span>She is a tree of life for those who hold her fast, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">those who cling to her live happy lives.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>In wisdom, Yahweh laid the earth’s foundations, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">in understanding he spread out the heavens.</span><br />
	<span>Through his knowledge the depths were cleft open, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the clouds distil the dew.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>My child, hold to sound advice and prudence, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">never let them out of sight;</span><br />
	<span>they will give life to your soul </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and beauty to your neck.</span><br />
	<span>You will go on your way in safety, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">your feet will not stumble.</span><br />
	<span>When you go to bed, you will not be afraid; </span><br />
	<span class="i1">once in bed, your sleep will be sweet.</span><br />
	<span>Have no fear either of sudden terror </span><br />
	<span class="i1">or of attack mounted by wicked men,</span><br />
	<span>since Yahweh will be your guarantor, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">he will keep your steps from the snare.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Refuse no kindness to those who have a right to it, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">if it is in your power to perform it.</span><br />
	<span>Do not say to your neighbour, “Go away! Come another time! </span><br />
	<span class="i1">I will give it you tomorrow,’ if you can do it now.</span><br />
	<span>Do not plot harm against your neighbour </span><br />
	<span class="i1">who is living unsuspecting beside you.</span><br />
	<span>Do not pick a groundless quarrel with anyone </span><br />
	<span class="i1">who has done you no harm.</span><br />
	<span>Do not envy the man of violence, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">never model your conduct on his;</span><br />
	<span>for the wilful wrong-doer is abhorrent to Yahweh, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">who confides only in the honest.</span><br />
	<span>Yahweh’s curse lies on the house of the wicked, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">but he blesses the home of the upright.</span><br />
	<span>He mocks those who mock, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">but accords his favour to the humble.</span><br />
	<span>Glory is the portion of the wise, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">all that fools inherit is contempt.</span><br />
</p>

<h4>On choosing wisdom (4:1–27)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Listen, my children, to a father’s instruction; </span><br />
	<span class="i1">pay attention, and learn what understanding is.</span><br />
	<span>What I am offering you is sound doctrine: </span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not forsake my teaching.</span><br />
	<span>I too was once a child with a father, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">in my mother’s eyes a tender child, unique.</span><br />
	<span>This was what he used to teach me, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">“Let your heart treasure what I have to say, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">keep my principles and you will live;</span><br />
	<span>acquire wisdom, acquire understanding, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">never forget her, never deviate from my words.</span><br />
	<span>Do not desert her, she will keep you safe; </span><br />
	<span class="i1">love her, she will watch over you.</span><br />
	<span>The first principle of wisdom is: acquire wisdom; </span><br />
	<span class="i1">at the cost of all you have, acquire understanding!</span><br />
	<span>Hold her close, and she will make you great; </span><br />
	<span class="i1">embrace her, and she will be your pride;</span><br />
	<span>she will provide a graceful garland for your head, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">bestow a crown of honour on you”.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Listen, my child, take my words to heart, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the years of your life will be multiplied.</span><br />
	<span>I have educated you in the ways of wisdom, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">I have guided you along the path of honesty.</span><br />
	<span>When you walk, your going will be unhindered, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">if you run, you will not stumble.</span><br />
	<span>Hold fast to discipline, never let her go, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">keep your eyes on her, she is your life.</span><br />
	<span>Do not follow the path of the wicked, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not walk the way that the evil go.</span><br />
	<span>Avoid it, do not take it, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">turn your back on it, pass it by.</span><br />
	<span>For they cannot sleep unless they have first done wrong, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">they miss their sleep if they have not made someöne stumble;</span><br />
	<span>for the bread of wickedness is what they eat, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the wine of violence is what they drink.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>The path of the upright is like the light of dawn, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">its brightness growing to the fullness of day;</span><br />
	<span>the way of the wicked is as dark as night, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">they cannot tell the obstacles they stumble over.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>My child, pay attention to what I am telling you, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">listen carefully to my words;</span><br />
	<span>do not let them out of your sight, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">keep them deep in your heart.</span><br />
	<span>For they are life to those who find them </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and health to all humanity.</span><br />
	<span>More than all else, keep watch over your heart, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">since here are the wellsprings of life.</span><br />
	<span>Turn your back on the mouth that misleads, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">keep your distance from lips that deceive.</span><br />
	<span>Let your eyes be fixed ahead, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">your gaze be straight before you.</span><br />
	<span>Let the path you tread be level </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and all your ways be firm.</span><br />
	<span>Turn neither to right nor to left, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">keep your foot clear of evil.</span><br />
</p>

<h4>Against adultery. Where the wise man’s love should be (5:1–23)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>My son, pay attention to my wisdom, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">listen carefully to what I know;</span><br />
	<span>so that you may preserve discretion </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and your lips may guard knowledge. </span><br />
	<span>Take no notice of a loose-living woman,</span><br />
	<span>for the lips of the adulteress drip with honey, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">her palate is more unctuous than oil,</span><br />
	<span>but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">sharp as a two-edged sword.</span><br />
	<span>Her feet go down to death, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">Sheol the goal of her steps;</span><br />
	<span>far from following the path of life, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">her course is uncertain and she does not know it.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>And now, son, listen to me, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">never deviate from what I say:</span><br />
	<span>set your course as far from her as possible, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">go nowhere near the door of her house,</span><br />
	<span>or she will hand over your honour to others, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">the years of your life to a man without pity,</span><br />
	<span>and strangers will batten on your property, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and your produce go to the house of a stranger,</span><br />
	<span>and, at your ending, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">your body and flesh having been consumed, </span><br />
	<span>you will groan and exclaim, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">“Alas, I hated discipline, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">my heart spurned all correction;</span><br />
	<span>I would not attend to the voice of my masters, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">I would not listen to those who tried to teach me.</span><br />
	<span>Now I have come to nearly every kind of misery, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">in the assembly and in the community”.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Drink the water from your own storage-well, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">fresh water from your own spring.</span><br />
	<span>Even if your fountains overflow outside, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">your streams of water in the public squares:</span><br />
	<span>let them be for you alone, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and not for strangers with you.</span><br />
	<span>May your fountain-head be blessed!</span><br />
</p> 

<p class="poem">
	<span>Find joy with the wife you married in your youth,</span><br />
	<span class="i1">fair as a hind, graceful as a fawn: </span><br />
	<span class="i1">hers the breasts that ever fill you with delight, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">hers the love that ever holds you captive.</span><br />
	<span>Why be seduced, my son, by someöne else’s wife, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and fondle the breast of a woman who belongs to another?</span><br />
	<span>For the eyes of Yahweh observe human ways, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and survey all human paths.</span><br />
	<span>The wicked is snared in his own misdeeds, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">is caught in the meshes of his own sin.</span><br />
	<span>For want of discipline, he dies, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">led astray by his own excessive folly.</span><br />
</p>

<h4>On surety rashly offered (6:1–5)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>My child, if you have gone surety for your neighbour, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">if you have guaranteed the bond of a stranger,</span><br />
	<span>if you have committed yourself with your lips, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">if through words of yours you have been entrapped,</span><br />
	<span>do this, my child, to extricate yourself — </span><br />
	<span class="i1">since you have put yourself in the power of your neighbour: </span><br />
	<span>go, humble yourself, plead with your neighbour,</span><br />
	<span>give your eyes no sleep, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">your eyelids no rest,</span><br />
	<span>break free like a gazelle from the trap, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">like a bird from the fowler’s clutches.</span><br />
</p>

<h4>The idler and the ant (6:6–11)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Idler, go to the ant; </span><br />
	<span class="i1">ponder her ways and grow wise:</span><br />
	<span>no one gives her orders, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">no overseer, no master,</span><br />
	<span>yet all through the summer she gets her food ready, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and gathers her supplies at harvest time.</span><br />
	<span>How long do you intend to lie there, idler? </span><br />
	<span class="i1">When are you going to rise from your sleep?</span><br />
	<span>A little sleep, a little drowsiness, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">a little folding of the arms to lie back,</span><br />
	<span>and poverty comes like a vagrant </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and, like a beggar, dearth.</span><br />
</p>

<h4>Portrait of a scoundrel (6:12–15)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>A scoundrel, a vicious man, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">he goes with a leer on his lips,</span><br />
	<span>winking his eye, shuffling his foot, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">beckoning with his finger.</span><br />
	<span>Trickery in his heart, always scheming evil, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">he sows dissension.</span><br />
	<span>Disaster will overtake him sharply for this, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">suddenly, irretrievably, he will be broken.</span><br />

<h4>Seven things abhorrent to God (6:16–19)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>There are six things that Yahweh hates, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">seven that he abhors:</span><br />
	<span>a haughty look, a lying tongue, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">hands that shed innocent blood,</span><br />
	<span>a heart that weaves wicked plots, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">feet that hurry to do evil,</span><br />
	<span>a false witness who lies with every breath, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and one who sows dissension among brothers.</span><br />
</p>

<h4>More fatherly advice (6:20–7:27)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Keep your father’s precept, my child, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not spurn your mother’s teaching.</span><br />
	<span>Bind them ever to your heart, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">tie them around your neck.</span><br />
	<span>While you are active, they will guide you, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">when you fall asleep, they will watch over you, </span><br />
	<span>when you wake up, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">they will converse with you.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>For the precept is a lamp, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">the teaching is a light; </span><br />
	<span class="i1">correction and discipline are the way to life,</span><br />
	<span>preserving you from the woman of bad character, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">from the wheedling talk of a woman who belongs to another.</span><br />
	<span>Do not covet her beauty in your heart </span><br />
	<span class="i1">or let her captivate you with the play of her eyes;</span><br />
	<span>a prostitute can be bought for a hunk of bread, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">but a married woman aims to snare a precious life.</span><br />
	<span>Can a man carry fire inside his shirt </span><br />
	<span class="i1">without setting his clothes alight?</span><br />
	<span>Can you walk on red-hot coals </span><br />
	<span class="i1">without burning your feet?</span><br />
	<span>Just so, the man who makes love to his neighbour’s wife: </span><br />
	<span class="i1">no one who touches her will get off unpunished.</span><br />
	<span>People attach but little blame to a thief </span><br />
	<span class="i1">who steals only to satisfy his hunger;</span><br />
	<span>yet even he, if caught, will have to repay sevenfold </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and hand over all his family resources.</span><br />
	<span>But the adulterer has no sense; </span><br />
	<span class="i1">he works his own destruction.</span><br />
	<span>All he will get is blows and contempt, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and dishonour never to be blotted out.</span><br />
	<span>For jealousy inflames the husband </span><br />
	<span class="i1">who will show no mercy when the day comes for revenge;</span><br />
	<span>he will not consider any compensation; </span><br />
	<span class="i1">lavish what gifts you may, he will not be placated.</span><br />
	<span>My child, keep my words, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and treasure my precepts,</span><br />
	<span>keep my precepts and you will live, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">keep my teaching as the apple of your eye.</span><br />
	<span>Bind these to your fingers, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">write them on the tablet of your heart.</span><br />
	<span>Say to Wisdom, “You are my sister!”. </span><br />
	<span class="i1">Call Understanding your relation,</span><br />
	<span>to save yourself from the woman that belongs to another, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">from the stranger, with her seductive words.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>While I was at the window of my house, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">I was looking out through the lattice</span><br />
	<span>and I saw, among the callow youths, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">I noticed among the lads, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">one boy who had no sense.</span><br />
	<span>Going along the lane, near the corner where she lives, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">he reaches the path to her house,</span><br />
	<span>at twilight when day is declining, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">at dead of night and in the dark.</span><br />
	<span>And look, a woman is coming to meet him, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">dressed like a prostitute, false of heart.</span><br />
	<span>She is loud and brazen; </span><br />
	<span class="i1">her feet cannot rest at home.</span><br />
	<span>Once in the street, once in the square, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">she lurks at every corner.</span><br />
	<span>She catches hold of him, she kisses him, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">the bold-faced creature says to him,</span><br />
	<span>“I had to offer a communion sacrifice, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">I have discharged my vows today;</span><br />
	<span>that is why I came out to meet you, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">to look for you, and now I have found you.</span><br />
	<span>I have spread coverlets over my divan, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">embroidered stuff, Egyptian material,</span><br />
	<span>I have sprinkled my bed with myrrh, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">with aloes and cinnamon.</span><br />
	<span>Come on, we’ll make love as much as we like, until morning. </span><br />
	<span class="i1">Let us enjoy the delights of love!</span><br />
	<span>For my husband is not at home, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">he has gone on a very long journey,</span><br />
	<span>taking his moneybags with him; </span><br />
	<span class="i1">he will not be back until the moon is full”.</span><br />
	<span>With her persistent coaxing she overcomes him, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">lures him on with her wheedling patter.</span><br />
	<span>Forthwith he follows her, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">like an ox on its way to the slaughterhouse, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">like a madman on his way to the stocks,</span><br />
	<span>until an arrow pierces him to the liver, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">like the bird that dashes into the net </span><br />
	<span class="i1">without realising that its life is at stake.</span><br />
	<span>And now, son, listen to me, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">pay attention to the words I have to say:</span><br />
	<span>do not let your heart stray into her ways, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">or wander into her paths;</span><br />
	<span>she has done so many to death, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the strongest have all been her victims.</span><br />
	<span>Her house is the way to Sheol, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">the descent to the courts of death.</span><br />

	<span>On the heights overlooking the road, </span><br />

	<span>by the gates, at the entrance to the city, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">on the access-roads, she cries out,</span><br />
	<span>“I am calling to you, all people, </span><br />

	<span>My mouth proclaims the truth, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">for evil is abhorrent to my lips.</span><br />
	<span>All the words from my mouth are upright, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">nothing false there, nothing crooked,</span><br />
	<span>everything plain, if you can understand, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">straight, if you have acquired knowledge.</span><br />
	<span>Accept my discipline rather than silver, </span><br />

	<span>For Wisdom is more precious than jewels, </span><br />

	<span>Before the mountains were settled, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">before the hills, I came to birth;</span><br />
	<span>before he had made the earth, the countryside, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and the first elements of the world.</span><br />
	<span>When he fixed the heavens firm, I was there, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">when he drew a circle on the surface of the deep,</span><br />
	<span>when he thickened the clouds above, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">when the sources of the deep began to swell,</span><br />
	<span>when he assigned the sea its boundaries </span><br />
	<span class="i1">— and the waters will not encroach on the shore — </span><br />
	<span class="i1">when he traced the foundations of the earth,</span><br />
	<span>I was beside the master craftsman, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">delighting him day after day, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">ever at play in his presence,</span><br />

<p class="poem">
	<span>There are three things at which the earth trembles, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">four, indeed, which it cannot endure:</span><br />

	<span class="i1">a brute gorged with food,</span><br />
	<span>a hateful woman wed at last, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">a servant girl inheriting from her mistress.</span><br />

<p class="poem">
	<span>There are four creatures little on the earth, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">though they are wisest of the wise:</span><br />
	<span>ants, a race with no strength, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">yet in the summer they make sure of their food;</span><br />
	<span>the coneys, a race without defences, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">yet they make their home in the rocks;</span><br />
	<span>locusts, which have no king, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">yet they all march in good order;</span><br />
	<span>lizards, which you can catch in your hand, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">yet they frequent the palaces of kings.</span><br />

<p class="poem">
	<span>There are three things of stately tread, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">four, indeed, of stately walk:</span><br />
	<span>the lion, bravest of beasts, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">he will draw back from nothing;</span><br />
	<span>a vigorous cock, a he-goat, </span><br />

	<span>If you have been foolish enough to fly into a passion </span><br />

	<span class="i1">by wringing the nose you produce blood, </span><br />
	<span>and by whipping up anger you produce strife.</span><br />

<p>The sayings of Lemuel king of Massa, taught him by his mother:</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>What, my son! What, son of my womb! </span><br />
	<span class="i1">What, son of my vows!</span><br />
	<span>Do not expend your energy on women </span><br />
	<span class="i1">nor your wealth on those who ruin kings.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Not for kings, O Lemuel, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">not for kings the drinking of wine, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">not for princes the love of liquor,</span><br />
	<span>for fear that in liquor they forget what they have decreed </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and pervert the course of justice against all the poor.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Procure strong drink for someöne about to die, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">wine for him whose heart is heavy:</span><br />
	<span>let him drink and forget his misfortune, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and remember his misery no more.</span><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Make your views heard, on behalf of the dumb, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">on behalf of all the unwanted;</span><br />
	<span>make your views heard, pronounce an upright verdict, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">defend the cause of the poor and the wretched.</span><br />
