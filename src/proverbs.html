<h3>Commendation of Wisdom</h3>

<h4>The sage speaks: avoid bad company (1:8–19)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Listen, my child, to your father’s instruction, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not reject your mother’s teaching:</span><br />
	<span>they will be a crown of grace for your head, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">a circlet for your neck.</span><br />
	<span>My child, if sinners try to seduce you, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">do not go with them.</span><br />
	<span>If they say, “Come with us: </span><br />
	<span class="i1">let us lie in ambush to shed blood; </span><br />
	<span class="i1">if we plan an ambush for the innocent without provocation,</span><br />
	<span>we can swallow them alive, like Sheol, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and whole, like those who sink into oblivion.</span><br />
	<span>We shall find treasures of every sort, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">we shall fill our houses with plunder;</span><br />
	<span>throw in your lot with us: </span><br />
	<span class="i1">one purse between us all”.</span><br />
	<span>My child, do not follow them in their way, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">keep your steps out of their path</span><br />
	<span>for their feet hasten to evil, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">they are quick to shed blood;</span><br />
	<span>for the net is spread in vain </span><br />
	<span class="i1">if any winged creature can see it.</span><br />
	<span>It is for their own blood such people lie in wait, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">their ambush is against their own selves!</span><br />
	<span>Such are the paths of all who seek dishonest gain: </span><br />
	<span class="i1">which robs of their lives all who take it for their own.</span><br />
</p>

<h4>Wisdom speaks: a warning to the heedless (1:20:33)</h4>

<p class="poem">
	<span>Wisdom calls aloud in the streets, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">she raises her voice in the public squares;</span><br />
	<span>she calls out at the street corners, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">she delivers her message at the city gates.</span><br />
	<span>“You simple people, how much longer will you cling </span><br />
	<span class="i1">to your simple ways? </span><br />
	<span>How much longer will mockers revel in their mocking </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and fools go on hating knowledge?</span><br />
	<span>Pay attention to my warning. </span><br />
	<span class="i1">To you I will pour out my heart </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and tell you what I have to say.</span><br />
	<span>Since I have called and you have refused me, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">since I have beckoned and no one has taken notice,</span><br />
	<span>since you have ignored all my advice </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and rejected all my warnings,</span><br />
	<span>I, for my part, shall laugh at your distress, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">I shall jeer when terror befalls you,</span><br />
	<span>when terror befalls you, like a storm, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">when your distress arrives, like a whirlwind, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">when ordeal and anguish bear down on you.</span><br />
	<span>Then they will call me, but I shall not answer, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">they will look eagerly for me and will not find me.</span><br />
	<span>They have hated knowledge, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">they have not chosen the fear of Yahweh,</span><br />
	<span>they have taken no notice of my advice, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">they have spurned all my warnings:</span><br />
	<span>so they will have to eat the fruits of their own ways of life, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">and choke themselves with their own scheming.</span><br />
	<span>For the errors of the simple lead to their death, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">the complacency of fools works their own ruin;</span><br />
	<span>but whoëver listens to me may live secure, </span><br />
	<span class="i1">will have quiet, fearing no mischance”.</span><br />
</p>


Pro 2:1 My child, if you take my words to heart, if you set store by my commandments,

Pro 2:2 tuning your ear to wisdom, tuning your heart to understanding,

Pro 2:3 yes, if your plea is for clear perception, if you cry out for understanding,

Pro 2:4 if you look for it as though for silver, search for it as though for buried treasure,

Pro 2:5 then you will understand what the fear of Yahweh is, and discover the knowledge of God.

Pro 2:6 For Yahweh himself is giver of wisdom, from his mouth issue knowledge and understanding.

Pro 2:7 He reserves his advice for the honest, a shield to those whose ways are sound;



Pro 2:8 he stands guard over the paths of equity, he keeps watch over the way of those faithful to him.

Pro 2:9 Then you will understand uprightness, equity and fair dealing, the paths that lead to happiness.

Pro 2:10 When wisdom comes into your heart and knowledge fills your soul with delight,

Pro 2:1 1 then prudence will be there to watch over you, and understanding will be your guardian
Pro 2:12 to keep you from the way that is evil, from those whose speech is deceitful,

Pro 2:13 from those who leave the paths of honesty to walk the roads of darkness:

Pro 2:14 those who find their joy in doing wrong, and their delight in deceitfulness,

Pro 2:15 whose tracks are twisted, and the paths that they tread crooked.

Pro 2:16 To keep you, too, from the woman who belongs to another, from the stranger, with her wheedling
words;

Pro 2:17 she has left the partner of her younger days, she has forgotten the covenant of her God;

Pro 2:18 her house is tilting towards Death, down to the Shades go her paths.

Pro 2:19 Of those who go to her not one returns, they never regain the paths of life.

Pro 2:20 Thus you will tread the way of good people, persisting in the paths of the upright.

Pro 2:21 For the land will be for the honest to live in, the innocent will have it for their home;

Pro 2:22 while the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the faithless rooted out of it.

Pro 3:1 My child, do not forget my teaching, let your heart keep my principles,

Pro 3:2 since they will increase your length of days, your years of life and your well-being.

Pro 3:3 Let faithful love and constancy never leave you: tie them round your neck, write them on the tablet of
your heart.

Pro 3:4 Thus you will find favour and success in the sight of God and of people.

Pro 3:5 Trust wholeheartedly in Yahweh, put no faith in your own perception;

Pro 3:6 acknowledge him in every course you take, and he will see that your paths are smooth.

Pro 3:7 Do not congratulate yourself on your own wisdom, fear Yahweh and turn your back on evil:

Pro 3:8 health-giving, this, to your body, relief to your bones.

Pro 3:9 Honour Yahweh with what goods you have and with the first-fruits of all your produce;

Pro 3:10 then your barns will be filled with corn, your vats overflowing with new wine.

Pro 3:1 1 My child, do not scorn correction from Yahweh, do not resent his reproof;

Pro 3:12 for Yahweh reproves those he loves, as a father the child whom he loves.

Pro 3:13 Blessed are those who have discovered wisdom, those who have acquired understanding!

Pro 3:14 Gaining her is more rewarding than silver, her yield is more valuable than gold.

Pro 3:15 She is beyond the price of pearls, nothing you could covet is her equal.

Pro 3:16 In her right hand is length of days; in her left hand, riches and honour.

Pro 3:17 Her ways are filled with delight, her paths all lead to contentment.

Pro 3:18 She is a tree of life for those who hold her fast, those who cling to her live happy lives.

Pro 3:19 In wisdom, Yahweh laid the earth’s foundations, in understanding he spread out the heavens.

Pro 3:20 Through his knowledge the depths were cleft open, and the clouds distil the dew.

Pro 3:21 My child, hold to sound advice and prudence, never let them out of sight;

Pro 3:22 they will give life to your soul and beauty to your neck.

Pro 3:23 You will go on your way in safety, your feet will not stumble.

Pro 3:24 When you go to bed, you will not be afraid; once in bed, your sleep will be sweet.

Pro 3:25 Have no fear either of sudden terror or of attack mounted by wicked men,

Pro 3:26 since Yahweh will be your guarantor, he will keep your steps from the snare.

Pro 3:27 Refuse no kindness to those who have a right to it, if it is in your power to perform it.

Pro 3:28 Do not say to your neighbour, “Go away! Come another time! I will give it you tomorrow,’ if you can do it

now.

Pro 3:29 Do not plot harm against your neighbour who is living unsuspecting beside you.

Pro 3:30 Do not pick a groundless quarrel with anyone who has done you no harm.

Pro 3:31 Do not envy the man of violence, never model your conduct on his;

Pro 3:32 for the wilful wrong-doer is abhorrent to Yahweh, who confides only in the honest.

Pro 3:33 Yahweh’s curse lies on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the home of the upright.

Pro 3:34 He mocks those who mock, but accords his favour to the humble.

Pro 3:35 Glory is the portion of the wise, all that fools inherit is contempt.

Pro 4:1 Listen, my children, to a father’s instruction; pay attention, and learn what understanding is.

Pro 4:2 What I am offering you is sound doctrine: do not forsake my teaching.

Pro 4:3 I too was once a child with a father, in my mother’s eyes a tender child, unique.

Pro 4:4 This was what he used to teach me, “Let your heart treasure what I have to say, keep my principles and
you will live;

Pro 4:5 acquire wisdom, acquire understanding, never forget her, never deviate from my words.



Pro 4:6 Do not desert her, she will keep you safe; love her, she will watch over you.

Pro 4:7 The first principle of wisdom is: acquire wisdom; at the cost of all you have, acquire understanding!

Pro 4:8 Hold her close, and she will make you great; embrace her, and she will be your pride;

Pro 4:9 she will provide a graceful garland for your head, bestow a crown of honour on you”.

Pro 4:10 Listen, my child, take my words to heart, and the years of your life will be multiplied.

Pro 4:11 I have educated you in the ways of wisdom, I have guided you along the path of honesty.

Pro 4:12 When you walk, your going will be unhindered, if you run, you will not stumble.

Pro 4:13 Hold fast to discipline, never let her go, keep your eyes on her, she is your life.

Pro 4:14 Do not follow the path of the wicked, do not walk the way that the evil go.

Pro 4:15 Avoid it, do not take it, turn your back on it, pass it by.

Pro 4:16 For they cannot sleep unless they have first done wrong, they miss their sleep if they have not made
someöne stumble;

Pro 4:17 for the bread of wickedness is what they eat, and the wine of violence is what they drink.

Pro 4:18 The path of the upright is like the light of dawn, its brightness growing to the fullness of day;

Pro 4:19 the way of the wicked is as dark as night, they cannot tell the obstacles they stumble over.

Pro 4:20 My child, pay attention to what I am telling you, listen carefully to my words;

Pro 4:21 do not let them out of your sight, keep them deep in your heart.

Pro 4:22 For they are life to those who find them and health to all humanity.

Pro 4:23 More than all else, keep watch over your heart, since here are the wellsprings of life.

Pro 4:24 Turn your back on the mouth that misleads, keep your distance from lips that deceive.

Pro 4:25 Let your eyes be fixed ahead, your gaze be straight before you.

Pro 4:26 Let the path you tread be level and all your ways be firm.

Pro 4:27 Turn neither to right nor to left, keep your foot clear of evil.

Pro 5:1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom, listen carefully to what I know;

Pro 5:2 so that you may preserve discretion and your lips may guard knowledge. Take no notice of a loose-
living woman,

Pro 5:3 for the lips of the adulteress drip with honey, her palate is more unctuous than oil,

Pro 5:4 but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.

Pro 5:5 Her feet go down to death, Sheol the goal of her steps;

Pro 5:6 far from following the path of life, her course is uncertain and she does not know it.

Pro 5:7 And now, son, listen to me, never deviate from what I say:

Pro 5:8 set your course as far from her as possible, go nowhere near the door of her house,

Pro 5:9 or she will hand over your honour to others, the years of your life to a man without pity,

Pro 5:10 and strangers will batten on your property, and your produce go to the house of a stranger,

Pro 5:1 1 and, at your ending, your body and flesh having been consumed, you will groan
Pro 5:12 and exclaim, “Alas, I hated discipline, my heart spurned all correction;

Pro 5:13 I would not attend to the voice of my masters, I would not listen to those who tried to teach me.

Pro 5:14 Now I have come to nearly every kind of misery, in the assembly and in the community”.

Pro 5:15 Drink the water from your own storage-well, fresh water from your own spring.

Pro 5:16 Even if your fountains overflow outside, your streams of water in the public squares:

Pro 5:17 let them be for you alone, and not for strangers with you.

Pro 5:18 May your fountain-head be blessed! Find joy with the wife you married in your youth,

Pro 5:19 fair as a hind, graceful as a fawn: hers the breasts that ever fill you with delight, hers the love that ever
holds you captive.

Pro 5:20 Why be seduced, my son, by someöne else’s wife, and fondle the breast of a woman who belongs to
another?

Pro 5:21 For the eyes of Yahweh observe human ways, and survey all human paths.

Pro 5:22 The wicked is snared in his own misdeeds, is caught in the meshes of his own sin.

Pro 5:23 For want of discipline, he dies, led astray by his own excessive folly.

Pro 6:1 My child, if you have gone surety for your neighbour, if you have guaranteed the bond of a stranger,

Pro 6:2 if you have committed yourself with your lips, if through words of yours you have been entrapped,

Pro 6:3 do this, my child, to extricate yourself — since you have put yourself in the power of your neighbour: go,
humble yourself, plead with your neighbour,

Pro 6:4 give your eyes no sleep, your eyelids no rest,

Pro 6:5 break free like a gazelle from the trap, like a bird from the fowler’s clutches.

Pro 6:6 Idler, go to the ant; ponder her ways and grow wise:

Pro 6:7 no one gives her orders, no overseer, no master,

Pro 6:8 yet all through the summer she gets her food ready, and gathers her supplies at harvest time.

Pro 6:9 How long do you intend to lie there, idler? When are you going to rise from your sleep?



Pro 6:10 A little sleep, a little drowsiness, a little folding of the arms to lie back,

Pro 6:1 1 and poverty comes like a vagrant and, like a beggar, dearth.

Pro 6:12 A scoundrel, a vicious man, he goes with a leer on his lips,

Pro 6:13 winking his eye, shuffling his foot, beckoning with his finger.

Pro 6:14 Trickery in his heart, always scheming evil, he sows dissension.

Pro 6:15 Disaster will overtake him sharply for this, suddenly, irretrievably, he will be broken.

Pro 6:16 There are six things that Yahweh hates, seven that he abhors:

Pro 6:17 a haughty look, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,

Pro 6:18 a heart that weaves wicked plots, feet that hurry to do evil,

Pro 6:19 a false witness who lies with every breath, and one who sows dissension among brothers.

Pro 6:20 Keep your father’s precept, my child, do not spurn your mother’s teaching.

Pro 6:21 Bind them ever to your heart, tie them round your neck.

Pro 6:22 While you are active, they will guide you, when you fall asleep, they will watch over you, when you
wake up, they will converse with you.

Pro 6:23 For the precept is a lamp, the teaching is a light; correction and discipline are the way to life,

Pro 6:24 preserving you from the woman of bad character, from the wheedling talk of a woman who belongs to
another.

Pro 6:25 Do not covet her beauty in your heart or let her captivate you with the play of her eyes;

Pro 6:26 a prostitute can be bought for a hunk of bread, but a married woman aims to snare a precious life.

Pro 6:27 Can a man carry fire inside his shirt without setting his clothes alight?

Pro 6:28 Can you walk on red-hot coals without burning your feet?

Pro 6:29 Just so, the man who makes love to his neighbour’s wife: no one who touches her will get off
unpunished.

Pro 6:30 People attach but little blame to a thief who steals only to satisfy his hunger;

Pro 6:31 yet even he, if caught, will have to repay sevenfold and hand over all his family resources.

Pro 6:32 But the adulterer has no sense; he works his own destruction.

Pro 6:33 All he will get is blows and contempt, and dishonour never to be blotted out.

Pro 6:34 For jealousy inflames the husband who will show no mercy when the day comes for revenge;

Pro 6:35 he will not consider any compensation; lavish what gifts you may, he will not be placated.

Pro 7:1 My child, keep my words, and treasure my precepts,

Pro 7:2 keep my precepts and you will live, keep my teaching as the apple of your eye.

Pro 7:3 Bind these to your fingers, write them on the tablet of your heart.

Pro 7:4 Say to Wisdom, “You are my sister!”. Call Understanding your relation,

Pro 7:5 to save yourself from the woman that belongs to another, from the stranger, with her seductive words.

Pro 7:6 While I was at the window of my house, I was looking out through the lattice

Pro 7:7 and I saw, among the callow youths, I noticed among the lads, one boy who had no sense.

Pro 7:8 Going along the lane, near the corner where she lives, he reaches the path to her house,

Pro 7:9 at twilight when day is declining, at dead of night and in the dark.

Pro 7:10 And look, a woman is coming to meet him, dressed like a prostitute, false of heart.

Pro 7:1 1 She is loud and brazen; her feet cannot rest at home.

Pro 7:12 Once in the street, once in the square, she lurks at every corner.

Pro 7:13 She catches hold of him, she kisses him, the bold-faced creature says to him,

Pro 7:14 “I had to offer a communion sacrifice, I have discharged my vows today;

Pro 7:15 that is why I came out to meet you, to look for you, and now I have found you.

Pro 7:16 I have spread coverlets over my divan, embroidered stuff, Egyptian material,

Pro 7:17 I have sprinkled my bed with myrrh, with aloes and cinnamon.

Pro 7:18 Come on, we'll make love as much as we like, till morning. Let us enjoy the delights of love!

Pro 7:19 For my husband is not at home, he has gone on a very long journey,

Pro 7:20 taking his moneybags with him; he will not be back till the moon is full”.

Pro 7:21 With her persistent coaxing she overcomes him, lures him on with her wheedling patter.

Pro 7:22 Forthwith he follows her, like an ox on its way to the slaughterhouse, like a madman on his way to the
stocks,

Pro 7:23 until an arrow pierces him to the liver, like the bird that dashes into the net without realising that its life
is at stake.

Pro 7:24 And now, son, listen to me, pay attention to the words I have to say:

Pro 7:25 do not let your heart stray into her ways, or wander into her paths;

Pro 7:26 she has done so many to death, and the strongest have all been her victims.

Pro 7:27 Her house is the way to Sheol, the descent to the courts of death.

Pro 8:1 Is not Wisdom calling? Is not Understanding raising her voice?



Pro 8:2 On the heights overlooking the road, at the crossways, she takes her stand;

Pro 8:3 by the gates, at the entrance to the city, on the access-roads, she cries out,

Pro 8:4 “I am calling to you, all people, my words are addressed to all humanity.

Pro 8:5 Simpletons, learn how to behave, fools, come to your senses.

Pro 8:6 Listen, I have something important to tell you, when I speak, my words are right.

Pro 8:7 My mouth proclaims the truth, for evil is abhorrent to my lips.

Pro 8:8 All the words from my mouth are upright, nothing false there, nothing crooked,

Pro 8:9 everything plain, if you can understand, straight, if you have acquired knowledge.

Pro 8:10 Accept my discipline rather than silver, and knowledge of me in preference to finest gold.

Pro 8:11 For Wisdom is more precious than jewels, and nothing else is so worthy of desire.

Pro 8:12 “I, Wisdom, share house with Discretion, I am mistress of the art of thought.

Pro 8:13 (Fear of Yahweh means hatred of evil.) I hate pride and arrogance, wicked behaviour and a lying
mouth.

Pro 8:14 To me belong good advice and prudence, I am perception: power is mine!

Pro 8:15 By me monarchs rule and princes decree what is right;

Pro 8:16 by me rulers govern, so do nobles, the lawful authorities.

Pro 8:17 I love those who love me; whoëver searches eagerly for me finds me.

Pro 8:18 With me are riches and honour, lasting wealth and saving justice.

Pro 8:19 The fruit I give is better than gold, even the finest, the return I make is better than pure silver.

Pro 8:20 I walk in the way of uprightness in the path of justice,

Pro 8:21 to endow my friends with my wealth and to fill their treasuries.

Pro 8:22 “Yahweh created me, first-fruits of his fashioning, before the oldest of his works.

Pro 8:23 From everlasting, I was firmly set, from the beginning, before the earth came into being.

Pro 8:24 The deep was not, when I was born, nor were the springs with their abounding waters.

Pro 8:25 Before the mountains were settled, before the hills, I came to birth;

Pro 8:26 before he had made the earth, the countryside, and the first elements of the world.

Pro 8:27 When he fixed the heavens firm, I was there, when he drew a circle on the surface of the deep,

Pro 8:28 when he thickened the clouds above, when the sources of the deep began to swell,

Pro 8:29 when he assigned the sea its boundaries — and the waters will not encroach on the shore — when he
traced the foundations of the earth,

Pro 8:30 I was beside the master craftsman, delighting him day after day, ever at play in his presence,

Pro 8:31 at play everywhere on his earth, delighting to be with the children of men.

Pro 8:32 “And now, my children, listen to me. Happy are those who keep my ways.

Pro 8:33 Listen to instruction and become wise, do not reject it.

Pro 8:34 Blessed, whoëver listens to me, who day after day keeps watch at my gates to guard my portals.

Pro 8:35 For whoëver finds me finds life, and obtains the favour of Yahweh;

Pro 8:36 but whoëver misses me harms himself, all who hate me are in love with death”.

Pro 9:1 Wisdom has built herself a house, she has hewn her seven pillars,

Pro 9:2 she has slaughtered her beasts, drawn her wine, she has laid her table.

Pro 9:3 She has despatched her maidservants and proclaimed from the heights above the city,

Pro 9:4 “Who is simple? Let him come this way”. To the fool she says,

Pro 9:5 “Come and eat my bread, drink the wine which I have drawn!

Pro 9:6 Leave foolishness behind and you will live, go forwards in the ways of perception”.

Pro 9:7 Reprove a mocker and you attract contempt, rebuke the wicked and you attract dishonour.

Pro 9:8 Do not rebuke the mocker, he will hate you. Rebuke the wise and he will love you for it.

Pro 9:9 Be open with the wise, he grows wiser still, teach the upright, he will gain yet more.

Pro 9:10 The first principle of wisdom is the fear of Yahweh, What God’s holy ones know — this is
understanding.

Pro 9:1 1 For by me your days will be multiplied, and your years of life increased.

Pro 9:12 Are you wise? You are wise to your own good. A mocker? The burden is yours alone.

Pro 9:13 A silly woman acts on impulse, is foolish and knows nothing.

Pro 9:14 She sits at the door of her house, on a throne high up in the city,

Pro 9:15 calling to the passers-by, who are walking straight past on their way,

Pro 9:16 “Who is simple? Turn aside, come over here”. To the fool she says,

Pro 9:17 “Stolen waters are sweet, and bread tastes better when eaten in secret”.

Pro 9:18 But the fool does not know that this is where the Shades are and that her guests are already in the
vales of Sheol.

Pro 19:12 Like the roaring of a lion, the anger of a king, but like dew on the grass his favour.

Pro 19:13 A foolish child is a disaster for the father, the bickerings of a wife are like an ever-dripping gutter.

Pro 19:14 From fathers comes inheritance of house and wealth, from Yahweh a wife who is discreet.

Pro 19:15 Idleness lulls to sleep, the feckless soul will go hungry.



Pro 19:16 Keeping the commandment is self-preservation, but whoëver despises these ways will die.

Pro 19:17 Whoëver is kind to the poor is lending to Yahweh who will repay him the kindness done.

Pro 19:18 While there is hope for him, chastise your child, but do not get so angry as to kill him.

Pro 19:19 The violent lays himself open to a penalty; spare him, and you aggravate his crime.

Pro 19:20 Listen to advice, accept correction, to be the wiser in the time to come.

Pro 19:21 Many are the plans in the human heart, but the purpose of Yahweh — that stands firm.

Pro 19:22 Faithful love is what people look for in a person; they prefer the poor to a liar.

Pro 1 9:23 The fear of Yahweh leads to life, it brings food and shelter, without fear of evil.

Pro 19:24 Into the dish the idler dips his hand, but bring it back to his mouth he cannot.

Pro 19:25 Strike a cynic, and simpletons will be more wary; reprove the intelligent and he will understand your
meaning.

Pro 19:26 He who ill-treats his father and drives out his mother is a child both worthless and depraved.

Pro 19:27 Give up listening to instruction, my child, if you mean to stray from words of knowledge.

Pro 19:28 A perjured witness holds the law in scorn; the mouth of the wicked feasts on evil-doing.

Pro 1 9:29 Punishments were made for mockers, and beating for the backs of fools.

Pro 20:1 Wine is reckless, liquor rowdy; unwise is anyone whom it seduces.

Pro 20:2 Like the roaring of a lion is the fury of a king; whoëver provokes him sins against himself.

Pro 20:3 It is praiseworthy to stop short of a law-suit; only a fool flies into a rage.

Pro 20:4 In autumn the idler does not plough, at harvest time he looks — nothing there!

Pro 20:5 The resources of the human heart are like deep waters: an understanding person has only to draw on
them.

Pro 20:6 Many describe themselves as people of faithful love, but who can find someöne really to be trusted?
Pro 20:7 The upright whose ways are blameless — blessed the children who come after!

Pro 20:8 A king enthroned on the judgement seat with one look scatters all that is evil.

Pro 20:9 Who can say, “I have cleansed my heart, I am purified of my sin 1 ?

Pro 20:10 One weight here, another there; here one measure, there another: both alike are abhorrent to
Yahweh.

Pro 20:1 1 A young man’s character appears in what he does, if his behaviour is pure and straight.

Pro 20:12 Ear that hears, eye that sees, Yahweh has made both of these.

Pro 20:13 Do not love sleep or you will know poverty; keep your eyes open and have your fill of food.

Pro 20:14 “No good, no good!”. says the buyer, but he goes off congratulating himself.

Pro 20:15 There are gold and jewels of every type, but a priceless ornament is speech informed by knowledge.
Pro 20:16 Take the man’s clothes! He has gone surety for a stranger. Take a pledge from him to the profit of
persons unknown!

Pro 20:17 Bread is sweet when it is got by fraud, but later the mouth is full of grit.

Pro 20:18 Plans are matured by consultation; take wise advice when waging war.

Pro 20:19 The bearer of gossip lets out secrets; do not mingle with chatterers.

Pro 20:20 Whoëver curses father or mother will have his lamp put out in the deepest darkness.

Pro 20:21 Property quickly come by at first will not be blessed in the end.

Pro 20:22 Do not say, “I shall repay evil”; put your hope in Yahweh and he will keep you safe.

Pro 20:23 One weight here, another there: this is abhorrent to Yahweh, false scales are not good.

Pro 20:24 Yahweh guides the steps of the powerful: but who can comprehend human ways?

Pro 20:25 Anyone is trapped who cries “Dedicated!”. and begins to reflect only after the vow.

Pro 20:26 A wise king winnows the wicked and makes the wheel pass over them.

Pro 20:27 The human spirit is the lamp of Yahweh — searching the deepest self.

Pro 20:28 Faithful love and loyalty mount guard over the king, his throne is founded on saving justice.

Pro 20:29 The pride of the young is their strength, the ornament of the old, grey hairs.

Pro 20:30 Wounding strokes are good medicine for evil, blows have an effect on the inmost self.

Pro 21:1 Like flowing water is a king’s heart in Yahweh’s hand; he directs it wherever he pleases.

Pro 21 :2 All actions are straight in the doer’s own eyes, but it is Yahweh who weighs hearts.

Pro 21 :3 To do what is upright and just is more pleasing to Yahweh than sacrifice.

Pro 21 :4 Haughty eye, proud heart, lamp of the wicked, nothing but sin.

Pro 21 :5 The hardworking is thoughtful, and all is gain; too much haste, and all that comes of it is want.

Pro 21 :6 To make a fortune with the help of a lying tongue: such is the idle fantasy of those who look for death.
Pro 21 :7 The violence of the wicked proves their ruin, for they refuse to do what is right.

Pro 21 :8 The way of the felon is devious, the conduct of the innocent straight.

Pro 21 :9 Better the corner of a roof to live on than a house shared with a quarrelsome woman.

Pro 21:10 The soul of the wicked is intent on evil, to such a person no neighbour can ever do right.

Pro 21:11 When a cynic is punished, simpletons grow wiser, but someöne of understanding acquires knowledge



by instruction.

Pro 21:12 The Upright One watches the house of the wicked; he hurls the wicked to destruction.

Pro 21:13 Whoëver refuses to listen to the cry of the weak, will in turn plead and not be heard.

Pro 21:14 Anger is mollified by a covert gift, raging fury by a present under cover of the cloak.

Pro 21:15 Doing what is right fills the upright with joy, but evil-doers with terror.

Pro 21:16 Whoëver strays far from the way of prudence will rest in the assembly of shadows.

Pro 21:17 Pleasure-lovers stay poor, no one will grow rich who loves wine and good living.

Pro 21:18 The wicked is a ransom for the upright; and the law-breaker for the honest.

Pro 21:19 Better to live in a desert land than with a quarrelsome and irritable woman.

Pro 21 :20 The wise has valuables and oil at home, but a fool soon runs through both.

Pro 21 :21 Whoëver pursues uprightness and faithful love will find life, uprightness and honour.

Pro 21 :22 A sage can scale a garrisoned city and shatter the rampart on which it relied.

Pro 21 :23 Watch kept over mouth and tongue keeps the watcher safe from disaster.

Pro 21 :24 Insolent, haughty — the name is “Cynic”; overweening pride marks such behaviour.

Pro 21 :25 The idler’s desires are the death of him, since his hands will do no work.

Pro 21 :26 All day long the godless is racked by desire, the upright gives without ever refusing.

Pro 21 .21 The sacrifice of the wicked is abhorrent, above all if it is offered for bad motives.

Pro 21 :28 The false witness will perish, but no one who knows how to listen will ever be silenced.

Pro 21 :29 The wicked man’s strength shows on his face, but the honest it is whose steps are firm.

Pro 21 :30 No wisdom, no understanding, no advice is worth anything before Yahweh.

Pro 21 :31 Fit out the cavalry for the day of battle, but the victory is Yahweh’s.

Pro 22:1 Fame is preferable to great wealth, favour, to silver and gold.

Pro 22:2 Rich and poor rub shoulders, Yahweh has made them both.

Pro 22:3 The discreet sees danger and takes shelter, simpletons go ahead and pay the penalty.

Pro 22:4 The reward of humility is the fear of Yahweh, and riches, honour and life.

Pro 22:5 Thorns and snares line the path of the wilful, whoëver values life will stay at a distance.

Pro 22:6 Give a lad a training suitable to his character and, even when old, he will not go back on it.

Pro 22:7 The rich lords it over the poor, the borrower is the lender’s slave.

Pro 22:8 Whoëver sows injustice reaps disaster, and the rod of such anger will disappear.

Pro 22:9 A kindly eye will earn a blessing, such a person shares out food with the poor.

Pro 22:10 Expel the mocker and strife goes too, law-suits and dislike die down.

Pro 22:1 1 Whoëver loves the pure of heart and is gracious of speech has the king for a friend.

Pro 22:12 Yahweh’s eyes protect knowledge, but he confounds deceitful speeches.

Pro 22:13 “There is a lion outside”, says the idler, “I shall be killed in the street!”.

Pro 22:14 The mouth of an adulterous woman is a deep pit, into it falls the man whom Yahweh rebukes.

Pro 22:15 Folly is anchored in the heart of a youth, the whip of instruction will rid him of it.

Pro 22:16 Harsh treatment enriches the poor, but a gift impoverishes the rich.

Pro 22:17 Give ear, listen to the sayings of the sages, and apply your heart to what I know,

Pro 22:18 for it will be a delight to keep them deep within you to have them all ready on your lips.

Pro 22:19 So that your trust may be in Yahweh, it is you whom I wish to instruct today.

Pro 22:20 Have I not written for you thirty chapters of advice and knowledge,

Pro 22:21 to make you know the certainty of true sayings, so that you can return with sound answers to those
who sent you?

Pro 22:22 Do not despoil the weak, for he is weak, and do not oppress the poor at the gate,

Pro 22:23 for Yahweh takes up their cause, and extorts the life of their extortioners.

Pro 22:24 Do not make friends with one who gives way to anger, make no one quick-tempered a companion of
yours,

Pro 22:25 for fear you learn such behaviour and in it find a snare for yourself.

Pro 22:26 Do not be one of those who go guarantor, who go surety for debts:

Pro 22:27 if you have no means of paying your bed will be taken from under you.

Pro 22:28 Do not displace the ancient boundary-stone set by your ancestors.

Pro 22:29 You see someöne alert at his business? His aim will be to serve kings; not for him the service of the
obscure.

Pro 23:1 If you take your seat at a great man’s table, take careful note of what you have before you;

Pro 23:2 if you have a big appetite put a knife to your throat.

Pro 23:3 Do not hanker for his delicacies, for they are deceptive food.

Pro 23:4 Do not wear yourself out in quest of wealth, stop applying your mind to this.

Pro 23:5 Fix your gaze on it, and it is there no longer, for it is able to sprout wings like an eagle that flies off to
the sky.



Pro 23:6 Do not eat the food of anyone whose eye is jealous, do not hanker for his delicacies.

Pro 23:7 For what he is really thinking about is himself: “Eat and drink”, he tells you, but his heart is not with you.
Pro 23:8 You will spit out whatever you have eaten and find your compliments wasted.

Pro 23:9 Do not waste words on a fool, who will not appreciate the shrewdness of your remarks.

Pro 23:10 Do not displace the ancient boundary-stone, or encroach on orphans’ lands,

Pro 23:1 1 for they have a powerful avenger, and he will take up their cause against you.

Pro 23:12 Apply your heart to discipline, and your ears to instructive sayings.

Pro 23:13 Do not be chary of correcting a child, a stroke of the cane is not likely to be fatal.

Pro 23:14 Give him a stroke of the cane, you will save his soul from Sheol.

Pro 23:15 My child, if your heart is wise, then my own heart is glad,

Pro 23:16 and my inmost self rejoices when from your lips come honest words.

Pro 23:17 Do not let your heart be envious of sinners but remain steady every day in the fear of Yahweh;

Pro 23:18 for there is a future, and your hope will not come to nothing.

Pro 23:19 Listen, my child, and be wise, and guide your heart in the way.

Pro 23:20 Do not be one of those forever tippling wine nor one of those who gorge themselves with meat;

Pro 23:21 for the drunkard and glutton impoverish themselves, and sleepiness is clothed in rags.

Pro 23:22 Listen to your father from whom you are sprung, do not despise your mother in her old age.

Pro 23:23 Purchase truth — never sell it-wisdom, discipline, and discernment.

Pro 23:24 The father of the upright will rejoice indeed, he who fathers a wise child will have joy of it.

Pro 23:25 Your father and mother will be happy, and she who bore you joyful.

Pro 23:26 My child, pay attention to me, let your eyes take pleasure in my way:

Pro 23:27 a prostitute is a deep pit, a narrow well, the woman who belongs to another.

Pro 23:28 Yes, like a brigand, she lies in wait, increasing the number of law-breakers.

Pro 23:29 For whom is pity, for whom contempt, for whom is strife, for whom complaint, for whom blows struck
at random, for whom the clouded eye?

Pro 23:30 For those who linger over wine too long, ever on the look-out for the blended liquors.

Pro 23:31 Do not gaze at wine, how red it is, how it sparkles in the cup! How smoothly it slips down the throat!
Pro 23:32 In the end its bite is like a serpent’s, its sting as sharp as an adder’s.

Pro 23:33 Your eyes will see peculiar things, you will talk nonsense from your heart.

Pro 23:34 You will be like someöne sleeping in mid-ocean, like one asleep at the mast-head.

Pro 23:35 “Struck me, have they? But I'm not hurt. Beaten me? I don’t feel anything. When shall I wake up? . . I'll
ask for more of it!”.

Pro 24:1 Do not be envious of the wicked or wish for their company,

Pro 24:2 for their hearts are scheming violence, their lips talking mischief.

Pro 24:3 By wisdom a house is built, by understanding it is made strong;

Pro 24:4 by knowledge its storerooms are filled with riches of every kind, rare and desirable.

Pro 24:5 The wise is mighty in power, strength is reinforced by science;

Pro 24:6 for it is by strategy that you wage war, and victory depends on having many counsellors.

Pro 24:7 For a fool wisdom is an inaccessible fortress: at the city gate he does not open his mouth.

Pro 24:8 Anyone intent on evil-doing is known as a master in cunning.

Pro 24:9 Folly dreams of nothing but sin, the mocker is abhorrent.

Pro 24:10 If you lose heart when things go wrong, your strength is not worth much.

Pro 24:1 1 Save those being dragged towards death, but can you rescue those on their way to execution?

Pro 24:12 If you say, “But look, we did not know”, will the Weigher of the heart pay no attention? Will not the
Guardian of your soul be aware and repay you as your deeds deserve?

Pro 24:13 Eat honey, my child, since it is good; honey that drips from the comb is sweet to the taste:

Pro 24:14 and so, for sure, will wisdom be to your soul: find it and you will have a future and your hope will not
be cut short.

Pro 24:15 Do not lurk, wicked man, round the upright man’s dwelling, do not despoil his house.

Pro 24:16 For though the upright falls seven times, he gets up again; the wicked are the ones who stumble in
adversity.

Pro 24:17 Should your enemy fall, do not rejoice, when he stumbles do not let your heart exult:

Pro 24:18 for fear that Yahweh will be displeased at the sight and turn his anger away from him.

Pro 24:19 Do not be indignant about the wicked, do not be envious of the evil,

Pro 24:20 for there is no future for the evil, the lamp of the wicked will go out.

Pro 24:21 Fear Yahweh, my child, and fear the king; do not ally yourself with innovators;

Pro 24:22 for suddenly disaster will loom for them, and who knows what ruin will seize them and their friends?
Pro 24:23 The following are also taken from the sages: To show partiality in judgement is not good.

Pro 24:24 Whoëver tells the wicked, “You are upright”, peoples curse him, nations revile him;



Pro 24:25 but those who correct him, come out of it well, on them will come a happy blessing.

Pro 24:26 Whoëver returns an honest answer, plants a kiss on the lips.

Pro 24:27 Plan what you want on the open ground, make your preparation in the field; then go and build your
house.

Pro 24:28 Do not bear witness lightly against your neighbour, nor deceive with your lips.

Pro 24:29 Do not say, “I will treat my neighbour as my neighbour treated me; I will repay everyone what each
has earned”.

Pro 24:30 By the idler’s field I was passing, by the vineyard of a man who had no sense,

Pro 24:31 there it all lay, deep in thorns, entirely overgrown with weeds, and its stone wall broken down.

Pro 24:32 And as I gazed I pondered, I drew this lesson from the sight,

Pro 24:33 “A little sleep, a little drowsiness, a little folding of the arms to lie back
Pro 24:34 and poverty comes like a vagrant, and, like a beggar, dearth”.

Pro 25:1 Here are some more of Solomon’s proverbs, transcribed at the court of Hezekiah king of Judah:

Pro 25:2 To conceal a matter, this is the glory of God, to sift it thoroughly, the glory of kings.

Pro 25:3 The heavens for height and the earth for depth, unfathomable, as are the hearts of kings.

Pro 25:4 From silver remove the dross and it emerges wholly purified;

Pro 25:5 from the king’s presence remove the wicked and on uprightness his throne is founded.

Pro 25:6 In the presence of the king do not give yourself airs, do not take a place among the great;

Pro 25:7 better to be invited, “Come up here”, than be humiliated in the presence of the prince.

Pro 25:8 What your eyes have witnessed do not produce too quickly at the trial, for what are you to do at the
end should your neighbour confute you?

Pro 25:9 Have the quarrel out with your neighbour, but do not disclose another’s secret,

Pro 25:10 for fear your listener put you to shame, and the loss of repute be irremediable.

Pro 25:1 1 Like apples of gold inlaid with silver is a word that is aptly spoken.

Pro 25:12 A golden ring, an ornament of finest gold, is a wise rebuke to an attentive ear.

Pro 25:13 The coolness of snow in harvest time, such is a trustworthy messenger to those who send him: he
revives the soul of his master.

Pro 25:14 Clouds and wind, but no rain: such is anyone whose promises are princely but never kept.

Pro 25:15 With patience a judge may be cajoled: a soft tongue breaks bones.

Pro 25:16 Eat to your satisfaction what honey you may find, but not to excess or you will bring it up again.

Pro 25:17 Do not set foot too often in your neighbour’s house, for fear the neighbour tire of you and come to
hate you.

Pro 25:18 A mace, a sword, a piercing arrow, such is anyone who bears false witness against a companion.

Pro 25:19 Decaying tooth, lame foot, such is the fickle when trusted in time of trouble:

Pro 25:20 as well take off your coat in bitter weather. You are pouring vinegar on a wound when you sing songs
to a sorrowing heart.

Pro 25:21 If your enemy is hungry, give him something to eat; if thirsty, something to drink.

Pro 25:22 By this you will be heaping red-hot coals on his head, and Yahweh will reward you.

Pro 25:23 The north wind begets the rain, and a backbiting tongue, black looks.

Pro 25:24 Better the corner of a roof to live on than a house shared with a quarrelsome woman.

Pro 25:25 Cold water to a thirsty throat; such is good news from a distant land.

Pro 25:26 A churned — up spring, a fountain fouled; such is the upright person trembling before the wicked.

Pro 25:27 It is not good to eat too much honey, nor to seek for glory on top of glory.

Pro 25:28 An open town, and without defences: such is anyone who lacks self-control.

Pro 26:1 Snow no more befits the summer, nor rain the harvest-time, than honours befit a fool.

Pro 26:2 As the sparrow escapes, and the swallow flies away, so the undeserved curse will never hit its mark.
Pro 26:3 A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, and for the backs of fools, a stick.

Pro 26:4 Do not answer a fool in the terms of his folly for fear you grow like him yourself.

Pro 26:5 Answer a fool in the terms of his folly for fear he imagine himself wise.

Pro 26:6 He wounds himself, he takes violence for his drink, who sends a message by a fool.

Pro 26:7 Unreliable as the legs of the lame, so is a proverb in the mouth of fools.

Pro 26:8 As well tie the stone to the sling as pay honour to a fool.

Pro 26:9 A thorn branch in a drunkard’s hand, such is a proverb in the mouth of fools.

Pro 26:10 An archer wounding everyone, such is he who hires the passing fool and drunkard.

Pro 26:1 1 As a dog returns to its vomit, so a fool reverts to his folly.

Pro 26:12 You see someöne who thinks himself wise? More to be hoped for from a fool than from him!

Pro 26:13 “A wild beast on the road!”. says the idler, “a lion in the streets!”.

Pro 26:14 The door turns on its hinges, the idler on his bed.

Pro 26:15 Into the dish the idler dips his hand, but is too tired to bring it back to his mouth.



Pro 26:16 The idler thinks himself wiser than seven people who answer with discretion.

Pro 26:17 He takes a stray dog by the ears, who meddles in someöne else’s quarrel.

Pro 26:18 Like a madman hurling firebrands, arrows and death,

Pro 26:19 so is anyone who lies to a companion and then says, “Aren’t I amusing?”.

Pro 26:20 No wood, and the fire goes out; no slanderer, and quarrelling dies down.

Pro 26:21 Charcoal for live embers, wood for fire, and the quarrelsome for kindling strife.

Pro 26:22 The words of a slanderer are tasty morsels that go right down into the belly.

Pro 26:23 Base silver-plate on top of clay: such are fervent lips and a wicked heart.

Pro 26:24 Whoëver hates may hide it in speech, but deep within lies treachery;

Pro 26:25 do not trust such a person’s pretty speeches, since in the heart lurk seven abominations.

Pro 26:26 Hatred may disguise itself with guile, to reveal its wickedness later in the assembly.

Pro 26:27 Whoëver digs a pit falls into it, the stone comes back on him that rolls it.

Pro 26:28 The lying tongue hates its victims, the wheedling mouth causes ruin.

Pro 27:1 Do not congratulate yourself about tomorrow, since you do not know what today will bring forth.

Pro 27:2 Let someöne else sing your praises, but not your own mouth, a stranger, but not your own lips.

Pro 27:3 Heavy is the stone, weighty is the sand; heavier than both — a grudge borne by a fool.

Pro 27:4 Cruel is wrath, overwhelming is anger; but jealousy, who can withstand that?

Pro 27:5 Better open reproof than feigned love.

Pro 27:6 Trustworthy are blows from a friend, deceitful are kisses from a foe.

Pro 27:7 The gorged throat revolts at honey, the hungry throat finds all bitterness sweet.

Pro 27:8 Like a bird that strays from its nest, so is anyone who strays away from home.

Pro 27:9 Oil and perfume gladden the heart, and the sweetness of friendship rather than self-reliance.

Pro 27:10 Do not give up your friend or your father’s friend; when trouble comes, do not go off to your brother’s
house, better a near neighbour than a distant brother.

Pro 27:1 1 Learn to be wise, my child, and gladden my heart, that I may have an answer for anyone who insults
me.

Pro 27:12 The discreet sees danger and takes shelter, simpletons go ahead and pay the penalty.

Pro 27:13 Take the man’s clothes! He has gone surety for a stranger. Take a pledge from him, for persons
unknown.

Pro 27:14 Whoëver at dawn loudly blesses his neighbour — it will be reckoned to him as a curse.

Pro 27:15 The dripping of a gutter on a rainy day and a quarrelsome woman are alike;

Pro 27:16 whoëver can restrain her, can restrain the wind, and take a firm hold on grease.

Pro 27:17 Iron is sharpened by iron, one person is sharpened by contact with another.

Pro 27:18 Whoëver tends the fig tree eats its figs, whoëver looks after his master will be honoured.

Pro 27:19 As water reflects face back to face, so one human heart reflects another.

Pro 27:20 Sheol and Perdition are never satisfied, insatiable, too, are human eyes.

Pro 27:21 A furnace for silver, a foundry for gold: a person is worth what his reputation is worth.

Pro 27:22 Pound a fool in a mortar, among grain with a pestle, his folly will not leave him.

Pro 27:23 Know your flocks’ condition well, take good care of your herds;

Pro 27:24 for riches do not last for ever, crowns do not hand themselves on from age to age.

Pro 27:25 The grass once gone, the aftergrowth appearing, the hay gathered in from the mountains,

Pro 27:26 you should have lambs to clothe you, goats to buy you a field,

Pro 27:27 goat’s milk sufficient to feed you, to feed your household and provide for your serving girls.

Pro 28:1 The wicked flees when no one is pursuing, the upright is bold as a lion.

Pro 28:2 A country in revolt throws up many leaders: with one person wise and experienced, you have stability.
Pro 28:3 The wicked oppresses the weak: here is a devastating rain — and farewell, bread!

Pro 28:4 Those who forsake the law sing the praises of the wicked, those who observe the law are angered by
them.

Pro 28:5 The wicked do not know what justice means, those who seek Yahweh understand everything.

Pro 28:6 Better someöne poor living an honest life than someöne of devious ways however rich.

Pro 28:7 An intelligent child is one who keeps the Law; an associate of profligates brings shame on his father.
Pro 28:8 Whoëver increases wealth by usury and interest amasses it for someöne else who will bestow it on the
poor.

Pro 28:17 A man guilty of murder will flee till he reaches his tomb: let no one halt him!

Pro 28:18 Whoëver lives an honest life will be safe, whoëver wavers between two ways falls down in one of
them.

Pro 30:3 I have not learnt wisdom, and I lack the knowledge of the holy ones.

Pro 30:4 Who has mounted to the heavens, then come down again? Who has gathered the wind in the clasp of

Pro 30:1 1 There is a breed of person that curses his father and does not bless his mother;

Pro 30:12 a breed that, laying claim to purity, has not yet been cleansed of its filth;

Pro 30:13 a breed haughty of eye, with disdain in every glance;

Pro 30:14 a breed with swords for teeth, with knives for jaws, devouring the oppressed from the earth and the
needy from the land.

Pro 30:15 The leech has two daughters: “Give! Give!”. There are three insatiable things, four, indeed, that never
say, “Enough!”.

Pro 30:16 Sheol, the barren womb, earth which can never have its fill of water, fire which never says, “Enough!”.

Pro 30:17 The eye which looks jeeringly on a father, and scorns the obedience due to a mother, will be pecked

out by the ravens of the valley, and eaten by the vultures.

Pro 30:18 There are three things beyond my comprehension, four, indeed, that I do not understand:

Pro 30:19 the way of an eagle through the skies, the way of a snake over the rock, the way of a ship in mid-
ocean, the way of a man with a girl.

Pro 30:20 This is how an adulteress behaves: she eats, then wipes her mouth and says, “I have done nothing
wrong!”.

Pro 30:21 There are three things at which the earth trembles, four, indeed, which it cannot endure:

Pro 30:23 a hateful woman wed at last, a servant girl inheriting from her mistress.

Pro 30:24 There are four creatures little on the earth, though they are wisest of the wise:

Pro 30:26 the coneys, a race without defences, yet they make their home in the rocks;

Pro 30:27 locusts, which have no king, yet they all march in good order;

Pro 30:28 lizards, which you can catch in your hand, yet they frequent the palaces of kings.

Pro 30:29 There are three things of stately tread, four, indeed, of stately walk:

Pro 30:30 the lion, bravest of beasts, he will draw back from nothing;

Pro 30:31 a vigorous cock, a he-goat, and the king when he harangues his people.

Pro 30:32 If you have been foolish enough to fly into a passion and now have second thoughts, lay your hand

Pro 31 :2 What, my son! What, son of my womb! What, son of my vows!

Pro 31 :3 Do not expend your energy on women nor your wealth on those who ruin kings.

Pro 31 :4 Not for kings, O Lemuel, not for kings the drinking of wine, not for princes the love of liquor,

Pro 31 :5 for fear that in liquor they forget what they have decreed and pervert the course of justice against all
the poor.

Pro 31 :6 Procure strong drink for someöne about to die, wine for him whose heart is heavy:

Pro 31 :7 let him drink and forget his misfortune, and remember his misery no more.

Pro 31 :8 Make your views heard, on behalf of the dumb, on behalf of all the unwanted;

Pro 31 :9 make your views heard, pronounce an upright verdict, defend the cause of the poor and the wretched.
Pro 31:10 The truly capable woman — who can find her? She is far beyond the price of pearls.

Pro 31:11 Her husband’s heart has confidence in her, from her he will derive no little profit.

Pro 31:12 Advantage and not hurt she brings him all the days of her life.

Pro 31:13 She selects wool and flax, she does her work with eager hands.

Pro 31:14 She is like those merchant vessels, bringing her food from far away.

Pro 31:15 She gets up while it is still dark giving her household their food, giving orders to her serving girls.

Pro 31:16 She sets her mind on a field, then she buys it; with what her hands have earned she plants a
vineyard.

Pro 31:17 She puts her back into her work and shows how strong her arms can be.

Pro 31:18 She knows that her affairs are going well; her lamp does not go out at night.

Pro 31:19 She sets her hands to the distaff, her fingers grasp the spindle.

Pro 31 :20 She holds out her hands to the poor, she opens her arms to the needy.

Pro 31 :21 Snow may come, she has no fears for her household, with all her servants warmly clothed.

Pro 31 :22 She makes her own quilts, she is dressed in fine linen and purple.

Pro 31 :23 Her husband is respected at the city gates, taking his seat among the elders of the land.

Pro 31 :24 She weaves materials and sells them, she supplies the merchant with sashes.



Pro 31 :25 She is clothed in strength and dignity, she can laugh at the day to come.

Pro 31 :26 When she opens her mouth, she does so wisely; on her tongue is kindly instruction.

Pro 31 .21 She keeps good watch on the conduct of her household, no bread of idleness for her.

Pro 31 :28 Her children stand up and proclaim her blessed, her husband, too, sings her praises:

Pro 31 :29 “Many women have done admirable things, but you surpass them all!”.

Pro 31 :30 Charm is deceitful, and beauty empty; the woman who fears Yahweh is the one to praise.

Pro 31 :31 Give her a share in what her hands have worked for, and let her works tell her praises at the city
gates.
